1164441,PEOPLE v. COLEMAN,1881-12,"Upon the question of insanity the court charged the jury as follows:
Davis, J.
â€”Insanity is usually spoken of, both in common language and in the books, as a defense to crime. But it is no defense, because, where the insanity recognized by the law exists, there can be no crime to defend. An insane person is incapable of crime. He is devoid, both in morals and in law, of the elements essential to the constitution of crime, and hence is am object of pity and protection, and not of punishment. Therefore, whenever it is established that a party accused of crime was, at the time of its alleged commission, insane within the established rules of the criminal law, he is entitled to acquittal on the ground of innocence, because of incapacity to commit the offense, however monstrous his physical act may appear. Both humanity and the law revolt against the conviction and punishment of such a person. But insanity is a condition easily asserted and sometimes altogether too easily accepted. Hence, juries, while they should be careful to see to it that no really insane person is found guilty of crime, should be equally careful that no guilty person escapes under an ill-founded pretext of insanity.
It is important that juries on trials of alleged crime should clearly understand what insanity is, within the.established rules' of the criminal law. Without such rules the administration of justice in such cases would be dependent upon the shifting caprices of courts, or the equally unsubstantial passi-ons and prejudices of jurors. In this State the test of responsibility for criminal acts, where insanity is asserted, is the capacity of the accused to distinguish between right and wrong at the time and with respect to the act which is the subject of inquiry. This rule is stated by the authorities in different forms, but always in the same substance. In one case it was said â€?the inquiry is always brought down to the single question of a capacity to distinguish between right and wrong at the time the act was done.â€?This was in the Freeman caseâ€”the celebrated case of the colored man who was tried for murder in Cayuga county and defended by the late William II. Seward.
In the most authoritative of the English cases, it is said, â€?it must be clearly proved that at the time of committing the offense, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.â€?And in a very late case in our court of appeals, a charge in that exact language was held to present the law correctly to the jury.
So you will see, gentleman of the jury, that in this case, the firing by the prisoner of the shot by which -the deceased was killed, being proved and admitted, and evidence to show the alleged insanity having been given, the question whether the act was criminal depends upon your finding, as a matter of fact, whether, at the time of doing the act, the prisoner knew what she was doing, and that she was doing a wrongâ€”or, in other words, did she know that she' was shooting the deceased, and that such shooting was a wrongful act ? If she did know these things, her alleged insanity is not established within the rules of the law, however much you may be convinced that she acted under the intensest emotional excitement, or howeve â€?fully she believed she was justified in avenging her own wrongs, or however much you may think the deceased was deserving of punishment. The doctrine that a criminal act may be excused upon the notion of an irresistible impulse to commit it, when the offender has the ability to discover his legal and moral duty in respect to it, has no place in the law ; and there is no form of insanity known to the law as a shield for an act otherwise criminal, in which the faculties are so disordered or deranged that a man, although he perceives the moral quality of his acts as wrong, is unable to control them, and is urged by some mysterious pressure to the commission of the act, the consequences of which he anticipates and knows.
This is substantially the language of the court of appeals in the case already referred to. If this were not the law, every thief, to establish his irresponsibility, could assert an irresistible impulse to steal, which he had not mental or moral force sufficient to resist, though knowing the wrongful nature of the act; and in every homicide it would only be necessary, in order to escape punishment, to assert that anger or hatred or revenge or an overwhelming desire to redress an injury, or a belief that the killing is for some private or public good, has produced an irresistible impulse to do a known illegal and wrongful act. So that really there could never be a conviction if the guilty party should assert and maintain an irresistible impulse, produced by some pressure which he could not resist, as a reason for committing a crime. To restrain such impulses is the legal and moral duty of all men, and the protection of society demands that he who yields to them must take the consequences of his acts.
You will understand, therefore, the exact distinctions upon which the law in criminal cases stands in respect to responsibility, to wit: that the party who does the act knows what he is doing. If he is imbecileâ€”that is, if he has not sense enough to know what he is doing, when he fires a pistol at another : then he is not amenable to the law as a criminal, because of his mental incapacity. But if he has knowledge enough to know that he is firing a pistolâ€”that he is shooting a person, and thereby doing an act injurious, or likely to be injurious to that person, and also has sufficient sense to know that that act is a wrongful oneâ€”he cannot assert an irresistible impulse arising from any cause whatever as a defense or excuse. Whatever the views of scientists or of theorists on the subject of insanity may be, and however great a variety of classifications they may adopt, the law in a criminal case brings the whole to this single test: Did the person doing the act at that time have sufficient sense to know what he was doing, and that it was wrong to do it 1 If that be his 'condition, it is of no consequence that he acts under an irresistible influence or a supposed inspiration in committing the wrong, or a belief that the wrong will produce some greater good. Emotional insanity, impulsive insanity, insanity of the will or of the moral sense, all vanish into thin air whenever it appears that the accused party knew the difference between right and wrong at the time and in respect of the act he committed. No imaginary inspiration to do a personal wrrong to another under a delusion or belief that some great public or private benefit will flow from it, where the nature of the act done and its probable consequences to the injured party, and that it is in itself wrong, are known to the actor, can amount to that insanity which in law disarms the act of criminality. Under such notions of legal insanity, life, property and rights, both public and private, would be altogether insecure; and every man who by brooding over his wrongs, real or imaginary, shall work himself up to an â€?irresistible impulse â€?to avenge himself, can with impunity become a self-elected judge, jury and executioner in his own case for the redress of his own injuries or of the wrongs of his friends, his party or his country. But happily, gentlemen of the jury, that is not the law; and whenever such ideas of insanity are applied to a given case as the law (as too often they have been), crime escapes punishment, not through the legal insanity of the accused, but through the emotional insanity of courts and juries.
I have felt it my duty to give you my views of the law of insanity, as applicable to the case, in emphatic terms; but I assure you, gentlemen, I have no intention, in doing so, to affect your minds in determining the facts of the case to which you arc to apply the law. The prisoner is entitled to a consideration, of the facts of the case by. you, uninfluenced by any expression of opinion in respect to them by the court.
Having shown you the law of insanity applicable to the ease, it is important that I should give you the law in respect to its proof. The law presumes sanity in all cases. That presumption in a criminal case is prima facie evidence of the sanity of the accused party, and, where no evidence tending to show the contrary is produced, the case of the people, so far as relates to the question of sanity, is made out. The burden of overthrowing the presumption of sanity is upon the person who alleges insanity, and if evidence be given by him tending to rebut the presumption and to show insanity, then the general question is presented to the jury whether the alleged crime was committed by a person responsible for his acts, under the rules of law which have already been laid down. Upon the question thus presented, the presumption of sanity and the evidence tending to prove or disprove insanity are all to be considered by the jury, and at that stage of the case the question of sanity, like all other material questions of fact, becomes one on which the prosecution holds the affirmative, and if reasonable doubt of sanity then exists upon the evidence before the jury, the prisoner is entitled to the benefit of that doubt as upon any other material question of fact.
How, gentlemen, this is a presentation of the law in relation to insanity as applied to criminal cases. We are not dealing witli civil actions arising upon contracts or under wills, where a question of sufficient capacity to make the instrument, or of undue influence, is presented, but with the law as established to prevent crimes of violence or wrong, against which society must have power to protect itself. The inquiry for yon in this case, I repeat, is whether or not, at the time the accused committed the act, she knew what she was doingâ€”to wit: that she was shooting the deceased; and knew that in shooting him she was doing a wrongful act. If those two conditions of things existed, then the assertion of insanity fails. Although she may have been laboring under the intensest excitement, and although the impulse to do the act because of the injury she alleges she had received was of such a character that she felt herself justified in avenging her wrongs, yet the defense of insanity would altogether fail.' The moment it is conceded, as I have already said, that a man can assert insanity as an excuse for his otherwise criminal act, because his passions were so far aroused that it was impossible for him to stay his hand, there is no protection for society. Any man who wishes to kill his enemy or any one whom he believes or fancies has injured him, lias only to bring himself up to that condition of intense emotion that he can no longer restrain himself, then do the killing, and then assert in a court' of justice that he was insane because his passion had passed all bounds of restraint. It' is easy for the mind least familiar with law to see that whenever that con dition of things is held to bo legal insanity there can be no such thing as protection of life under the law, for the law itself will abrogate all reasonable ground for its own enforcement.

1164497,WALKER v. PEOPLE,1881-10,"Brady, J.
â€”The-plaintiff in error Avas indicted and tried for the prime of abduction, and was convicted and sentenced to the state prison for the term of ten years. The response made to the charge was insanity; upon the trial, the counsel for the plaintiff in error requested the court to charge, first, that the true test of criminal responsibility, where the defense of insanity is interposed to an indictment, is, whether the accused had sufficient reason to knoAV right from wrong, and Avhether or not he had sufficient poAver of control to govern his actions. The learned recorder, in answer to this request, said:
â€?I Avill charge the first part of that proposition, namely, â€?the true test of criminal responsibility, Avhere the defense of insanity is interposed to an indictment, is, Avhether the accused had sufficient reason to know right from wrong.â€?â€?But he further said : â€?I decline to charge the latter part, namely, â€?and Avhether or not he had sufficient power to govern and control his actions.â€?â€?The prisoner, by his counsel, excepted to the refusal to charge as requested.
The counsel for the prisoner also requested the recorder to charge that the defendant, in a criminal case, Avas not required, to prove his insanity in order to avail himself of that defense, but merely to create a reasonable doubt upon that point â€œwhereupon the burden of proving sanity falls upon the people.â€?The learned recorder declined to charge as requested, and the counsel for the plaintiff in error duly excepted.
The recorder in his charge to the jury, said that to establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proven that at the time of committing the act, which is the subject of the indictment, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, and, if he did know it, that he did not know that he was doing wrong.
Counsel for the plaintiff in error excepted to the words â€?clearly proven,â€?as used in this extract from the charge, and the exception was duly noted.
It will be perceived, in reference to the first request, that, in addition to the proposition as to the capacity of the plaintiff in error to know right from wrong, it was designed by his counsel to create another test or condition, namely, as to whether the plaintiff in error had sufficient power to govern and control his actions, which is to say, in effect, if he had sufficient reason to know right from wrong, and knowing it, had not sufficient power to control and govern his actions, and did the act charged, with a knowledge, therefore, that it was wrong, the act was to be regarded as that of an insane person, and one irresponsible for his deed.
It is enough to say that there is no precedent for such a combination of elements, as is presented in this request. The true test, upon the authorities, is that announced by the learned recorder, namely, whether the accused had sufficient reason to know right from wrong, and if he had sufficient intelligence to know it, whether lie had sufficient power to control or govern his actions, was a matter of no moment whatever. Assuming that he had reason enough to know that he was doing wrong when he committed the act of which he stood accused, it was his duty to control himself, a duty which he owed to God and man, and one, for the omission of which, under the law"" of the land, he was to be punished. The courts have gone quite far enough in declaring that if the accused is laboring under such a * defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he is doing, and if he did know it, that he did not know that he was doing wrong, he should be regarded as irresponsible for the act charged against him.
There are some obiter dicta which would seem to evidence an intention to shroud this doctrine in doubt, or to hamper it with conditions subversive of its clearness and efficacy, but they have not been adopted in any adjudicated case as expressive of the law of this state. If, when a person is put upon trial, it is urged on his behalf that he was insane at the time of the commission of the crime of which he is accused, he is not entitled to the benefit of the rule governing that averment to any greater extent than that expressed by the recorder in this case ; and it is to be given to the jury, as a rule, without conditions and without qualifications. If the testimony submitted for the-consideration of the jury established such mental infirmity as the rule itself suggests, then the prisoner is entitled to his discharge upon the ground of his irresponsibility. But if the testimony does not fully respond to these requirements, then he must suffer as a person presumed to be sane, and on whose behalf sufficient evidence had not been given to overcome this presumption. Freeman v. People, 4 Denio, 9; Willis v. People, 32 N. Y. 717; Flanagan v. People, 52 Id. 467. This is all that it is deemed necessary to say with regard to the first request.
The second request herein stated is subtle in its character ; it is that the defendant in a criminal case is not required to prove his insanity, in order to avail himself of that defence, but merely to create a reasonable doubt upon this point, whereupon the burden of proving insanity falls upon the people. It would be sufficient, in answer to the exception which was taken to the refusal of the recorder to charge this request, that the burden of proving sanity does not fall upon the people in any case. The prisoner is arraigned, and the jury are impanneled with two legal presumptions existingâ€”one that he is innocent, and the other that he is sane. If the prisoner is to be relieved from the consequences of his offense, by reason of a mental infirmity existing at the time of his transgression, amounting to insanity, it becomes his duty, or the duty of some person on his behalf, to overcome the presumption of sanity by satisfactory evidence, and the people may rest upon the presumption of sanity without resorting to any proof. This point has been expressly decided in Walter v. People, reported in 32 N. Y. 147, which was a case of homicide. The court â€?was requested to charge, as a proposition of law, that in a case where the defense consists of the insanity of the prisoner, it becomes incumbent upon the prosecution to prove him sane. The court said that, as an abstract proposition, the request was manifestly unsound ; that sanity was presumed to be the normal state of the human mind, and that it was never incumbent upon the prosecution to give affirmative evidence that such a state exists in a particular case. And this doctrine was reaffirmed in the case of Ferris v. People, reported in 35 N. Y. 125, and again reasserted in the case of Brotherton v. People, 75 N. Y. 162, in which Judge Church, delivering the opinion of the court, said :
â€?Sanity being the normal and usual condition of mankind, the law presumes that every individual is in that state ; hence a prosecutor may rest upon that presumption without other proof. The fact is deemed to be proof prima facie?
Inasmuch as the request contained more, therefore, than the prisoner was entitled to, the recorder was not obliged to charge it, under well settled rules. In addition, however to this response, it must be further said, that the request, aside from the objectionable portion which has been referred to, from its phraseology called upon him to declare that the defendant in a criminahcase was not required to prove.his insanity, in order to avail himself of that defense, but merely to create a reasonable doubt upon this point, namely upon the point of insanity. The learned counsel for the plaintiff in error, no doubt, designed to state that it was sufficient for his client to create a reasonable doubt upon his sanity, but the request does not contain that proposition. If there were nothing else to be said upon this particular element of the case, this view might be regarded as hypercritical, but the learned recorder substantially charged upon the rule which the prisonerâ€™s counsel doubtless intended to invoke by the request itself, for he said, after referring to the evidence of insanity:
â€?It is for you to determine, upon all this evidence, whether or not on June 15, 1881, when it is alleged that this man perpetrated the offense of abducting this child, he was sane or insane; in other words, whether his mind was in such a condition that he â€?was perfectly able to comprehend and understand the difference between right and wrong, and that lie did know that he was doing â– a wrong act, if he had sufficient mind to form that intent which the law requires must be proved to exist; and it is for you to determine those questions: they are' purely questions of fact. If you come to the conclusion that the prisoner was insane at the time it is charged he perpetrated this crime, you will find him not guilty on the ground of insanity. If you come to. the conclusion beyond all reasonable doubt, that he committed the crime 'of abduction as I have defined it; if the testimony satisfies you beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt, and that lie was not insane, it will be your duty to convict; and further, if there is any reasonable doubt arising upon the evidence in the case, and upon nothing else, it will be your duty to give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt and acquit him.â€?, It must be further said in regard to this request, that in the case of Brotherton v. People, supra, it appeared that the judge in charging the jury used this expression: â€?The allegation of insanity is an affirmative issue, which the defendant is bound to prove, and you must be satisfied from the testimony introduced by him that he was insane.â€?And he further charged that if there was a well founded doubt, whether the man was insane at the time he fired the pistol, the jury were to acquit him. It was held that in these two paragraphs of the charge taken together there was no error, and the court in reviewing the trial said that the prisoner was bound to prove that he was not sane, and whether insanity was called an affirmative issue, or it is stated that the burden of proof of insanity is on the prisoner in order to overcome the presumption of sanity, is not very material.if the jury are told, as they were, that a reasonable doubt upon that question entitled the prisoner to an acquittal.
The jury in this case were told that if they came to the conclusion that the prisoner was insane at the time it was charged he perpetrated the crime, they were to find him not guilty on the ground of insanity, and further, that if they came to the"" conclusion beyond all reasonable doubt that he committed the crime, and that he was not insane, it was their duty to convict â–?him; and further, that if there was any reasonable doubt arising â€?from' the evidence in the case, he was entitled to the benefit of that doubt, and it was their duty to acquit him. â–?They were substantially charged, therefore, that if there was a doubt about the guilt of the plaintiff in error, arising either from his innocence of the crime itself, or from a doubt as to his sanity, that he was entitled to a verdict of acquittal.
It will have been perceived that in the case of Brotherton, to which reference has' been made, the charge was directly to the effect that the insanity urged on behalf of the prisoner was an affirmative issue, which he was bound to prove, and that the jury must be satisfied on the testimony introduced by him that he was insane, which was not done in this case. The learned recorder charged-that to establish the defense of insanity it must be clearly proven that at the time of committing the act which was the subject of the indictment, the party accused was under a defect of reason from a disease of the mind ; so that the case of Brotherton and this one are, in the respects in which they have been compared, in harmony.
From what has been said, the view entertained of the exception to the charge in which the learned recorder used the words â€œclearly provenâ€?may be foreshadowed. The exception in this respect is regarded as valueless. As already suggested, taken in connection with another paragraph, to which reference has been made herein, it is no. broader than the charge sustained in the case of Brotherton v. People, supra. In that case it was charged that the prisonerâ€™s insanity was an affirmative issue which he was bound to prove, and in this case it was declared to be a defense, which must be clearly proven. The cases are analogous and parallel. The precise question presented by the exception, although it has not been definitely decided in this state, and although it may seem to be in doubt (see People v. McCann, 58 N. Y. 18; Flanagan v. People, 52 Id. 467), appears to have been answered in the case of McNaghten, 110 Clark & Fin. 210, in which Lord Chief Justice Tinbale said, that'the jury should be told that â€œto establish a defense on the ground of insanity it must be clearly proven that at the time of committing the act the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason from a disease of. the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did' know it, that he did not know what he was- doing was wrong.â€?This case is regarded, therefore,, as an express authority for the proposition that the defense of insanity must be clearly proven in order to overcome the presumption of sanity, which the prisoner encounters at the commencement of his trial.
The question of insanity, in its legal phases, may be a very interesting subject to discuss. It certainly presents a very broad field when contemplated with the numerous adjudications, both in this country and in England, affecting it, and the number of elementary writers who have considered it; but it is not necessarily the duty of an appellate court to write a review of these cases. It is enough to express the conclusion arrived at in regard to it when presented for examination, upon consideration of the controlling decisions in this state bearing upon it. This has been done in this opinion, and it follows that the judgment must be affirmed.
Daniels, J.
The law of this case seems to have been carefully observed at the trial. Upon both the important points presented, the instructions given the jury were in strict accord with the authorities which have long been regarded as correct expositions of the law. In MchTaghtenâ€™s case, the proper course to be followed in the disposition of the defense of insanity was considered and determined by the house of lords, the highest English judicial authority. And it was then held that â€œevery man is to be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until .the contrary be proved.â€?And â€?to establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.â€?â€?If the accused was conscious that the act was one which he ought not to do, and if that was, at the same time, contrary to the law of the land, he is punishable.â€?10 Clark & F. 200, 210. The same subject received the consideration of the court of appeals in Flanagan v. People, 52 N. Y. 467.. And the same criterion was sanction for the disposition of the defense of insanity, as that which was adopted by the preceding case in England. And in the latter case it was further held that the accused was not entitled to an acquittal, simply because the criminal act might have been committed in subordination to some irresistible impulse or inclination. This point was urged in behalf of the prisoner in that case, by the same learned counsel now reprerenting the present plaintiff in error, and it was answered by the court, in very plain language, as follows : â€?Indulgence in evil passions weakens the restraining power of the will and conscience, and the rule suggested would be the cover for the commission of crime and its justification. The doctrine that a criminal act may be excused upon the notion of an irresistible impulse to commit it, where the offender has the ability to discover his legal and moral duty in respect to it, has no place in the law.â€?And the remark of an able English justice, that â€?Every crime was committed under an influence of such a description. and the object of the law was to compel people to control these influences,â€?was repeated with approval. Id. 470. In Reg. v. Haynes, 1 Foster & F. 666, this subject was further considered, and it was there observed that â€?if an influence he so powerful as to be termed irresistible, so much the more reason is there why we should not withdraw any of the safeguards tending to counteract it. There are three powerful restraints existing, all tending to the assistance of the person who is suffering under such an influence : the restraint of religion, the restraint of conscience, and the restraint of the law. But if the influence itself be held to be a legal excuse, rendering the crime dispunishable, you at once withdraw a most powerful restraint, that forbidding and punishing its perpetration. We ""must, therefore, return to the simple question : 1 Did the prisoner know the nature of the act he was doing, and did he know he was doing what. was wrong Ã­ â€?â€?(Id. 667). These principles present the gist and substance of the law upon these subjects. They have been discussed in very many other instances, and concurring in the same conclusions. For that reason, particular, reference to them is at the pzâ€™esent time not necessary. To a gz-eat extent, they are considered in the charge of Mr. Justice Brady, to which concurrence and approval may very properly be given. For the reasons assigned by-'him, and those suggested by Presiding Justice .Davis, and maintained in such plain langnÃ¡ge as to preclude the possibility of misapprehension on the occasions just referred to, this conviction should be affirmed.
Davis, P. J.
On the question, what constitutes;'the insanity whicli in law exonerates from the punishment of crime, on the ground of irresponsibility,-I concur fully in the views and conclusions of my brother Brady. On the question of the burden of proof after evidence has been given by the accused tending to show insanity, the learned recorder had given to* the jury, in Ills charge, the true rule apjffic-able to a ease of the kind when it comes upon all the evidence to be submitted to the jury, and having done this, it was no error to refuse to submit upon the part of the prisoner a proposition which, if correct in itself, was only calculated to confuse the jury by distracting their attention from the real question which, upon the whole evidence, had already been correctly submitted to them. The recorder committed no legal error in refusing to charge as requested, in the fortÃ­n presented by the counsel for the prisoner. I concur, therefore, in the affirmance.
Conviction affirmed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164418,WALKER v. PEOPLE,1882-02,"Rapallo, J.
The prisoner was indicted and tried in the court of general sessions of the city of New York for abducting one Katie Ilennessy, a child between seven and eight years of age. The evidence tended to show that the purpose of the abductor was to take indecent liberties with her. The defense was insanity, and evidence was adduced on the part of the prisoner-in support of that defense.
The only errors alleged in- the ease are the refusal of the recorder to charge certain propositions submitted by the counsel for dhe prisoner, and the charge of the recorder on the subject of the proof of insanity required of the prisoner. The exceptions to these rulings will be examined seriatim. The first request was to charge â€?that the test of criminal responsibility where the defense of insanity is interposed to an indictment is, whether the accused had sufficient reason to know right from wrong, and whether or not he had sufficient power of control to govern his actions.â€?The recorder charged the first part of this proposition, but declined to charge the latter part, â€?whether or not lie had sufficient power of control to govern his actions.â€?The doctrine of irresponsibility for a crime committed by a person who had sufficient mental capacity to comprehend the nature and quality of his act and to know that it was wrong, on the ground that he had not the power to control his actions, has not met with favor in the adjudications in this state. Flanagan v. People, 52 N. Y. 467. But without entering upon a discussion of the question on its general merits, we are of opinion that in the present case it would have been clearly improper to submit to the jury .any such vague test as that requested, when considered with reference to the character of the crime for which the prisoner was on trial, and the testimony which was before the jury as to his previous similar offenses.
The jury, upon the evidence, might have found that the prisoner had an uncontrollable propensity to abduct young girls, or that his appetites were so depraved and overpowering that he was unable to resist them, and if they so found, the charge, as requested, would have led them to suppose that it was their duty to acquit, even though they were satisfied that he was possessed of sufficient reason to know that the act was wrong and criminal.
The court did charge that a man must have sufficient control of his mental faculties to form a criminal intent, before he can be held responsible for a criminal act. This we think was as far as the court could go on the subject of control, under the circumstances of this case.
The second proposition requested to be cliarged was: â€?Where a person acts under the influence of mental disease he is not criminally accountable.â€?This the recorder declined to charge, except as he intended to charge, and he did charge in the words of the statute, that â€?no act done by a person in a state of insanity can be punished as an offense.â€?This was a much more accurate statement of the law than that requested, and it was not error for the recorder to give it the preference, and decline to adopt the phraseology of counsel.
The third request to charge was that â€?the defendant in a criminal case is not required to prove his insanity in order to avail himself of that defense, but merely to create a reasonable doubt upon this point, whereupon the burden of proving his sanity falls upon the people.â€?This request was refused, and an exception taken.
The recorder, in his charge, instructed the jury on the subject of the burden of proof as to the sanity of the prisoner, in entire accordance with the decisions of this court. After having instructed them, in a manner not excepted to, as to what constituted sanity and insanity, lie said to them: â€?It is for you to determine those questions; they are purely questions of fact. If you come to the conclusion that the prisoner was insane at the time it is charged that he perpetrated this crime, you will find him not guilty on the ground of insanity. If you come to the conclusion beyond all reasonable doubt, that he committed the crirnÃ© of abduction, as I have defined it; if the testimony satisfies you, beyond a reasonable doubt, of his guilt, and that he was not insane, it will be your duty to convict. If there is any reasonable doubt arising on the evidence in the case, and upon nothing else, it will be your duty to give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt and acquit him.â€?The burden of establishing, beyond a reasonable doubt, as one of the elements of guilt, that the prisoner was not insane, was by this charge cast upon the prosecution.
Indeed, on examining the whole case it appears that the sanity of the prisoner was the only controverted point, the sole defense being his insanity, and it was the only serious question presented for the consideration of the jury.
The most recent expression of this court, in respect to the burden of proof in eases where the defense of insanity is interposed, is contained in the opinion of Danfobth, J., in the .recent case of Oâ€™Connell v. People, 87 N. Y. 377. It was there said, in substance, that the guilt of the prisoner depended upon two questions, viz.: whether lie committed the act charged, and whether he was in such condition of mind as to be responsible; that the burden of proof as to both was upon the prosecution; that the legal presumption that every man is sane, was sufficient to establish his sanity until repelled by proof; that if the prisoner gave no evidence, the fact stood. If he gave evidence tending to overthrow it, the prosecutor might produce answering testimony, but he must satisfy the juiy, upon the whole evidence, that the prisoner was responsible ; for the affirmative of the issue tendered by the indictment remained with the prosecution to the end of the trial. See also Brotherton v. People, 75 N. Y. 159.
In the case of Oâ€™Connell v. People, above cited, a specific re- â€?quest was made and the court refused to charge that â€?if from the evidence in the case a reasonable doubt arose in the minds of the jury as to the sanity or insanity of the defendant, that he was entitled to the benefit of that doubt.â€?This proposition' was in the abstract entirely sound, and in accordance with the views expressed by this court, but the refusal to charge it was sustained here, on the ground that the same point was covered by the general charge, in which, after submitting to the jury the question of the sanity or insanity of the prisoner, with the instruction that if insane he was not responsible, the judge charged that if they had a reasonable doubt, from the. evidence, that the prisoner was guilty of the crime, they should give him the benefit of that doubt.
This court held, in substance, that where the judge properly submits to the jury a proposition covering the whole issue, and instructs them that they must find it beyond a reasonable doubt, he cannot be required to subdivide it artd .charge separately as to each of the elements necessary to constitute the crime that it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. In this holding we confirmed the conclusion reached in the present case by the presiding judge at general term, that when the judge gives to the jury in his charge the true rule applicable to the case, when it comes toâ€™be considered on all the evidence, it is not error to refuse .to submit a separate proposition, which, even though correct in itself, is only calculated to confuse the jury by distracting their attention' from the test question, which is to be determined on the whole evidence. These remarks apply specially to the case at bar, for the request to charge is by no means as accurate as that in the' case of Oâ€™Connell. It involved two propositions: first, that the defendant is not bound to prove his insanity to avail himself of that defense. This is inaccurate, for he must, beyond cavil, give proof of it, or the presumption of sanity prevails, and the request was not confined to conclusive proof or proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Secondly, that he is only required to create a reasonable doubt as to his sanity. This is extremely vague, and well calculated to mislead, especially as connected with the first branch of the request. It is not even confined to a doubt arising upon the evidence. But even had the request been framed accurately, our recent decision above referred to holds that it was not error to refuse it, where the point was fully covered by the charge as given.
The remaining exception relates to the charge that â€œto establish a defense of insanity it must bo clearly proved,â€?&c., the exception being to the expression â€?clearly proved.â€?This was not the language of the recorder, but was read from an opinion which he adopted, and .is a quotation from the opinion of Ch. J. Tikdal, given in the celebrated McMaghten case. (10 Clark & Fin. Ap. Cas. 200.) If by this expression the jury were given to understand that the insanity must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, it of course was at variance with the law of this state. People v. McCann, 16 N. Y. 58. But if it meant that there should be clear and substantial evidence of insanity to justify an acquittal on that ground, it was unobjectionable. People v. Schryver, 42 N. Y. 1.
The adoption of the language used in the MuNaghtcn case, that the defense of insanity should be - clearly proved, having been accompanied in the present case with the instruction that if the testimony satisfied the jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the prisoner, and that he was not insane, it would be their duty to convict; but that- if there was any reasonable doubt arising upon the evidence in the case, it would be their duty to give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt and acquit him, the jury could not have been misled as to the burden of proof, or the degree of proof required of the prisoner to overcome the presumption of sanity, and the charge was quite as favorable to him as he was entitled to.
Whatever may have been the idea which the language of Ch. J. Tihdal was intended to convey in the McNaghten case,' we think that it was so qualified in the present case, by the connection in which it was used, and the explanation which accompanied it, that, taking the whole charge together, it amounted to nothing more than that there should be substantial and clear evidence of insanity to justify an acquittal on that ground, and that the defense should not be sustained on vague and shadowy testimony, or mere speculation and conjecture. In Brotherton v. People, 75 N. Y. 162, the judge charged the the jury as follows : â€?The allegation of insanity is an affirmative issue which the defendant is bound to prove, and you must be satisfied from the testimony introduced by him that he was insanebut he also charged: â€?If there is a reasonable doubt, a well-founded doubt, whether the man was insane at the time he fired the pistol, you will acquit him.â€?This court held, that taking the two paragraphs together there was no error.
The opinion in that case was written by our late brother, Ch. J. Church, than whom no judge approached the consideration of criminal cases in a more humane spirit, or'was more careful that all the legal rights of accused persons should be properly guarded; but the natural force and directness of his mind led him to regard the substance of what was said to the jury, rather than nice distinctions in forms of expression, and drew from him the remark that â€?the prisoner was bound to prove that he was not sane, and whether insanity is called an affirmative issue, or it is stated that the burden of proof of insanity is upon the prisoner, is not very material, if the jury are told, as they were in this case, that a reasonable doubt upon that question entitled the prisoner to an acquittal.â€?We think there was no error in the refusals to charge as requested, or in the charge as given, when taken as a whole, and consequently the judgment should be affirmed.
All the judges concurred, except Tract, J., absent.
Note.â€”The following are the leading authorities in the various states on the two most important questions discussed in the foregoing case of â–?Walker Â®. People,â€”namely, the burden of proof where the defense of insanity is set up, and the degree of insanity of the accused which will justify an acquittal.
Alabama.â€”Insanity is a defense which must be proved to the satisfaction of the jury by that measure of proof which is required in civil cases, and a reasonable doubt of sanity raised by all the evidence does not authorize an acquittal. McAlister v. State, 17 Ala. 434 ; Boswell v. State, 63 Ala, 307; 35 Amer. Rep. 20.
Arkansas.â€”The accused setting up insanity as a defense must produce evidence sufficient to change the presumption of his sanity. McKenzie v. State, 36 Ark. 334.
California.â€”The accused must establish the defense of insanity by a preponderance of evidence, not merely by a doubt. People v. Myers, 20 Cal. 518; People v. Coffman, 34 Id. 233; People v. McDonell, 47 Id. 134; People v. Wilson, 49 Id. 13. This defense need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt; a mere preponderance of evidence is enough. People v. Wreden, 57 Cal. 130, 575; People v. Hamilton, 13 Reporter, 393. The evidence of insanity must be such that if the issue were submitted to a jury in a civil case they would find that the subject of the inquiry was insane. People v. Hamilton, 14 Reporter, 46.
Connecticut.â€”The burden of proving this defense (insanity) is on the accused, and it must be proved substantially as an independent fact. State v. Hoyt, 46 Conn. 330.
Delaware.â€”The burden of proof is on the prisoner, and he must prove his insanity beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Danby, 1 Houston Crim. Cas. 166; State v. Pratt, Id. 349; State v. Boice, Id. 355; State v. Thomas, Id. 511; State v. Draper, Id. 531.
Georgia.â€”The accused is presumed to be sane, and to acquit (it seems) the jury must be satisfied that he is not. Holsenbake v. State, 45 Ga. 43.
Illinois.â€”Every man is presumed to be sane until the contrary is shown. Eisher Â«. People, 33 111. 383. An accused setting up insanity as a defense does not thereby assume tire burden of proof. This defense is only a denial of one the essential allegations against him. If upon the whole evidence the jury entertain a reasonable doubt of the sanity of the accused, they must acquit. Hopps v. People, 31 Ill. 385. But the prosecution is not held to the proof of the sanity of the prisoner in any case. Chase v. People, 40 Ill. 352.
Indiana.â€”The jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the .defendantâ€™s mental capacity to commit the crime charged. The mind must be in such a reasonable condition as to be capable of giving a guilty character to the act. So far as a person acts under the influence of mental disease or of insane impulse controlling his will and his judgment, he is not guilty of a crime. Stevens v. State, 31 Ind. 485. The presumption is that a man is of Sound mind until there is evidence to the contrary. An accused is entitled to an acquittal if the evidence engenders a.reasonable doubt as to his mental capacity at the time of the commission of the act. Polk v. State 19 Ind. 170; Guetig v. State, 66 Id. 94.
Iowa.â€”The burden of proof is on the accused, and the jury must be reasonably satisfied, upon a consideration of the whole testimony, of the prisonerâ€™s insanity. State v. Felter, 32 Iowa, 49.
. Kansas.â€”Where the defense of insanity is set up it 'need not be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, but if there should be, upon the whole evidence together with the legal presumptions arsing therefrom, a reasonable doubt of the' defendantâ€™s sanity, the jury should acquit. Crawford v. State, 11 Kans. 32.
Kentucky:â€”The burden of proof is on the accused. There must be more than a mere doubt.raised as to the prisonerâ€™s sanity. The presumption of sanity must be overcome by a preponderance of proof in the prisonerâ€™s favor. , Kriel v. Commonwealth, 5 Bush. 362; Graham v. Commonwealth, 16 B. Monroe, 587. The true test is the knowledge of right and wrong and the power of the prisoner to control his actions. Smith v. Commonwealth, 1 Duvall, 224.
Louisiana.â€”The insanity must be clearly shown to the satisfaction of the jury, to have existed at the time of the commission of the act. People v. Coleman, 27 La. Ann. 691. The burden of proof, where temporary insanity is alleged, is on the- accused, and the insanity must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. De Rance (La.), 14 Reporter, 208.
Maine.â€”The burden is on the defendant to prove by a preponderance of evidence that he was laboring under such a defect of reason as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did, that he did not know he was doing wrong. State e. Lawrence, 57 Maine, 574.
Massachusetts.'â€”Insanity is no defense if the accused had sufficient capacity and reason to enable him to distinguish between right and wrong, to understand the nature character, and consequences of his act, and mental power sufficient to apply that knowledge to his own case. Commonwealth v. Rogers, 7 Metcalf, 500. The presumption of sanity exists until overcome by a preponderance of the whole evidence. Commonwealth v. Eddy, 7 Gray, 583; Commonwealth v. Heath, 11 Gray, 303.
Michigan,.â€”The prosecution may rest upon the presumption of the prisonerâ€™s sanity until evidence tending to overthrow it is produced. People v. Garbutt, 17 Mich. 9. The accused-is not guilty, if by reason of insanity he was not capable of knowing he was doing wrong, or if he had not power to resist the temptation to violate the law. People v. Finley, 38 Mich. 482.
Minnesota.â€”The burden of proof is on the defendant to show insanity. Bonfanti v.. State, 2 Minn. 123. And the insanity must be proved to the satisfaction of the court. - State v. Gut, 13 Minn. 341.'
' Mississippi.â€”Sanity is presumed in the absence of testimony relating thereto, but whenever the question is put in issue by evidence such as engenders a reasonable doubt, it devolves on the prosecution to remove it'and establish the sanity of the prisoner to the satisfaction of the jury beyond all reasonable doubt arising out of all the evidence in the case.
The degree of insanity must be such as to disqualify the accused for a proper perception of the difference between right and wrong.
A person is not punishable for an act committed under an uncontrollable impulse springing from mental disease existing to so high a degree that for the time it overwhelms reason, justice 'and conscience. A person is responsible for an act â€?committed under a mental condition in which the mind, perfectly perceiving the true relation of the party and recognizing all the obligations thereby imposed, is unable to control his will. Cunningham v. State, 56 Miss. 269.
Missouri.â€”The defense of insanity must be established to the satisfaction of the jury. Baldwin Â». State, 12 Mo. 223; State v. Smith, 53 Mo. 267. And the prisoner'is not entitled to the benefit of a mere doubt as to. his sanity. State v. Hunting, 21 Mo. 464; State Â«. McCoy, 34 Mo. 531; State y. Redemeier, 71 Mo. 173. The insanity which is a defense is a want of knowledge of the prisoner as to the nature and quality of the act, in that he was doing wrong. State v. Erb, 74 Mo. 199; State v. Kotovsky, 74 Id. 247. It is not necessary that the defense should be made out beyond a reasonable doubt; it is sufficient if the jury is reasonably satisfied by the weight or preponderance of the evidence that the prisoner was insane. State v. Klinger, 43 Mo. 127.
Nebraska.â€”Where evidence of insanity is produced by the prisoner, unless the jury are satisfied that the act complained of was not the product of mental disease, they must acquit.
But the degree of mental unsoundness must be such as to create an uncontrollable impulse to do the act charged.
If the accused has ability to distinguish right from wrong, he is responsible for his acts. Wright v. People, 4 Neb. 407; Hawe v. State, 11 Id. 537.
New Hampshire.â€”Where insanity is set up as a defense, the jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the soundness of the prisonerâ€™s mindhnd his capacity to commit the crime, upon all the evidence before them regard less of the fact whether it was adduced by the prosecution or by the defense. State v. Bartlett, 43 N. H. 224. If the prisoner had an irresistible impulse, the product of mental disease, which impelled him to commit the act, he is not responsible. State v. Jones, 50 N. H. 369.
New Jersey.â€”The test is, whether the accused was capable of distinguishing between right and wrong. The burden of proof is on the accused, and the proof of insanity ought to be as clear and satisfactory, in order to acquit, as the proof of committing the act ought to be in order to find a sane man guilty. State v. Spear, 21 N. J. L. (1 Zab.) 201.
North Carolina.â€”Every one is presumed to be of sound mind till the contrary is found. On questions of sanity the doctrine of reasonable doubt does not apply, but he who alleges insanity must prove it as other material allegations are proved. State v. Starling, 6 Jones, 366. The defense of insanity must be established to the satisfaction of the jury. State v. Payne, 86 N. C. 609.
Ohio.â€”The test is whether the prisoner ' has sufficient reason and capacity to distinguish between right and wrong, and to understand the nature of the act and his relation to the party injured. The burden of establishing insanity is on the prisoner. It is sufficient if the jury be reasonably satisfied by the weight or the preponderance of the evidence that the accused was insane. Loeffner v. State, 10 Ohio, 599. A bare preponderance in favor of the prisoner is all that is necessary. Bond v. State, 23 Ohio, 349; Bergen v. State, 31 Ohio, 111.
Pennsylvania.-â€”A reasonable doubt of the fact of insanity is not enough. The evidence must be satisfactory, not merely doubtful. Insanity as a defense must be so great as to control the will, and take away the freedom of moral, action. Ortwein v. Commonwealth,. 76 Penn. 414; Lynch v. Commonwealth, 77 Id. 205. It is necessary that the jury should be satisfied of the insanity of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, but there must be proof that is satisfactory, such as flows fairly from a preponderance of evidence. Meyers i>. Commonwealth, 83 Penn. 131; Pannell v. Commonwealth, 86 Id. 260; Sayres v. Commonwealth, 88 Id. 291.
Tennessee.â€”The presumption is that the accused is sane, and the bur- . den is on the accused to prove the contrary. The test of -responsibility is, whether the accused was capable at the time of the ofÃ­ense of distinguishing between good and evil, and had a consciousness of doing wrong. Dove v. State, 3 Heiskell, 348.
Texas.â€”The accused is presumed to be sane until the contrary is proven. The test of responsibility is the capacity of distinguishing between right and wrong, and, in cases of partial insanity, whether the accused was capable of distinguishing right from wrong in the particular connection in which the unlawful act- was done. Carter n. State, 12 Tex. 500; Clark v. State, 8 Tex. App. 350. The evidence of insanity must be such as to satisfy the minds and consciences of the jury to the extent that they can say the accused is, and should be acquitted on that ground. Johnson v. State, 10 Tex. App. 571.
Virginia.â€”Insanity as a defense must be proved upon the whole evidence to the satisfaction of the jury. Boswell v. Commonwealth, 20 Gratt. 860; Dejarnette v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. 867.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164445,MATTER OF RAMSCAR,1882-06,"Lawrence, J.
â€”The prisoner was brought before me on the 7th inst., upon a writ of habeas corpus, and a certiorari in aid thereof, and his discharge from custody was urged by his counsel on the ground that, upon the face of the commitment issued by the coroner, and which was returned by the warden of the city prison as his authority for the prisoners detention, no crime appeared to have been committed by him, or was charged in said commitment.
I overruled the objections which were taken to the commitment, and held that, though perhaps irregular, sufficient was disclosed upon the face thereof to warrant his detention, and, upon the consent of the two assistants of the district attorney, the amount of bail in which the prisoner was held was reduced to $2,000, and an examination directed to be held before Police Justice Bixby. The learned district attorney now moves to resettle the order mads by him, by striking out therefrom the direction as to the examination, and claims that the prisoner is not entitled to such examination.
Having given to the case as full consideration as the demands upon my time in other cases have permitted, I am confirmed in the opinion heretofore expressed, that the prisoner is entitled to an examination before a magistrate, under the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which have not, so far as 1 am aware, ever been judicially construed. Section 778. of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the testimony of the witnesses examined before the coronerâ€™s jury must be reduced to writing by the coroner or under his direction, and must be forthwith filed by him, with the inquisition, in the office of the clerk of the court of sessions of the county, or of a city court having power to inquire into the tlie offense by the intervention of a grand jury. Section 779 provides that if, however, the defendant be arrested before the inquisition can be filed, the coroner must deliver it, with the testimony, to the magistrate before whom the defendant is brought, as provided in section 781, who must return it with the depositions and statement taken before him in the manner prescribed in section 221. Section 780 provides that if the jury find that a person was killed or wounded by another, under circumstances not excusable or justified by law, or that his death was occasioned by the act of another by criminal means, and the party committing the act be ascertained by the inquisition and be not in custody, the coroner must issue a warrant, signed by him with his name of office, into one or more counties as may be necessary for the arrest of the person charged. Section 781 prescribes the form of warrant to be issued in stich case, and by that warrant the sheriff, constable, marshal or policeman to whom it is directed is commanded to arrest the person charged, and take him before the nearest magistrate in this county.
Section 782 provides that the coronerâ€™s warrant may be served in any county, and the officer serving it must proceed thereon in all respects as upon a warrant of arrest on an information, except- that when served in another -county, it need not be indorsed by a magistrate of that county. Section 783 provides that the magistrate, when the defendant is brought before him, must proceed to examine the charge contained in the inquisition, and hold the defendant to answer, or discharge him therefrom in the same manner in all respects as upon a warrant of arrest on an information. Section 784 provides that upon the arrest of the defendant, the clerk with whom the inquisition is filed must, without delay, furnish the magistrate a certified copy of it and of the testimony returned therewith.
Taking all these sections together, I think it quite clear that the defendant against whom an inquisition has been found by a coronerâ€™s jury is entitled to a hearing before a magistrate, whether he has been arrested before the inquisition has been â– filed or is arrested after such filing.
It will be perceived that under section 779, if the defendant be arrested before the inquisition can be filed, the coroner must deliver it with the testimony to the magistrate before whom the defendant is brought, as provided in section 781, who must return it with the depositions and statement taken before him, in the manner prescribed in section 221. Section 221 provides that when the magistrate has discharged the defendant or has held him to answer, as provided in sections 207 and 208, he must return to the next court of oyer and terminer of court of sessions of the county, or city court having power to inquire into the offense by the intervention of a grand jury, at or before its opening, the warrant, if any, the depositions, the statement of the defendant, if he has made one, and all undertakings of bail or for the appearance of witnesses taken by him. This certainly contemplates an examination of a defendant after the finding of the inquisition of the coronerâ€™s jury, because section. 781 is the section which prescribes the form of the warrant to be issued by the coroner. Section 783 provides that when the defendant is brought before the magistrate, after an arrest under such a warrant, the magistrate must proceed to examine the charge contained in the inquisition, and hold the defendant to answer or discharge him therefrom in the same manner in all respects as upon a warrant of arrest on an information. An information is defined as follows: â€?The information is the allegation made to a magistrate that a person has been guilty of some designated crime.â€?Code Crim. Pro. Â§ 145. And the proceedings to be taken after he has been arrested on such an information are contained in chapter 7 of title 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, sections 188 to 221 inclusive.. It seems therefore to follow, under the provisions of section 779, that in the case of a defendant who has been arrested before the inquisition can be filed, the prisoner is entitled to be examined before a magistrate, before whom he may be brought as provided in section 781, and that in the case of a prisoner who has not been arrested until after the inquisition was filed under sections 781 and 783, the defendant is entitled to be heard before a magistrate in all respects as upon a warrant of arrest on an information. This view I think is strengthened by a reference to section 784, which provides, as we have seen, that after the defendant has been arrested the clerk with whom the inquisition is filed must, without delay, furnish to the magistrate a certified copy of it and- of the testimony returned therewith. And section 784 is entirely in harmony with the provisions of section 778, directing the testimony of the witnesses-examined before the coroner to be forthwith filed by him with the inquisition, in the office of the clerk of the court of -sessions of the county, or of a city court having power to inquire into the offense by the intervention of a grand jury. In other words, in my opinion, the clerk referred to in section 784 who is to furnish the magistrate with a certified copy of the inquisition and testimony is the clerk referred to in section 778, with whom the inquisitibn and testimony are directed to be filed by the coroner. This interpretation of the statute seems to me to harmonize all the various sections to which I have referred, and to make them consistent with each other and consistent with what is deemed by me to have been the design of the legislatureâ€?that a person against whom an inquisition has been found by a coronerâ€™s jury, whether arrested before or after the filing of such inquisition, is entitled to a hearing before a magistrate, in the same manner as if he had been arrested upon an ordinary information as defined by section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
If this is not so, what becomes of section 779, directing the coroner to deliver the testimony to the magistrate, if the defendant has been arrested before the inquisition can be filed, and of the provisions of section 781 and 783, providing for a hearing before a magistrate, on an arrest after an inquisition has been found and filed ? And, furthermore, what becomes of the provisions of section 784, requiring a certified copy of the inquisition and testimony to be furnished to the magistrate where the warrant of the coroner has been executed after the inquisition found ? My examination of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, above referred to, has led me to the conviction that it was the intention of the legislature, that in every case a prisoner should have an opportunity of being heard before one of the magistrates of the county in which he was apprehended, or in which the crime with which he stands charged is alleged to have been committed. And I am strengthened in this conviction from the fact that in the case of People v. Collins, 20 How. Pr. 111, it was held by Mr. Justice Balcom, that on an inquest before a coronerâ€™s jury, the coroner had no power to take testimony to establish the innocence of the prisoner, nor had the prisoner the right to cross-examine the witnesses produced before the coroner. It is said, however, on the part of the people, that the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure to which I have adverted have been materially changed by chapter 465 of the Laws of 1881, page 627, which is â€?An act entitled an act to amend chapter 256 of the Laws of 1878,â€?entitled â€?An act relating to the coroners of the city and county of Mew York, their duties and compensation,â€?passed June 6, 1881. Section 2 of that act provides: â€œThe same act is hereby amended by adding thereto the following sections, to be known as sections 7 and 8 respectively:
â€?Section 7. Each of the coroners of the city and county of Mew York shall file with the clerk of the board of coroners in all cases that may come before him, an abstract of the testimony taken by him, and a copy of the verdict rendered by the jury, and the clerk of said board shall keep the same on file until it is turned over to the Board of Health, and a receipt taken therefor, except in the case of a homicide, in which case he shall transmit the same without delay to the district attorney of the city and county of Mew York.â€?It is not claimed that section 8, added by the act in question to the act of 1878, has any bearing upon the point now under consideration. But it is claimed that section 7, which I have just recited, was intended â€œto create an exception in the city of New York as to eoroners therein, and practically to reaffirm the local New York statute as to coroners, by continuing them as' magistrates, giving them the power to hold examinations', and providing, in eases of homicide, that such examination should be transmitted, like those of any other magistrate, to the district attorney for the action of the grand jury;â€?and it is maintained that, as by section 963 of the Code of Criminal Procedureâ€”that when the Code is construed in connection with other statutes it must be deemed to have been enacted on January 4, 1881, so that any statute enacted after that day is to have the same effect as- if it had been enacted after this Code. The act of 1881 changes the, general provisions of that Code, and in substance repeals certain provisions of them as to the city and county of New York.
If I found any inconsistency between the provisions of the Code and the act of 1881, I might give my assent to this contention. But there is no such inconsistency. The provisions of sections 778, 779 and 784 of. the Code are quite consistent with the provisions of the second section of the act of 1881. Construed together, they seem to me to mean that, in addition to filling the inquisition and testimony with the clerk of the Court of Sessions, &c., and in addition to furnishing a certified copy thereof to the magistrate in cases of homicide, the coroner shall transmit an abstract of the testimony taken by him and a copy of the verdict rendered by the jury to the district attorney. I can discover in the act of 1881 no intention on the part of the legislature to subvert the entire scheme of the statute in relation to proceedings against those charged by a coronerâ€™s jury with the commission of a mime.
I do discover in the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure an intention on the part of the legislature to give to persons thus charged an opportunity to be heard, whether arrested before or after an inquisition filed or found in the same manner in all respects as upon a warrant of arrest on an information. See Code, sections 783, 779, 784 and 145, and sections 188 to 221 inclusive. I am not prepared to say that the intention of the legislature has been declared to be changed or altered by the statute to which I have been referred.
If the foregoing views are correct, it is the right of the prisoner to be heard before a magistrate as upon a warrant of arrest on an information. When the order which is now sought to be modified or set aside was made, it was assented that the hearing should be had before a magistrate designated in the order. If that assent is withdrawn, the order will be that the prisoner is entitled to a hearing before one of the magistrates of this county. If it is not withdrawn the order will stand as heretofore entered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164487,PEOPLE v. MELIUS,1882-11,"The charge to the jury was as follows:
Noah Davis, J.
-â€”In this case there are some material and .important facts about which there is no controversy whatever. The train on which the person named in the indictment, Mr. Wagner, was riding at the time he was killed, was an express train of thirteen carsâ€”all, or nearly all, parlor carsâ€”containing a very large number of passengers; and it had, as it seems, but two brakemen and a conductor in general charge of the train. It was a little late, and had reached a point near Spuyten Duyvil and below the cut, where it was suddenly stopped: The cause of the stoppage was not material, especially to the issue here. It may have been caused by some wrong act of some one of the passengers ; and from what appears here, it probably was. If that person was upon trial here, then of course the cause of the stoppage would be inquired into. The loss of life was a result of that unlawful act, and the person should be liable for the consequences of his wrongful act. But that is not before us here. The train was stopped in a most dangerous place for a train to be delayed. It was stopped upon the track upon which there was following at some distance another train. The cause of the stoppage was of such a character that the train could not be readily started, and the persons who were on the train as passengers were therefore exposed to serious danger. The train being at a stop, certain duties were immediately devolved upon the conductor and the brakeman, and especially upon the rear brakeman. The duty was more or less imperative. If the written rules had forbid him to take any steps to warn the approaching trainâ€”and yet it was his duty to do soâ€?you all would say it was culpable negligence towards his passengers in not doing what was a necessity to save the lives of the passengers, The written or printed rules place the rear brakeman under the conductorâ€™s general direction, while they provide special duty which is to be performed, that nevertheless make him subject to the general control of the conductor. The rule does not provide that the conductor was to send the brakeman of the rear car. He may send any one if the. necessity exists. This must always be done; lie must send somebody by the rule; the conductor will be held strictly responsible for the prompt investigation of the stoppage. It was his duty to send somebody back, and if this had been done the accident would not have happened. The train stopped several hundred feet from the cut, and was immediately in the way of the approaching Tarrytown train. If the rules had been observed the train would have been stopped. If a man had been sent back,â€”and there was plenty of time to do this,â€”then the accident would have been avoided. Under the rule the rear brakeman is enjoined to go instantly at the time the train stops. The conductor has said that he had specially told the rear brakeman in this ease to go back immediately whenever, the train should stop. There was no necessity of the conductor going back and giving orders every time the danger arose; and when a stoppage occurred at this place it would be something that would be quite superfluous for the brakeman to wait for orders from the conductor. The brakeman had no right to say, I will take all the chances. His duty would be to seize his lights and immediately go back. With several hundred lives exposed, common sense would say that the first thing a man would do would be to go back to a point far enough to stop the downcoming train.
On the part of the defense it is claimed that the conductor, in March, 1881, gave the brakeman general instructions not to go from the train so far, without special direction, but that he conld catch it if it started on. Such instruction as that, if it were given, would have been in express violation of these rules. The question is therefore presented to you whether these instructions were given. The defendantâ€™s duty may be in some cases, as between himself and the company, controlled by written rules; but even where there are written rules, in such case, it would be, as between the employee and the company, his sufficient excuse for obeying them, although obedience to them was not a protection to the passengers; but when the question arises as to the obligation to perform a duty towards the passengers, and save their lives from exposure or danger, then, if the written rules were of a character which restrained him froth doing something which ought to have been done and is required by law to be done, the written rules would scarcely be protection when the people charged -him with culpable negligence. To make myself more clearly understood, if a written rule had forbidden him taking any steps to go back and signal the approaching train, it was still his obvious duty to to do so to save the lives of passengers, and the law would say it was culpable negligence not to do what -was an apparent necessity to save the lives of passengers. The law requires the exercise of that degree of care and vigilance which the character of the impending danger demands. A manâ€™s duty is always measured by that standard. If there be neglect of duty under circumstances where a jury can say such negligence was wrongful, to use the language of the statute, then it becomes a crime, if in consequence of that wrongful negligence some human being is killed.
The jury returned a verdict of not guilty.
Note.â€”In an important English case, decided in 1848, the court went even further than Judge Davis in this case, in holding an employee of a railroad company responsible for negligence.
In the case referred to (Reg. Â®. Pargeter), the defendant was tried upon an indictment for manslaughter by neglect to give a proper signal to denote the obstruction of a line of railway, whereby a collision took place and a passenger was killed. It was proved that the prisoner had other duties besides attending to the signals, some of .them being incompatible with his duty there. This was held to he no excuse for the defendantâ€™s failing to give the signal. Reg. v. Pargeter, 3 Cox Crim.

1164460,BERRY v. PEOPLE,1878-10,"The following opinion was delivered at General Term.
By the Court.â€”Ingalls, J.
â€”The plaintiff in error was com victed of the misdemeanor of keeping a disorderly house. Upon the trial, a great number of witnesses were examined, who differed widely in their statement of facts. The testimony, adduced in support of the prosecution, established the offense charged in the indictment, by showing that the' Opera House, so called, had been so conducted by the prisoner that it became very disreputable, the conduct of the inmates being grossly indecent, and calculated to. corrupt the morals of all who visited the house as a place of amusement, and by the noises and tumult created therein, disturbed the peace and quiet of the community. The evidence, on the part of the prisoner, was in conflict with that adduced by the people, and wholly irreconcilable therewith. It was the province of the jury, to settle the disputed question of fact, which they have done, in favor of the prosecution, and their verdict is not so far unsupported by evidence, as to justify a reversal upon that ground.
The plaintiff in error insisted upon certain exceptions, taken during the progress of the trial, which we will proceed to consider. Ho error was committed in excluding the inquiry addressed to the witness, Meeker, as to whether he had acted in the capacity of informer in other states. 1st. This inquiry was collateral to the main question involved in the trial, and hence it was discretionary with the court, how far it should be indulged. G. W. T. P. Co. v. Loomis, 32 N. Y. 127; La Beau v. People, 6 Parker, 371; 34 N. Y. 223. 2nd. The examination allowed upon that subject, sufficiently presented the attitude of the witness in that respect, and the prisoner had the benefit thereof before the jury. The law does not compel the court to go so far in allowing such examination, as, in effect, to transfer the trial from the prisoner to the witness. The only legitimate purpose of such an inquiry, in regard to a witness, is to exhibit his character fairly to the jury, so that they may place a proper estimate upon his testimony. Error was not perpetrated by allowing the witness, Ada M. Travers, who resided in the immediate vicinity of the Opera House, to testify in regard to the disturbance,, occasioned by the noises in such house, as that wras one of the elements involved in the inquiry, whether the prisoner kept a disorderly house, and such evidence bore upon that question. The nature and extent of the examination upon that subject, must necessarily be left, in a great measure, to the discretion of the court, and nothing short of a clear abuse of such discretion, should induce the appellate court to interfere. People v. Carey, 4 Park. 238.
The same reasoning applies to the exception taken to the ruling of the court, in allowing the evidence of Joseph S. Bust, upon the same subject. The case of the prisoner could not have been prejudiced by the ruling of the court, refusing to allow the witness, Thomas J. Kennedy, to answer whether he saw anything indecent or improper in the performance which he witnessed. He was allowed to state fully all that he did see or hear. And he stated that he saw nothing wrong. Certainly, it was not necessary for him to repeat his evidence in a more objectionable form. The same view may be taken of the decision, in regard to the witness Ely.
The printed rules and regulations, which were posted in the house, were properly excluded. The prisoner was not tried for a violation of his profession, but for wrongful acts performed in his house, either in his presence, or by his procurement. Such rules could be of no account, unless observed, and, if they have been, there could be no ground of complaint.
The refusal to allow the witness Barnard to testify that he had witnessed the plays â€œHock Modestyâ€?and â€œSilken Meshes â€?at other theaters was not error. . 1st. The witness was allowed to describe all that he discovered at the opera house in question. 2d. If such plays were presented at other places in a manner equally objectionable, and tolerated, it could not excuse the prisoner, or palliate his offence.
The refusal to strike out the answer of the witness Kraft, in which he characterized the noises which he heard â€?as infernal,â€?when taken in connection with the description which he subsequently gave of them, could not have prejudiced the prisoner. Even an erroneous ruling does not call for a reversal, when the. court can perceive that no injury resulted from it.
The decision of the court in regard to the form and sufficiency of the indictment, assailed as it was for the first time upon the trial, can be sustained. Case y. People, 21 Hun, 504, and cases there cited ; Rex v. Mathews, 5 T. R. 162; People v. Conger, 1 Wheeler, 448. The court properly refused to charge at the request of the prisonerâ€™s counsel the following proposition: 2d. â€?The granting of the license to give theatrical entertainments as provided by law by the mayor, the payment and acceptance of the additional license fee to the House of Refuge, coupled with the evidence of John D. Hardy, the clerk to the mayor, that no complaint has ever been made against the defendantâ€™s government of the premises referred to in the testimony, since the granting of such license, nor any objections presented to its continuance, jyt'ima fade, is evidence that the defendant kept and maintained a morally proper and well-governed house.â€?The granting of such license could establish nothing in regard to the question triedâ€”whether the house was rendered disorderly by the noisy and indecent conduct of the inmates of the establishment. The prisoner was not indicted and tried for keeping such house without a license, but rather for keeping a house which was rendered disorderly by base conduct, even though licensed to maintain an opera house. Again, the court gave the prisoner all the benefit of a license in the following intimation to the jury: â€œI charge you, gentlemen, as the law controlling your government, the third proposition requested by the counsel for the accused, as follows: 3d. â€?The keeping and maintaining a house for theatrical exhibitions and entertainments is a legitimate and proper business and pursuit; and when kept and maintained in .pursuance of the license required by law, is presumed to be an orderly and well governed house, and such presumption can only be destroyed by the most conclusive proof to the contrary.â€?bio error was committed by refusing to charge the following proposition at the request of the counsel of the prisoner : 4th. â€?Where an indictment charges that a place of licensed resort, an entertainment is kept in a disorderly and ill-governed manner, to the common nuisance of the people of the State of blew York, and citizens in that neighborhood residing, the evidence must show conclusively that such place is a common, continuing and general nuisance to the neighborhood in which it is situated, and the citizens generally therein resident. Proof that certain of the neighbors only, were disturbed by noises and acts emanating from such place, would constitute merely a private nuisance, and not a public one, and would, therefore, not be punishable criminally.â€?Barnesciotta v. People, 10 Hun, 137; Jacobowsky v. People, 6 Id. 524.
The court properly declined to charge the following. 5th. â€?The mere noises and outcries incident to the usual performances of plays, in a place of theatrical entertainment, duly licensed, coupled with the noises incident to the applause of the audience, are not matters in themselves sufficient to constitute a public nuisance, such matters being the legitimate and ordinary attendants upon theatrical entertainments, and if any persons, residing adjacent to such place, are disturbed and annoyed by reason thereof, the proper remedy would be in a court of equity, by injunction, and not in a criminal court, by indictment.â€?It seems to us, that the third proposition, wlii'ch was charged as requested by the prisonerâ€™s counsel, embraced all that the defense could properly claim under this request. The court could not be required to repeat or to charge propositions which were merely speculative.
The following requests were properly disposed of.
6th. â€?The evidence of the two witnesses, Meeker and Waite, shows them not only to be participants in, but promoters of the alleged immoral acts, testified to, by them; they are, therefore, in the eye of the law, accomplices, and the jury should require their evidence to be corroborated in all material particulars, before they accord to it credit and belief.â€?7th. â€œIn addition to the relation of the witnesses, Meeker and Waite, as accomplices, the fact that they were the hired agents of the society instigating this prosecution, and paid for the procurement of the evidence which they testify to, having, in great measure, themselves created, are matters which go strongly to the credibility of each of them, and the jury should weigh their evidence with great care, and even suspicion.â€?It will be observed that the court qualified his refusal to charge as requested.
The following, proposition of the prisonerâ€™s counsel, was properly refused by the court:
8th. â€?The fact that the society instigating this prosecution, did not proceed, by way of complaint, before the judicial officers mentioned in the act of 1836, to revoke the license of defendant, and thus, perforce, abate what they alleged to be a public nuisance, is a circumstance to be taken into consideration by the jury, against the prosecution.â€?The court charged, as requested by the prisonerâ€™s counsel, the following:
9th. â€œIf the jury, from the majority;of the neighbors who have testified, and from, the evidence of .the numerous police officers, who, in their official and individual relations, visited the place, charged to he a common nuisance, in the indictment, find that it was free from disturbances, disorders and other incidents of ill government, and do not find the evidence as to immoral acts, given by the witnesses, Meeker and Waite, fully corroborated, they should acquit the defendant.â€?10th. â€?Even if tire acts and conversations, testified to by Meeker and Waite, were, in reality, recitals of truth, and the â–?jury fully believed them, the defendant can, in no manner, be held responsible for their occurrence and utterance, unless the evidence clearly shows that he knew of, and consented thereto ; and, if the jury have a reasonable doubt that he did so know and consent, then he is to be acquitted of all blame, by reason thereof.â€?The court properly refused to charge the eleventh proposition, as requested by the counsel for the prisoner.
The twelfth proposition was charged as requested.
In determining whether the court erred in the instructions to the jury, or by refusing to charge as requested, the entire charge must be examined and considered, with a view to ascertain whether the plaintiff in error has any substantial ground of complaint.
In regard to the exception taken to the remarks of the court to the jury, after they returned for further instructions, it is sufficient to say that the exception was too general to avail the prisoner, as it can hardly be pretended, that no portion of such remarks were proper. We discover no error which will justify a reversal of the judgment, or the granting of a new trial, and the conviction must be affirmed.

1164486,BERRY v. PEOPLE,1879-04,"Per Curiam.
â€”We have examined the various questions presented on the trial, and so far as they present reviewable questions of law, we concur with the opinion of Ingalls, J., delivered at the General Term.
The refusal to charge the requests, in respect to the credibility of the two detectives, or informers, was not error, for the reason that one of the requests was to charge that they were accomplices, and the other assumed that they were such. Commonwealth v. Downing, 4 Gray, 29. We agree with the counsel for the prisoner, that the testimony of such witnesses should be viewed with caution, and even distrust; but it is, after all, a question for the jury, whether they shall be believed.
The judge submitted that question to the jury, and whether his comments were just or not, they are not reviewable, and no exception was taken to them.
The exception to the closing remarks of the judge, urging an agreement, is not tenable, for the reason stated in the opinion. We cannot think that these remarks are capable of so harsh a construction, as the counsel for the prisoner gives to them. The alleged threat to lock up the jurors, if they failed to agree, was, we think, only intended as a statement that the jury would have to remain over night, as the court would adjourn. Nothing like a threat of imprisonment or punishment could have been intended.
The judgment must be affirmed.

â€”In this case, it would appear that the prisoner, having been convicted of disorderly conduct, could not be sentenced to give security to keep the peace, in addition to being adjudged to pay a fine and stand imprisoned in the meantime.

1164437,MATTER OF McMAHON,1883-01,"Lawrence, J.
â€”The prisoner was brought before me, on a writ of habeas corpus, and her discharge asked for on the ground that it appears from the commitment, that having been convicted of disorderly conduct she was ordered to find surety, in the sum of three hundred dollars, for her good behavior for the term of one month, and that having failed to find such surety, she was committed to the city prison, for the term of one month.
It is urged that, under the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the police justices are deprived of the power which it is conceded they possessed under the former statutes, to order persons convicted of disorderly conduct to find surety for their good behavior for a period not exceeding twelve months, and to stand committed for a period not exceeding twelve months, in default of giving such surety.
The question involved is a serious one, as a large number of the summary convictions in this city are in cases of disorderly conduct. Upon examining the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Penal Code, I have been unable to find any allusion in either Code to the offense of disorderly conduct. Counsel conceded on the argument that they had been ' similarly unsuccessful. Prior to the passage of the Codes there were three classes of persons who might under the law be summarily convicted before a magistrate without a juryâ€”to wit, first, vagrants; second, disorderly persons; third, persons guilty of disorderly conduct. The distinction between these different offenses and the difference in the mode of procedure for their punishment under the Â¡Revised Statutes and the act of 1833 (Laws of 1833, p. 9. ch. 11), the act of 1859 (ch: 491, p. 1129), and the act of 1860 (ch. 508, p. 1013), and other acts upon the samo subject, was most clearly pointed out and explained by Chief Justice Daly, in his elaborate and exhaustive opinion in the case of the Twelve Commitments (19 Abb. Pr. 394,396, 397, 400), and it would be unnecessary, if it were possible, to add anything to what the learned justice there says in regard to those offenses.
I have said that there is no direct mention of the offense of disorderly conduct either in the Penal Code or in the Code of Criminal Procedure. But .persons who come under the head of vagrants and disorderly persons are distinctly referred to in each of the Codes. Section 887 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which consists of eight subdivisions, declares who shall be considered as vagrants. This section is contained in title 6 of part 6 of that Code, and the remaining sections of that title provide for the apprehension, conviction and punishment of vagrants.
By section 291 of the Penal Code, certain acts or conduct on the part of children render them liable to be arrested and dealt with as vagrants, and by section 724 it is provided that this Code shall not affect any of the provisions of law relating to apprentices, bastards, disorderly persons, Indians and vagrants, except so far as any provisions therein are inconsistent with this Code. So, too, those who are disorderly persons are defined by section 899 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This section contains more different subdivisions, but none of them refer to disorderly conduct. This section is in title 7 of part 6, and the remaining sections of the title prescribe the manner of apprehending and punishing such offenders. And as we have already seen, by section 724 of the Penal Code, the provisions of law in relation to disorderly persons, except where inconsistent with that Code, are not affected thereby. The particular ground upon which the prisonerâ€™s discharge is asked for is that by section 99 of the Code of Criminal Procedure it is provided that â€?security to keep the peace or be of good behavior cannot be required, except as prescribed in this chapter.â€?Standing alone this language is most comprehensive, and if it is to be taken literally, or if there are no other provisions in either of the Codes which must be considered in its interpretation, it would necessarily follow that, even the offense of disorderly conduct still exists, the police justice, on a conviction for such offense, would have no authority to order the prisoner to give security for good behavior. In the case of Davis, which was before me a few weeks ago, the point was raised, but, not fully argued, and, after such examination as I was then enabled to give it, I formed the impression that the objection should be sustained. As I have since learned that the question is of a very serious character, I have desired a test case to be brought, in order that I might, with the assistance of counsel, re-examine and review the matter, so that if anything had escaped me, or the counsel, on the former argument, and the result then arrived at was for that reason erroneous, the error might be corrected.
It is argued in favor of the validity of the commitment, that section 99 is not to be interpreted literally, nor without ref- * erence to other provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Penal Code, and it is said that that section should be construed as referring only to the crimes which are the subject of the part which contains the title in which that section is to be found.
The Code of Criminal Procedure is divided into six parts. The first relates to the courts having original jurisdiction in criminal actions, the second relates to the prevention of crime, the third relates to the judicial proceedings for the removal of public officers by impeachment or otherwise, the fourth relates to the proceedings in criminal actions prosecuted by indictment, the fifth relates to proceedings in the Special Sessions and Police Courts,- and the sixth to special proceedings of a criminal nature. Section 99 is in that part of the Code which relates ""to the prevention of crime, and it is argued that when the statute says that security to keep the peace, or to be of good behavior, cannot be required except as prescribed in this chapter, it means security to keep the peace and to be of good behavior as to the crimes specified in that chapter.
The point is not free from doubt, but after much deliberation I have satisfied myself that it must be sustained for several reasons.
In the first place there is at least one section of the Code of Criminal Procedure which expressly authorizes a magistrate to require an â€?offender to give security to be of good behavior. By section 901, if a.magistrate convicts one of being a disorderly person lie may require that the person charged give security by a written undertaking, with one or more sureties; thatâ€?First. If he be a person described in the first or second subdivisions of section 899 he will support his wife and children and will indemnify the county, city, village or town, against their becoming within one year chargeable upon the public.
Second. In all other cases, that he will be of good behavior for the space of one year. This section is contained in the title of the Code of Criminal Procedure which relates to disorderly persons ; the first and second subdivisions relate to persons who have abandoned their wives or children, or who threaten to run away and leave them, and the remaining seven subdivisions to the numerous other persons who are declared to be disorderly. Again, by section 64 of the, Code of Criminal Procedure, which is contained in part 1, relating to courts having original jurisdiction in criminal actions, it is provided that the Court of Special Sessions in the city and county of Hew York, has jurisdiction .... (sub. 6): â€?To require the principal in a recognizance to appear at the court and enter into a further recognizance to keep the peace or to be of good behavior, or both, toward the people of the State for a period not exceeding one year, and on default thereof to commit him to prison till he be discharged therefrom according to law.â€?The statute is silent as to the officers by whom, or the offenses for which, the recognizances therein referred to' may have been taken; but it is claimed by the police justices, and I think correctly, that this section recognizes the fact that under chap. 508 of the Laws of 1860, they had the power to take recognizances for good behavior and to keep the peace, which recognizances were required to be forthwith filed in the office of the clerk of the Court of Special Sessions (Laws of 1860, p. 1007).
Furthermore, by section 74 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, â€?Police justices have such jurisdiction, and such only, as is specially conferred upon them by statute. The courts held by police justices are called police courts, and Courts of Special Sessions are also called police courts and are so designated in different parts of the Code.â€?This provision is contained in chap. 4 of title 6 of part 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Upon turning to the other titles and chapters of this part, it will be found that the jurisdiction of all the other courts is specifically defined. . But the police justices are to have such jurisdiction, and such only, as isâ€”not as may beâ€?specially conferred upon them by statute. I have not been able to find any other declaration in either of the Codes as to the jurisdiction of the police justices, and it would seem therefore to be a reasonable conclusion that the Legislature intended by the above section to preserve the jurisdiction of those magistrates as it existed before the adoption of the Codes. There is another circumstance which should not be lost sight of in determining the question which is now under consideration. It was the intention of the codifiers that both of the Codes should go into effect at the same time. The Legislature determined otherwise; but in each statute a provision was inserted that, when construed in connection with other statutes, each should be deemed to have been passed on the 4th day of January, 1881. Code Crim. Proc. Â§ 963 ; Penal Code, Â§ 727.
I have already pointed out that in neither of .the Codes is disorderly conduct mentioned. It is well known that in this city cases of disorderly conduct constitute a large portion of the matters which come before the police magistrates. Could it have been the intention of the Legislature to have allowed that class of offenders to go free, or in other words, to say, that persons who would formerly have been adjudged guilty of disorderly conduct, in the future should be considered guiltless? Such a result is not to be reached in construing the Codes, unless it is unavoidable, and if we take the Codes together it is not unavoidable.
Section 724 of the Penal Code, as I have before observed, preserves the statutes in regard to vagrants and disorderly persons, except so far as their provisions may be inconsistent with the Code. Now by the next section (725), it is provided that â€?Nothing in this Code affects any of the provisions of the following statutes, but such statutes are recognized as continuing in force notwithstanding the provisions of the Code, except so far as they have been repealed or affected by subsequent laws.â€?Fourth. â€œAll acts defining or providing fol' the punishment of offenses, and not defined and made punishable by this code.â€?Section 726 repeals all acts, and parts of acts, which are inconsistent with the provisions of this act, &c.
And by section 962 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it is provided that â€?this Code applies to criminal actions, and all other proceedings in criminal cases, which are herein provided for,â€?&c.
Inasmuch as in neither of the Codes are cases of disorderly conduct provided for, the conclusion is irresistible that the acts defining that offense are not inconsistent with either Code, and that they are therefore retained.
Finally, I cannot presume that the Legislature intended to abolish disorderly conduct from the statute book as an offense, and while the omission to refer in either Code to that offence is peculiar, it seems to me that the sections of the two Codes to which I referred, save the prior statutes relating thereto.
The writ is therefore dismissed, and the prisoner remanded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164476,PEOPLE v. COURTNEY,1883-01,"Brady, J.
The defendant was indicted in the Court of General Sessions of the City and County of Hew York,.for the crime of forgery in the third degree. He was tried and convicted, and sentenced to five yearsâ€?imprisonment in the State Prison. The main witness on behalf of the people was an accomplice, and it is insisted on behalf of the appellant that there was no corroboration of his evidence such as is contemplated by section 399 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as amended by chapter 360 of the Laws of 1882, and which is in the following language, namely: â€?A conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice, unless he be corroborated by such other evidence as tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime.â€?It was conceded upon the trial that the check was a forgery, and the following is the statement made by the respondentâ€™s counsel, of the evidence on the part of the prosecution given by the accomplice. It is accepted as correct for the purpose of discussing the question to be considered.
Barton, the accomplice, testifies that he knew defendant since January last. That on May 16, or four days before check in question was given to him by Courtney, he opened an account in the Pacific Bank under the fictitious name of Horton, depositing therein the sum of $200, and that Courtney furnished him the money, suggested the fictitious name, and directed him to open the account about noon on May 16. He met Courtney by appointment at Canal street and the Bowery, Courtney having stated to him that he expected to get a check on that day.
At this meeting, Oourtney told him he had not yet got the check for himâ€”to return in a half hour. A half hour later, he met Courtney on Canal street near the Bowery. They met under an awning ; Courtney took the check in question out of his pocket, handed it to him, and directed him to give it to a boy (Albert Woodman) who was waiting at Earleâ€™s Hotel, and have him get it certified at the Marine Bank."" He gave the check to the boy, and Courtney followed to see that the boy took it to the bank. The boy returned the certified check to him, Courtney following the boy. He and the boy went and deposited the certified cheek in the Pacific Bank, after which he returned and met Courtney at the corner of Center and Bowery. By direction of Courtney, he afterwards drew by checks $2,170 in all, which he paid over to Courtney.
After making the depbsit in Pacific Bank, he met Courtney ; they walked down Grand street, and met W oodman. Courtney said the boy ought not to see them together, and they immediately separated so as to avoid the boy.
It is conceded also, by the learned counsel for the respondents, that the only evidence of corroboration in the case is, first, the testimony of Woodman, the boy, who testifies that he had the check certified at the request of Barton, the accomplice, at about 1 p. m. on the 16th of May,""that he returned it to him and then -went to the Pacific Bank with him, where they separated, and that he (Woodman) then went through Grand street. And he then further said : â€?Coming through Crosby street, I seen this man Barton and Courtney together,â€?and that this was about fifteen minutes after the deposit of the check was made in the Pacific Bank; and further, that when he got near them, Barton turned round and went the other way, and Courtney turned and commenced looking up at the buildings; second, that William Bohncke, a witness, stated that he saw Barton and the appellant together; third, that Louis Oppikofer testified that he saw Barton and the appellant at his place with each other during the afternoon and forenoon of the month of May, every day for a fortnight. And fourthly, the testimony of Rogers, who arrested Courtney and Barton whilst in company with each other.
In this statment is presented the entire evidence of corroboration, which was offered as tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime charged.
The appellant denied expressly and positively all participation in the crime, and it appears from his evidence that when arrested he demanded an immediate trial. Is this evidence, thus stated, sufficient to justify the conviction, under section 399 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ? Or, in other words, has the testimony of the accomplice been corroborated by other evidence which tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime %
The section under consideration is new, and changes the law of this State with regard to convictions upon the testimony of accomplices, which were sustained, although based on such evidence alone (People v. Costello, 1 Denio, 83), the question of credibility being one for the jury. Similar statutes exist in other States of the Union (see Bishop on Crim. Pro. 3 ed. Â§Â§ 1169, 1170, note), and amongst others, in- the State of Texas. The statute in that State forbids a conviction on the testimony' of an accomplice, unless corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the offense committed, and is, therefore, substantially the same as ours.
The Supreme Court held, in considering it in Coleman v. State (44 Texas, 109), that the rule -of law forbidding a conviction on the testimony of an accomplice, unless corrobo-, rated by other testimony tending to connect the defendant with the offense committed, was under the statute positive and peremptory, and that however much the jury might be disposed to credit the accomplice, the defendant could not be convicted legally, unless the evidence of the accomplice was confirmed in some material matter tending to show the defendantâ€™s guilt. And the learned justice said in that case, â€?To allow convictions1 to stand where the corroboration is only in immaterial matters, would be to violate both the letter and spirit of the statute, and to disregard those precautionary rules which experienced and wise jurists have deemed it necessary to adopt in order to guard against erroneous convictions based on evidence unreliable, because coming from a corrupt source.â€?And in the case of State v. Thornton (26 Iowa, 80) the court, in considering a Statute similar to the one under consideration, said, â€?Admitting, as we do, that corroborating evidence; to be sufficient, must not merely relate to the commission of the offense or the circumstances thereof, but must be evidence of a character that shall connect the defendant with the commission of the alleged criminal act, it is the opinion of the court that evidence of this character was. produced by the State.â€?The corroborative evidence must be of some material fact, and this was the rule in reference to the evidence of accomplices in this State, if corroboration were relied upon, and indeed, the general rule. What appears to be required (See Roscoe Tr. 122, 6 Am. ed.), is, that there should be some fact deposed, independently altogether of the evidence of the accomplice, which, taken by itself, leads to the inference not only that a crime has been committed, but that the prisoner is implicated in it. In the case of the People v. Davis (21 Wend. 309), the charge excepted to was that the accomplices of the prisoner were not to be believed by the jury unless confirmed by other credible witnesses in respect to the facts connecting the prisoner with the possession of the forged bills, or with the manufacture of them; but the court declared that no error had been committed, because it was not necessary by existing rules that every part of the testimony should be confirmed, the question usually being whether the jury will believe the witness in such parts of his narrative as the confirmation extends to, and quoted with approbation the observation of Mr. Justice Andeeson in summing up the case of Bex v. Wilkes (7 Carr. & P. 272), namely, that the confirmation he always advised juries to require, was a confirmation of the accomplice in some facts which went to fix the guilt on the particular person charged. The confirmation in People v. Davis, supra, was the possession by the prisoner of the forged bills, which if not of the essence, went to the point of the offence charged, and if believed, the court said, pressed strongly against him and laid a foundation for giving credit to the narrative of his associates.
The only evidence, however, of corroboration, as we have already seen, is that the appellant was observed frequently in the society of the accomplice, and under circumstances of a suspicious character. But there is no other evidence in the case affecting himâ€”no proof that he participated in the money which was received by the check, no proof that he was in any way concerned with its preparation or presentation, no proof of bad character; whilst he most positively denies all participation in the criminal act.
The case, therefore, is one in which the accomplice proves all the material facts. The defendant denies them, his character is unassailed, and for that reason, presumed to be goodâ€”and the only circumstance which favors the truthfulness of the statement made by the accomplice is, that he had been seen in the society of the latter, and once at least, under circumstances of a suspicious character.
This is not the evidence contemplated under the section referred to. It is not a confirmation of the testimony. of the accomplice in some material facts tending to.show the defendantâ€™s guilt. The fact that another was in the company of a person who committed a.larceny, while well calculated to excite suspicion, was held to be no evidence that she knew the person with whom she was thus associating had any design to steal, and the fact of her going with such person even into the place where the theft was committed, was regarded as consistent with entire innocence, and being so was not proof of guilt. Ormsby v. People, 53 N. Y. 472.
The language of the statute, as we have seen, is that the accomplice must be corroborated by such other evidence as tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime. The existence of intimate relations is not a circumstance from which participation in the guilty acts of an associate is to be presumed, because it is consistent with innocence.
The association may be continued â€?and may be marked by all the circumstances which characterize the association of the accomplice and the appellant herein, and yet be an innocent one. In other words, the appellant might not have been advised in any way of the intended crime by the accomplice. It is not, in the language of the section, such other evidence as tends to connect the appellant with the commission of the crime. And this view of such a relation presents itself with peculiar force when the associate, upon his trial for an offence charged against him, the proof of which rests chiefly upon the testimony of the accomplice, solemnly denies all participation in the crime charged.
For these reasons, it is thought that the statute has been violated in this case and the conviction was improper. The judgment should therefore be reversed.

Davis, P. J.
â€”It is a grave mistake, I think, to assume that the testimony given by the defendant in this case, can have any legitimate effect upon the question whether there was corroborating evidence tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime.
His testimony and its contradictions of the evidence on the part of the People could only operate to produce an issue of fact for the consideration of the jury; and his denial of the truth of any evidence which tended to connect him with the commission of the crime, could not have any effect to diminish that tendency, however much it might impair the credibility of the evidence itself. When the question was raised that the evidence did not tend to comply with the requirements of the Code, that question was one of law, to be disposed of by the court, untinged by any other evidence which simply conflicted with its truth. We are, therefore, to look at the corroborating evidence alone to see if it tended to connect the prisoner with the commission of the offense. If it did, no matter how slightly, then the requirement of the Criminal Code is satisfied, and the question of the credibility of the. accomplice and the satisfactory character of this testimony becomes one for the puy-
In this case, there can be no doubt that the accomplice was to some extent corroborated. The prisoner was brought by other testimony than that of the accomplice, into connection with him, under circumstances of grave suspicion. Under the former rule, the court could properly have held that the evidence, if credited by the jury, did corroborate, with greater or less force, the testimony of the accomplice.
But that fact does not answer the requirements of the Code. Under the new rule, the testimony must not only corroborate, but must tend to connect the accused with the commission of the crime. In this case, the crime was shown to have been committed by the uttering of the forged check. My brother Bkadyâ€™s examination satisfies me that the corroboration was not of the character which the Code demands, because it did not tend to connect the accused with the commission of the crime. The testimony of the accomplice did that; but the Code will not be satisfied unless the accomplice is corroborated by evidence which tends to show the participation or immediate contact of the prisoner with the acts which constitute the crime. I am, therefore, obliged to concur with the conclusion that the-judgment should be reversed.

1164465,PEOPLE v. SMITH,1883-01,"Daniels, J.
â€”The defendant was convicted of the offense of violating the excise laws by making a sale of beer in quantity less than five gallons without license to the complainant witness. The evidence was wholly given by him to establish the alleged violation of the statute, and it was insisted in the defendantâ€™s behalf that she could not be convicted upon it, without further proof tending to connect her with the commission of the offense.
This objection was presented under section 399 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which has in terms prohibited a conviction upon the testimony of an accomplice, unless he be corroborated by such other evidence as tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime. But this witness in no manner participated in the act declared by the statute to be an offense. That was made out by the .sale itself, without license, and the person making the sale is the only one declared by the law to be criminal. The purchaser has been subjected to no criminal accountability whatsoever, and by the mere purchase he could not be a participant in the performance of the act which the statute has declared to be an offense... That was.performed wholly and conclusively by the defendant,, for she, unaided by the purchaser,â€?acted alone in making the sale. An accomplice is a person involved, either directly or indirectly, in the commission of the crime. To render him such, he must, in some manner, aid or assist, or participate in the criminal act, and by that connection he becomes equally involved in guilt with the other party by reason of the criminal transaction. This witness incurred no such relation to the offense committed, and therefore was not an accomplice within the meaning of this section of the Code. A point similar to this arose in Commonwealth v. Willard, 22 Pick. 476, and Commonwealth v. Downing, 4 Gray, 29, and it was held by the court pronouncing those decisions that such a purchaser was not an accomplice. A similar principle was also observed and applied in Campbell v. Commonwealth, 84 Penn. 187; State v. McKean, 36 Iowa, 348; President, &c. of St. Charles, v. Oâ€™Malley, 18 Ill. 407; Smith v. State, 37 Ala. N. S. 472; People v. Farrell, 30 Cal. 316.
It has been urged that the question whether this witness was an accomplice or - not should have been submitted to the jury, but that point was not raised upon the trial. And if it had been, the case of Commonweath v. Glover, 111 Mass. 395, differed so far in its controlling circumstances from the present case, as to render it inapplicable to the one now before the court upon the point.
The judgment from which the appeal has been taken should be affirmed.

1164466,"PEOPLE, ex rel. HENDERSON, v. THE JUSTICES OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL SESSIONS OF THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK",1882-03,"Davis, P. J.
â€”The appellant was tried in the court of special sessions on the 16th of August last, upon a complaint preferred by one Robert Richardson, charging him with the larceny of a $20 gold piece. He was convicted and sentenced to the penitentiary for three months. The appellant was a saloon keeper, and it appears by the testimony that the complainant went into his saloon and called for some lager. The complainant states what then took place, as follows:
â€?I gave him a $20 gold piece, and hesaid he had no change; I told him to go out and get change; he went out and did not come back again.
â€?Q. How much did you owe him ?
â€?A. Twenty-five cents.
â€?Q. How much money did you give him ?
â€?A. A $20 gold piece.
â€?Q. You gave it to him for the purpose of changing it and he did not return.
â€œA. Yes, sir.
â€œQ. You claim, therefore, that he has taken that $20 from you?
â€œA. Yes, sir.â€?On cross-examination, he further testified as follows:
â€?Q. You gave this man the $20 in his place of business ?
â€œA/ Yes, sir.'
â€?Q. He told you he was going to get some change ?
â€œA. Yes, sir.
â€?Q. When did you next see him after you gave him the $20 and he left the store ?
â€?A. After five oâ€™clock.
â€?Q. How long was it after you gave him the money ?
â€?A. I gave it to him between one and two oâ€™clock, and I guess it was half past five oâ€™clock when I saw him again.
â€?Q. Where did you see him then ?
â€?A. I met him on the street.
â€?Q. How far from his place of business ?
â€?A. A block or two; I am not certain.
â€?Q. You then spoke to him about the money ?
â€?A. The detective who was with me did.
â€?Q. What did he say ?
â€?A. He said he wanted to play some kind of game.â€?The appellant was called as a witness, in his own behalf, and he testified that the complainant came into his place and had something to drink, amounting to twenty-five cents; that he had only Â§14 in' change and told the complainant that, he had not enough to change the Â§20 gold piece; the complainant said â€?go out and get change and come back and give me my change; â€?that he went up the Sixth avenue as far as Thirtieth street to get change, and there he â€?played it,â€?and lost the Â§20, and had no intention, at the time he received the money, of cheating the complainant out of it. If the question presented by this case were a new one, we should have no hesitation in holding that the conviction was justified by the evidence ; for, it is clear that there was no intention on the part of the complainant, in handing the Â§20 gold piece to be changed, to part with his property in it, but that he simply parted with the possession for the specific purpose of having it changed, so as to enable him to pay to the appellant twenty-five cents out of change, and that the appellant, having it for a specific purpose, and without property, his possession was, in law, the possession of the owner of the coin, and his subsequent act in gambling it away was such a conversion as ought, and in our opinion does, constitute the crime of larceny. But the case is precisely parallel in all its features to that of Reg. v. Thomas, 9 Carr, & Payne,741. In that case the prisoner took a sovereign to go out and get it changed, but never returned with it or the change. Coleridge, J., held that the prosecutor, having permitted the sovereign to be taken away for change, could never have expected to receive bade that specific coin; he had, therefore, divested himself, at the time, of the entire possession of the sovereign; consequently, there was not a sufficient trespass to constitute larceny.
The learned judge overlooked Ann Atkinson's case (Cas. Cro. Law, 241), in which it was held that, if one stole guineas delivered for the purpose of being changed into half guineas, it was larceny. That case is cited approvingly in Havikins'Pleas of the Crown (vol. 1, p. 210), and again in 2 Russell on Crimes, p. 21, in both of which authorities the following is laid down as the law in such cases: â€?So, also, if a watchmaker steal a watch intrusted to him to clean, or if one steal clothes delivered for the purpose of being washed, or guineas delivered for the purpose of being changed into half guineas, or a watch delivered for the purpose of being pawned: in all these circumstances, the goods taken have been thought to remain in the possession of the' proprietor, and the taking of them away held to be felony.â€?Hawkins cites to each of these examples an authority on which it rests. But we are not at liberty to follow our own opinion of this case, because the court of appeals has distinctly recognized the case of Beg. v. Thomas as sound law. In Hildebrand v. People, 56 N. Y. 394, the facts were these: The prosecutor handed to the prisoner a $50 bill to take out ten cents, in payment for a glass of soda. The prisoner put down a few coppers upon the counter, and, when asked for the change, he took the prosecutor by the neck and shoved him out of doors, and kept the money. The question was, whether larceny could predicated upon these facts. The court of appeals, affirming the decision of this court, held that the prisoner was rightfully convicted. The prisoner relied upon the case of Reg. v. Thomas; and, after reciting the facts in that case, the court proceeded to distinguish it from the one then at bar by stating that in the Thomas case â€œall control, power and possession was parted with, and 'the prisoner was entrusted with the money and was not expected to return it. Here, as we have seen, the prosecutor retained the control, and legally, the possession and property. The line of distinction is a narrow one, but .it is substantial and sufficiently well defined.â€?The learned chief judge had previously, in describing the transaction in Hildebrandâ€™s case, said as follows:
â€?But in this case I do not think the prosecutor should be deemed to have parted either with the possession of or property in the bill. It was an incomplete transaction, to be consummated in the presence and under the personal control of the prosecutor. There was no trust or confidence reposed in the prisoner, and never was intended to be. The delivery of the bill and the giving change were to be simultaneous acts, and until the latter was paid, the delivery was not -complete. The prosecutor laid his bill upon the counter, and impliedly told the prisoner he could have it on delivering to him the sum of $49.90. Until this was done, neither possession or property passed, and in the meantime the bill remained, in legal contemplation, under the control and in the possession of the prosecutor.â€?This opinion had the unanimous concurrence of the court.
In People v. McDonald, 43 N. Y. 61, the same learned judge said: â€?If money or property is delivered by the owner to a person for mere custody, or for some specified purpose, the legal possession remains in the owner, and the criminal conversion of it by the custodian is larceny. A familiar illustration of this rule is the case of servants entrusted with the care of property belonging to their masters. In Smith v. People, 53 N. Y. 111, it was said by Allen, J., â€œThe rule is that when the deli veiy 1 of goods is made for a single and specific purpose, the possession is still-supposed' to reside; not parted with, in the first proprietor.â€?In Hildebrandâ€™s case the possession of the bill was delivered in the bar-room of the accused, for the purpose of being changed to take out the- sum of ten cents in payment for a glass of soda. The prisoner took and kept the bill and refused to deliver the change.
In this case the $26 go-id piece was delivered in the saloon for the purpose of being changed. The prisoner took the same for the purpose of getting it changed, went out to get the same with the consent of the complainant, but, instead of getting it changed, he went to a gambling place, and lost it in gambling. He had nothing but naked and manual possession for a specific purpose, totally without property.
The title to the coin remained in the complainant, and he could, at any moment, have recalled the possession before the coin was changed. If it had been taken from the possession of the prisoner by violence, the owner could have maintained trespass for injury to his property, and it would have been entirely proper, if the appellant had been robbed of the coin, to have averred, in an indictment for the robbery, the ownership in the complainant. The distinction in the cases is so extremely â€œnarrowâ€?that we should have felt entirely justified in disregarding it, but for the fact that the court of appeals in Hildebrand â€˜v. People gave its sanction to the case of Beg. v. Thomas, and declared it to be sound law, thereby holding, in effect, that a conviction of larceny could not be sustained in a case like this.
We are constrained, therefore, to accept that decision as authority, and, consequently, the conviction must be reversed and the appellant discharged.

1164467,THE JUSTICES OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL SESSIONS OF THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK v. PEOPLE ex rel. HENDERSON,1882-10,"Tracy, J.
â€”The $20 gold coin was entrusted to the relator for the single and specific purpose of having it changed into other money to be returned to the prosecutor. The relator had no propei'ty or interest in the coin, and the prosecutor never intended to part with his property therein. The relator left his restaurant with the coin under the pretense of obtaining change, and immediately gambled it away, and did not return. These facts warranted the jury in finding that, when he left the presence of the prosecutor, he took the coin with him with the intent to steal it. This, within all the authorities, except the one hereinafter referred to, justified his conviction for larceny. Hildebrand v. People, 56 N. Y. 394; Loomis v. People, 67 N. Y. 326; 1 Hawkins P. C. 210; 2 Russell on Crimes, 21. In Russell on Grimes and in Hawkins' Pleas of the Grown, the rule is stated as follows : â€?So, also, if a watch-maker steal a watch entrusted to him to clean, or if one steal clothes delivered to him for the purpose of being washed, or guineas delivered for the purpose of being changed into half guineas, or a watch delivered for the purpose of being pawned, in all these circumstances the goods taken have been thought to remain in possession of the proprietor, and the taking of them away held to be felony.â€?Hawkins cites, to each of these cases, an authority on which it rests. One of the cases so cited is that of Ann Atkinson, in which it was held that if one stole guineas delivered for the purpose of being changed into half guineas, it was larceny. Cas. Cro. Law, 2477. The ease of Reg. v. Thomas is a nisi prius case, reported in 9 Carr. & P. 741, where it was held by Coleridge, J.: â€?that the prosecutor, having permitted the sovereign to be taken away for change, could never have expected to receive back that specific coin. He has, therefore, divested himself at the time of the entire possession of the sovereign ; consequently, I think there was not a sufficient trespass to constitute larceny.â€?The learned presiding justice who delivered the opinion of the general term in this case, fell into an error in supposing that the doctrine of the case of Reg. v. Thomas had been adopted by this court as the law of this State. In the case of Hildebrand v. People, 56 N. Y. 294, where this court is supposed to have adopted the rule laid down in the case of Reg. v. Thomas, the plaintiff in error had been convicted of stealing a $50 bill handed him to take out ten cents in payment for a glass of soda. The prisoner put down a few coppers upon the counter, and, when asked for the change, took the prosecutor by the neck and shoved him out of doors, and kept the money. The prisoner was convicted, and the conviction was affirmed by this court. The case of Reg. v. Thomas was cited and relied upon by the prisoner. The facts of the two cases differed, and, after criticising the case of Reg. v. Thomas as a nisi prius case and not authoritative for that reason, the court pointed out the difference between the facts of that case and the facts of the case then being considered, without overruling or affirming the doctrine of Reg. v. Thomas.
In Loomis v. People, 67 N. Y. 329, the case of Reg. v. Thomas was again referred to, and this court there declared that the weight of authority was decidedly opposed to the doctrine of that case, and again affirmed a conviction in which that case was relied upon as an authority for reversal. The decisions of this court have been uniformly against the doctrine of Reg. v. Thomas. In the People v. McDonald, 43 N. Y. 617, this court held that: â€?If money or property is delivered by the owner to a person for mere custody or for some specified purpose, the legal possession remains in the owner, and the criminal conversion of. it by the custodian is larceny.â€?Again, in Smith v. People, 53 N. Y. 111, it was said by Allen, J., that â€?when the delivery of goods is made for a single and specific purpose the possession is still supposed to reside, not parted with, in the first proprietor.â€?The rule of Reg. v. Thomas was never adopted by this court, is not good law, and should be disregarded.

1164417,PEOPLE v. MAJONE,1882-10,"Daniels, J.
By the -indictment the defendant was accused of the crime of murder in the first degree, in taking the life of Maria Yallindina Selta, by means of the discharge of a pistol loaded with powder and a leaden bullet. And by the evidence which was given the fact was .proved that on December 9, 1881,. he discharged a pistol so loaded at the head of the deceased, and in consequence of the, wound then received by her, she died very soon afterwards. The case was submitted to the jury very .carefully and thoroughly, by the judge presiding at the trial, and no objection was taken to its submission, or to the manner in which that was done by the learned judge, but notwithstanding these omissions, the conviction is made the subject of review by chapter 330 of the Laws- of. 1858, which declares .that in a .capital case tried in'the Court-of General Sessions of the County of New York, â€?The appellate court may order a new trial if it shall be satisfied, that the verdict against the prisoner was against the weight of evidence, or against the law, or that justice requires a new trial, whether any exceptions shall have been taken or not in the court below.â€?The case consequently requires the same examination that it would if all the objection' and exceptions ordinarily used to present the effect of th evidence, for review, had been taken upon the trial. It i therefore necessary to examine the evidence, as well as the law, for the purpose of determining whether the jury lawfully convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree.
The person for whose killing lie was indicted, was the mother of his wdfe, and the facts transpiring at the time were chiefly related by her husband, who was at the time of the homicide sitting in the same room. His testimony in brief was, that the defendant returned to the house after about a quarter of an hourâ€™s absence, with a person named Pasquale La Posa, that â€?his (the prisonerâ€™s) wdfe was hanging out clothes at the window. The prisoner told her to go in and bring out a box from under the bed. â€˜I have to give a receipt to Pasquale La Posa.â€?His wife said, â€?I am here, hanging out some clothes; go yourself and bring it.â€?Then he said, â€?Either I will go, or you will go,â€?and took her by the arm and led her into the room. He said nothing while he was walking to the room. As soon as he was in the bed-room, we heard a report of a revolver. The door of the bed-room was open when they went in ; they did not close the door. As soon as they went in, we heard the report. The prisoner then came out and put the pistol to my wifeâ€™s head and fired. He did not say anything.â€?The witness, La Posa, corroborated the correctness of these statements. His evidence was that, as soon as the defendant and his wife â€?went into the room, we heard the report of a revolver. Soon after the report, he came out and fired at his mother-in-law.â€?Prom these facts it would be very natural, as well as logical, to infer that the defendant intended to kill this woman, at the time he presented and fired the pistol, for that was the necessary consequence of the act committed by him. And 'the rule is that when â€œA sane man, voluntarily acting upon motives, must be presumed to contemplate and intend the necessary, natural and probable consequences of bis own acts. If, therefore, one voluntarily or willfully does an act which has a direct tendency to destroy anotherâ€™s life, the natural and necessary conclusion from the act is that he intended so to destroy such personâ€™s life.â€?1 Greenleaf on Ev. Â§ 18, 7 ed; Dixonâ€™s Case, 3 Maule & S. 11, 15 ; Commonwealth v. York, 9 Met. 93, 103 ; Commonwealth v. Webster, 5 Cush. 295, 304; 305; Catlin v. Springfield, &c. Ins. Co., 1 Sumn. 435, 446; Van Pelt v. McGrau, 4 Com. 110, 114; Burrill Circumst. Ev. 49.
In proceeding to this extent certainly the jury could encounter no difficulty in the case, for whether it be denominated a presumption of law, or a presumption of fact, an intent to kill, would be necessarily inferred from this state of facts.
Whether the jury was further at liberty to conclude that this intent had been made the subject of such deliberation as to create the crime of murder in the first degree, is the more important question remaining to be considered and determined. From the nature of the fact it must ordinarily be incapable of direct evidence, and its existence when it is ascertained must, therefore, be derived from the circumstances, and that it may be so derived when the circumstances justify such a conclusion, has been very fully settled by the authorities. Leighton v. People, 10 Abb. N. C. 261, 269; Sindram v. People, 88 N. Y. 196.
The facts bearing upon the solution of this point, as the case was presented by the prosecution, are that no immediate preceding quarrel or altercation appeared to have taken place between the defendant and this woman ; that he appeared as usual; that he carried a pistol always in his pocket, and without a word on his part or an act of present provocation on the part of the deceased, he walked directly to her from the room in which he had inflicted a similar mortal wound upon his wife, and discharged the pistol at the head of the deceased. The usual source of human action is-either impulse, or reflection. Where it is induced by a sudden impulse, the act is often performed without deliberation or reflection. But in the , present case no reason has been presented for supposing that the defendant acted in obedience to the promptings of any impulse hastily formed, for nothing at the time transpired which would naturally or probably have had the effect of producing that state of mind. And because of that circumstance, and because he appeared to act with coolness and design in passing from the bedroom to that in which this woman was killed, and there shooting her, there was reason for believing that his conduct conformed to a deliberate purpose previously existing in mind. lie had been absent from the house about a quarter of an hour, and nothing by the evidence, after his return, appeared to have occurred to create resentment on his part, against the mother of his wife. But it is probable, from the statement made by him immediately after the discharge of the pistol, and when he left the house and was about to shoot himself, as he soon did, in which he stated : â€?I take my life on account of my mother-in-law,â€?that some preceding difficulty or cause of estrangement had arisen between these persons, and that he had made it the object of reflection before the time when he presented and discharged the pistol. This statement, together with the fact that he carried the pistol in his pocket, and presented no unusual appearance upon this occasion, and acted apparently with coolness in the execution of a design that had probably been formed by him, was sufficient to present the question to the jury, whether he had made this intent the subject of such deliberation as to render his act that of murder in the first degree. In determining this point the jury were required to weigh the probabilities and decide by their power of common sense what was the state of the defendantâ€™s mind. And to do that required only such a process of reasoning as persons of common experience and intelligent understanding are accustomed to follow. Upon this subject it has been said, that â€?presumptive evidence and the presumption or proofs, to which it gives rise, are not indebted for their probative force to any rules of positive law; but juries, in inferring one act from others which have been established, do nothing more than apply, under sanction of the law, a process of reasoning, the force of which rests on experience and observation, and such inferences are presumptions of facts.â€?This is â€?the presumption of the existence of one fact from the existence of anotherâ€”that is, the process of ascertaining one fact from the proof of another,â€?and it is within the exclusive province of a jury. Justice v. Lang, 52 N. Y. 323, 328, 329.
As there was no good reason for believing that the defendant was actuated by mere impulse, for none, as a matter of fact, was then shown to have been occasioned, and persons acting as the defendant did, ordinarily act from deliberation and reflection, nothing was proved in the case as it was presented by the prosecution, which would enable the jury consistently to adopt any other conclusion than the ""one which they did by their verdict.
The case was not relieved from this result by the evidence which the defendant gave as witness in his own behalf '; for as that was given he appeared to have had preceding differences of a serious nature, with the mother of his wife, in consequence of Avhich it could very well be reasonably concluded that he had' formed a deliberate purpose of taking her life. For he stated that he had difficulty with his mother-in-law, concerning a man who had visited the house, and whom he did not want to come there. The defendant had been arrested for assaulting that man, and was to be tided for it. On Wednesday the trial was put over until the following Monday, which was two days after this homicide. He stated that when he returned home, he told her the case had been postponed, and she said that she would have false witnesses against him. He also stated that he had been at work in the country the week before this, and when he returned his mother-in-law refused to allow his wife to eat with or stay with him; that on the morning of the day of the homicide, while he was in his bed, she ordered him to get up, and that she got hold of his throat and nearly choked him, saying: â€?Now Iâ€™ll choke you! â€?that after he got up and was passing out into the yard, she said : â€?I will give it to you well; yon will neither see the sun or moon any more; I will thrash you well.â€?Then he stated that he went out and thought of what had happened, and became confused in his mind and went to the house of La Rosa. From there they returned to the residence of his wife and her mother, and the conversation took place between himself and his wife, which was related by the witnesses on the part of the prosecution, and which has already been made the subject of reference. At the time of that convei'sation he said his wife â€?was looking sideways to her mother,' and her mother gave her a sign not to go.â€?That ho said: â€?â€?Why donâ€™t you want to obey me ; why do you want to obey your mother ? and I took her by the arm and said, come on and fetch that box. Then she went ahead, and I went after her. We entered the bed-room; my wife bent down to fetch the box out from behind the bed.â€?He then said that while he wras looking for the receipt she took the revolver out of a box on the floor and said : â€?Take this revolver and kill yourself. She gave the revolver into my hand; when I heard her speak that -way, I got- so confused I do not know what happened after-wards.â€?This latter statement as to his want of knowledge of what transpired was, of course, not probable in itself, and for that reason could very well be rejected by the jury, as unworthy of their belief; especially as the other evidence in the case tended, very directly, to show that the defendant acted as a â€¢person naturally would who entertained' a fixed design in his mind, which he was about to carry into execution. Assuming the other facts to be as the witness related them, then a motive for the killing of his wifeâ€™s mother is clearly supplied in the case.' It could very well be believed that the intention to commit the act had originated in these difficulties between himself and his mother-in-law. And if it did, then sufficient time elapsed after he left the house in the morning and before he returned and committed the crime, for him to deliberate upon and conclude to carry his criminal intent to kill into execution. And that he probably did that is sustained by the circumstance that when he saw, as he stated it, that his wifeâ€™s mother gave her sign not to go, it roused no such indignation or resentment, on his part, as induced him either to assail or even reproach her. If he was right in this supposition, the conviction did not lead to any result, for, after that, and without alluding to it, he coolly passed with his wife into the bed-room, and, after shooting her from there, proceeded to where her mother was sitting and inflicted this mortal wound upon her. That he had the conversation related by him with his wife in the bed-room is not consistent with the other evidence given in the case, for both Selta and La liosa, in their testimony, agree that the report of the revolver was heard as soon as the defendant and his wife went into the bed-room. It was highly probable, from this evidence, that the provocation given the defendant by this woman had led to the formation of an intention, on his part, to take her life, and that this intention had also formed the subject of his reflection after he left the house, and before he returned to it and proceeded with his wife to the bedroom. For, if he shot his wife as soon as they reached the bed-room, as the two witnesses agree in their testimony he did, it could hardly be doubted that he insisted upon her accompanying him there for the purpose of shooting her, and when that was done, to proceed immediately to execute the residue of his purpose by killing her mother. These acts, as they were performed, indicated a state of mind by which they had been previously planned, and what he did at this time was apparently to carry such a plan into execution. Whether the evidence is considered separately as it was presented by each case side of the case, or more properly as a whole in the form it was submitted to and probably considered by the jury, there certainly was enough made to appear to justify them in the view they adopted; that this was not only an intentional but a deliberate killing of this woman; for no other construction can reasonably be placed upon the conduct of the defendant on this occasion.
Exceptions were taken to the decisions of the court allowing proof to be given of what was said by the defendant immediately preceding his return to the house on the morning of the homicide, and following the occurrence of that event. These exceptions require no extended consideration, for what was said by him on each of these occasions tended, in a slight degree, to show the state of his mind when these interviews took place, and, in cases of this nature, evidence of that character is always considered pertinent. In no view of the case can it be assumed that the jury framed their verdict upon an unwarranted inference from the evidence submitted to them. On the contrary, the decided presumption from the facts as they were made to appear, both by the prosecution and the defense, was that this was a premeditated and deliberate homicide. Ho reasonable doubt of the defendantâ€™s guilt can be entertained, and both the judgment and order from which the appeals have been taken should be affirmed.

1164498,PEOPLE v. MAJONE,1883-01,"Earl, J.
The carefully prepared and able opinion pronounced in this case at the general term, makes it unimportant that much should be written now.
The defendant was tried and convicted in the Court of General Sessions, in the city of New York, and hence, under chapter 330 of the Laws of 1858, this court â€?may order a new trial, if it shall be satisfied that the verdict against the prisoner was against the weight of evidence, or against the law, or that justice requires a new trial.â€?With this provision of law before us, we can see no reason for granting a new trial. The defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree, and that crime is defined by the statute to be the intentional killing of a human being without the authority of law, when such killing is â€?perpetrated from a deliberate and premeditated design to effect the death of the person killed, or of any human being.â€?The main contention of the defendantâ€™s counsel in his argument before us was, that the evidence does not justify the finding that the killing in this case was deliberate and premeditated.
Under the statute, there must be, not only an intention to kill, but there must also be a deliberate and premeditated design to kill. Such design must precede the killing by some appreciable space of time. But the time need not be long; it must be sufficient for some reflection and consideration upon the matter, for choice to kill or not to kill, and for the formation of a definite purpose to kill, and when the time is sufficient for this, it matters not how brief it is. The human mind acts with celerity which it is sometimes impossible to measure, and whether a deliberate and piâ€™emeditated design to kill was formed, must be determined from all the circumstances of the case.
Here the most material facts, as we believe the evidence established them, are as follows : The defendant, an Italian street musician, about twenty-two years of age, in June, 1881, married a young Italian girl, just past thirteen years of age. After their marriage, they lived for a time with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Selta; he did not at all times, as we may infer, live harmoniously with his wife, and had some difficulty with his mother-in-law,- Mrs. Selta. On the morning of December 9, 1881, he left the house where he was residing, and ' called upon his friend, Bosa, and conversed with him about some money he owed him, and about a receipt he was keeping for him, and he, Bosa, returned with him to his house and entered the room where his wife and Mr. and Mrs. Selta then were. Bosa, Mr. Selta and the defendant were the only living witnesses to what then took place there, and the two former, whose evidence is more probable and credible than that of the defendant, agree in the following version of what happened there. As the defendant entered the room, his wife was hanging clothes out of a window, and he asked her.to go into a bedroom and bring out a little box containing Eosaâ€™s receipt. She replied that she was hanging up the clothes and that he should go and get the box for himself; he, replying, â€?will you or will I go,â€?took her by the arm and led her into the bed-room, saying nothing. Immediately after they entered the bed-room, the two witnesses heard the report of a revolver, and .he then came out with the revolver in his hand, and putting it to the head of Mrs. Selta, fired it. He then starred to leave the room and pointed the revolver at Eosa, who attempted to intercept him, and went down stairs and fired two shots into his own per-' son. He killed both his wife and her.'mother. There was no altercation on the occasion of the shooting, and no provocation then, except the refusal of his wife to comply with his request. It does not aqpear that Mrs. Selta had any conversation whatever with him. The qoistol belonged to him, and had been for some time in his 2>ossession. His account of the affair differs somewhat from that given by the other witnesses, and his evidence tended to show that he was greatly 2>rovoked by what his wife did and said then, and by what his mother-in-law then did and had before said and done that morning. But we have no reason to doubt that the other witnesses gave a correct account of the affair, and their evidence, leaves no doubt on our minds that the killing was intentional, deliberate and premeditated.
There was no error in the reception of the evidence as to the conversation had by the defendant with Eosa, a few minutes before the killing ; that was competent, although not very important, as throwing light upon the state of his mind and his subsequent conduct, and explaining the language used by him to his wife.
We have thus noticed .the only grounds of error alleged on behalf of the defendant, and are of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.

1164419,PEOPLE v. TWEED,1882-07,"The following opinion was delivered by the General Term:
Daniels, J.
It is conceded by the learned counsel presenting .the case on behalf of the appellant that he could properly have .â€¢been convicted of the crime of petit larceny, and it is claimed by him that the verdict should not have been permitted to exceed the bounds of that offense.
The offense itself was committed by depriving the complaining witness of certain English gold coin owned by him, with a felonious intent on the part of the defendant and certain confederates acting in concert with him. One half the amount which was lost, and not exceeding the amount of twenty-five .dollars, was staked upon a pretended drawing in what was represented to be an art lottery. The complaining witness had been induced to participate in the drawing by the defendant and his confederates with the intent, by means of a trick and device, to deprive him of his money. This constituted the crime -of larceny within the cases of Smith v. People, 53 N. Y. 111, and Loomis v. People, 67 Id., 322. After this first amount had been deposited upon the table the defendant took it up and within three minutes placed it upon what appeared to be bank-notes. There it was permitted to remain until another deposit of the same amount was made by the witness, and, after â–?that deposit was made and the second drawing took place, all the money was taken together in one lot and delivered by the prisoner to one of the confederates, by whom it was appropriated and detained from the witness. The final taking included a larger amount than has been required by the statute to create the crime of grand larceny. But that offence was not committed by what was shown to have taken place, if the taking of the first amount by the defendant created the crime of larceny.
The case was fairly submitted to the jury upon the point' whether the defendant, in taking up and putting down the first amount, intended to steal it, or whether the intent to steal was not restricted to the final taking when the whole amount of money was taken by the defendant and passed over to a confederate.
""Why the defendant first took up the coin which the witness had placed upon the table does not otherwise appear than by the act of simply taking it up from the place where it had been deposited upon the table, and then placing it upon what appeared to be bank-notes. JSfo other act was performed by him from which it could be inferred that he, at that time, by what he did, intended to steal this particular sum of money. The act itself surely did not deprive the witness of his property. It was as much within his control when it was placed upon the notes as it previously had been when it stood upon the table. And as the defendant did nothing more with the money at that time than to take it from one place on the table and deposit it upon the other, it may reasonably be presumed that this was all that he intended at the time when he took up the coin. All that he did was to transfer the coin from one place to another place, upon the table, and in the absence of any other circumstance tending to warrant the conclusion that by that act he intended to appropriate the money feloniously to his own use, the presumption arising would be that such was not his intention, but that he was actuated by the mere purpose of changing the location of the money upon the table. This was the effect of what he did, and persons may ordinarily be presumed to intend only what by their acts they at the time accomplish. People v. Herrick, 13 Wend. 87, 91; Van Pelt v. McGraw, 4 Coms. 110, 114.
This principle is directly applicable to this case, and the jury were warranted by it in inferring that the defendant at the time when he changed the position of the coin did not intend to steal it, but that the intent to steal was only carried into effect when he took up the entire amount of the coin exceeding the sum of twenty-five dollars and transferred it to his confederate. And that rendered the case one of grand larceny.
The case was sufficiently sustained by the evidence to render this question of intent a proper subject for the determination of the jury. And as this point is the only one upon which the propriety of the conviction has been assailed, and it was rightly disposed of on the trial, the judgment from which the appeal has been taken should he affirmed.

1164420,PEOPLE v. MURPHY,1882-10,"Davis, P. J.
The appellant was convicted of the crime of larceny from the person, and sentenced to imprisonment in the State prison for the term of four years. The crime was alleged to have been committed upon the person of one John Olson. Olson had been committed as a witness, to' the house of detention, and afterwards had been discharged on giving bail for his appearance as a witness on the trial of the charge. In the recognizance given for his appearance, he described himself as residing at Ho. 3 Henry Street, in the city of Hew York, and his surety Edward Maher described himself as residing at Ho. 118 White street, in said city. Maher justified as bail, deposing that he was the owner of two lots, numbers T06 and 108 Eeade street, in said city, of the value of one hundred thousand dollars, which were incumbered for sixty thousand dollars. Olson failed to appear, as a witness at the trial,, and it was sought to make use of his deposition taken before the police magistrate at the time the complaint was made, I nder the provisions of section 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which allows depositions in certain cases to be read at the trial â€?upon it being satisfactorily shown to the court that he (the witness) is dead or insane, or cannot with due diligence be found in the State.â€?It was not shown that Olson was either insane or dead, and for the purpose of showing due diligence, officer William Plynn was called, who testified in substance that a few days before the trial, by the direction of the district attorney, he made efforts to find Olson, and for that purpose went to Oliver street, in the city of Hew York, and made inquiry of divers persons, but could learn nothing of Olsonâ€™s whereabouts, but was told that he had not resided there for some two years. The reason assigned by the officer for going to Oliver street was that the complainant Olson told him that he was stopping there, â€?the night before he made complaint at the Tombs.â€?H o inquiry was made at Ho. 3 Henry street, and none at Ho 118 White street, the residence of Olsonâ€™s bail; and none of the bail anywhere.
It was objected by counsel for the prisoner that sufficient proof of diligence had not been given to warrant the reading of the deposition in evidence. This objection was overruled, and the counsel duly excepted. We think this exception was well taken. What the officer had done was under the circumstances quite insufficient. The witness had not given Oliver street as his place of residence, but at most had stated that he had stopped there the night before he w'as examined. In his deposition he said he had no home, but in his recognizance he declared himself a resident of Ho. 3 Henry street, and the surety he gave also specified in the same instrument his residence. Diligence certainly required that Olson should be sought for at Ho. 3 Henry street, and if his whereabouts could not be ascertained, then that inquiry should be made of his surety at the residence of the latter; for the reasonable presumption is that the surety could give information that would enable the officer to ascertain definitely whether Olson could or could not be found in the State.
Within the authority of Barr v. People (1 N. Y. 386), there seems to us no question that the effort to find the complainant was not sufficient to justify the reading of the deposition.
Without considering the other questions in the case, we are of opinion that the judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered, for the error already considered.

1164483,PEOPLE v. McGLOIN,1882-10,"Brady, P. J.
The prisoner was indicted for the commission of the offense of murder in the first degree. There were two counts in the indictment. The first charged the killing of one Hanier while the prisoner with others was engaged in the perpetration of a felony, the second count charges that the prisoner with other persons having on December 30, 1881, made an assault upon the person of the deceased with a pistol loaded with powder and ball, and with a deliberate and premeditated attempt to kill Hanier, and in pursuance of such deliberate and premeditated intent did kill him. On the trial, proof having been given tending to show the commission of the burglary in which the prisoner had participated, and of circumstances also tending to establish the fact that the prisoner-while so engaged fired the fatal shot, a statement made by him before one of the coroners of this city, was offered in .evidence. This statement is a confession of the crime of burglary and the shooting of the deceased by him. Its reception in evidence was objected to on his behalf, upon the ground that it had been obtained by threats and improper influence, and was not in conformity to the provisions of the. statute in reference to statements made before magistrates.
It appeared in regard to it that the prisoner was arrested by Inspector Byrnes, to whom he said that he did not know what he was charged with, whereupon he was told that he was charged with the shooting of Louis Hanier. He was then asked by the inspector if he knew who he was, and was told by the latter that he was an inspector of police. The inspector then said, â€?I told him I saw him do several things and try to steal in South Fifth avenue the night before I arrested him. I told him I had been watching him since the shooting and saw him in company with a man named Healey, and saw him try to steal a barrel of whiskey the night before I arrested him.â€?He also said, â€?I told him about the pledging of the pistolâ€?(that is, the pistol with which the shooting was done). In answer to a question by the court: â€?Did you make any threats to this man ?â€?Inspector Byrnes said, â€?Ho, I did not.â€?He was then asked by the recorder, â€?Did you hold out any inducement to him?â€?and he answered, â€œHo sir, I did not, not any.â€?â€?And further, â€?You merely stated what you did ?â€?and he replied, â€?Yes sir,â€?and further; â€?and that you were an inspector of police ?â€?and he replied, â€?Yes sir.â€?The inspector then further testified : â€?MeGloin said he would make a statement. I said I would send for Coroner Herrman to take- it.â€?And it appears by the statement that MeGloin was informed by Coroner Herr-man of the matter which was before him, and that he had the privilege and right either to make a statement or not. It also appears by his confession that the coroner called his attention to the fact that he should consider well before he made a statement, as he would ask more from him regarding the shooting of Iianier. It does not appear, however, from the statement itself that any questions whatever were asked by the coroner.
The statement which is contemplated by the statute is regulated by the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, sections 198, 199 and 200. But these provisions apply to an examination before a magistrate for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not a crime has been committed, and not to any proceeding before a coroner. The statement, therefore, cannot be declared to have been taken under or in reference to these provisions ; indeed, it must be regarded entirely as extra-judicial. It is governed and controlled, therefore, in its value and effect by section 395 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that a confession of a defendant, whether in the course of judicial proceedings or to a private person, can be given in evidence against him, unless made under the influence of fear produced by threats. Whatever may have been the'rule prior to the enactment of this section, the law o.f this State is now settled by its features, because the objection to the confession is limited, it would seem, to the proposition that it was made under the influence of fear produced' by threats.
In this case it is quite evident that no threats were made and no inducements held out. Inspector Byrnes advised the prisoner that he had been watching him and knew of certain acts that he had committed, and that is all; and the prisoner, before he made his statement, was duly advised that he was under no obligations to make it, and that he should consider well before so doing. There seems to be no doubt that a confession under such circumstances would have been admissible prior to the enactment of the statute to which reference has been made
It was declared in the case of Cox v. People (80 N. Y. 515), that it was not sufficient to exclude a confession by a prisoner that he was under arrest at the time it was made, or that it was made to the officer in whose custody he was, or in answer to questions put by him, or that it was made under hope or promise of a benefit of a collateral nature. In that case the officer who made the arrest said to Cox, â€?Youâ€™re in a bad fix,â€?which was substantially what Inspector Byrnes said to the prisoner here, when he informed him that he had been watching him and knew of certain acts of his, including the pawning of the pistol with which the fatal shot was fired.
But the section in the Code of Criminal Procedure, in phraseology at least, limits the objection to a confession to the ground simply that it was made under the influence of fear produced by threats; and, therefore, no matter what may have been the rule heretofore, as already suggested, if the confession was not the result of fear produced by threats, or it may be by inducements held out, if the statute should ultimately be so construed, it may be admitted in evidence against the prisoner.
For these reasons it is considered that this objection to the reception of the confession was properly overruled. It was also urged against the reception of the confession that it was one to which the prisoner had been sworn, and which made it, it was contended, particularly objectionable under the authorities. The learned counsel for the prisoner seems to treat the confession as a statement made by a witness upon an examination in a proceeding before a magistrate. We have seen that this view' cannot be sustained. It was not. taken during the ordinary investigation which takes place before a coroner as to a death and its cause, nor was the prisoner a witness. Not only that, but he knew the offence of which he was charged, and made the statement, after being advised of it, and voluntarily.
In the case of Teachout v. People, 41 N. Y. 7, the subject of verified statements was considered and questions relating to them determined, and it was held that the statement of a person advised that he was charged with an offense, and made when examined as a witness, might be given in evidence against him, notwithstanding that it was made under oath and in a proceeding which related to the crime itself. If the confession, therefore, should be regarded as the prisonerâ€™s statement upon the stand as a witness, after having been advised, as he was, of the charge made against him, it would have been admissible on the authority of the case cited, and the exception founded on the. proposition just considered is therefore unavailable. The objections to the admission of the confession thus considered were properly overruled for these reasons, and the confession itself properly admitted in evidence. It is also urged, on behalf of the prisoner, that the testimony of one Frederick Banfield, who had been convicted and sentenced for the commission of a felony, and had not been pardoned should not have been received in evidence, although no objection was made on the part of the prisoner to his examination or to the testimony which he gave. His evidence related to statements made by the prisoner to him affecting the question of his guilt. The objection rests upon the section of the Eevised Statues, which declares that a person who is sentenced for the commission of a felony shall not be competent to testify in any cause, matter, or proceeding, civil or criminal, unless he be pardoned by the governor or by the legislature, except in cases specially provided by law. 3 R. S. 6 ed. Banks, p. 994, Â§ 43.
By chapter 448, Laws of 1876, section 832, it was declared, however, in antagonism to this section, that a person convicted of a crime or misdemeanor is, notwithstanding, a competent witness, but the conviction may be proved for the purpose of affecting the weight of his evidence, and a doubt having arisen as to whether the section applied to criminal prosecutions, the legislature, in 1879, in order to remove it (see chap. 542, Laws of that year), amended the section by adding, after the words â€?competent witness,â€?the words â€œin a civil or - criminal action or special proceeding.â€?The same provision is contained in section 714 of the Penal Code, passed in 1881.
The witness objected to, had not only been convicted, but sentenced, and the counsel for the plaintiff in error thinks because of the latter incident the provisions of Eevised Statutes referred to apply, and not those of the Code. He contends that the legislature, not having in express words repealed them, intended, by leaving them thus unrepealed, to make a distinction between criminals convicted and sentenced, allowing the former to be witnesses and the latter not.
This view, assuming that the plaintiff in error has the right to present the question involved for consideration, cannot be sustained. It is the conviction, and not the sentence, which creates the objectionable event in the life of the witness and is the primary cause of his disqualification. A person convicted might not be sentenced before being called as a witness, either because of delay in the performance of that ceremony, or because of the suspension of judgment. The sentence is the result of the conviction, and pronounced as a punishment for the crime committed, and is therefore secondary in its nature. The greater includes the lesser. The provision of the Revised Statutes is repealed by implication because it and that in the Code are utterly inconsistent with each other.
It would be absurd to hold that the legislature intended to absolutely disqualify as a witness a person who was sentenced for the commission of a crime, and to preserve his qualification if only convicted. The legislation of 1876 and 1879, was designed to affect the existing rule on the subject and to abrogate it; see note to section 832 in Throopâ€™s Code, ed. 1877 ; and it may well be, if the matter were at all considered in the respect mentioned, that the conviction was regarded as the first and most salient, and therefore controlling incident in the element of disqualification, as it certainly is. For these reasons it is: thought that the evidence of Banfield was properly received. It is further contended that there should be a new trial by reason of the refusal to grant a request to charge. The first count to the indictment, as we have already seen, charged the defendant with having committed a felony, and whilst so engaged, with having killed the deceased.
Section 395 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides as follows : â€œA confession of a defendant, whether in the course of judicial proceedings or to a private person, can be given in evidence against him unless made under the influence of fear produced by threats or unless made upon a stipulation of the district attorney, that he shall not be prosecuted therefor ; bul it is not sufficient to warrant Ms conviction without additional proof that the crime charged has been committed. â€?In reference to which the prisonerâ€™s counsel requested the court to charge :
â€?That in order to convict on the first count of the indictment, the jury must be satisfied beyond Ã¡ reasonable doubt: 1st. A burglary or larceny was committed by the prisoner; 2nd. That whilst so engaged in the commission of either or both of said offenses, the prisoner killed the deceased. Before the jury can consider the proposition as to the killing whilst in the perpetration of a felony, they must find that there was evidence, exclusive of the confession of the prisoner, that the felony had been committed. That the prisonerâ€™s alleged confession is not sufficient to warrant the juryin finding affirmatively, that the offense of burglary or grand larceny, or both of said offenses, had been committed, without additional proof on the subject.â€?Which the court refused, and exception was taken to such refusal.
This request, at first, seems formidable, but upon examination it clearly appears that the refusal to charge it was correct. The proposition is, that in order to convict under the first count, the jury must be satisfied that a burglary or larceny was committed by the prisoner, and whilst he was engaged in the commission of either, or both, he killed the deceased.
It would have been error to charge this request, because the prisoner, under the first count of the indictment, might have been convicted of manslaughter, to accomplish which it would not have been necessary to establish either burglary or larceny, of which the jury were duly advised, not only in the general charge, but by the request of the prisonerâ€™s counsel to charge, which was granted. He requested the court to charge the jury that they could under the indictment convict the plaintiff in error of manslaughter in the first degree, and the request was granted. If the request considered involved the proposition, that in order to convict the plaintiff in error of murder in- the first degree, under the first count of the indictment, it would be necessary to establish the elements expressed, it would have been erroneous to have refused to charge it. And that this view was taken of it by the learned recorder, is very clear from the fact that the next request to charge, and which was granted, was, that if the jury found the alleged confession of the prisoner to be the only evidence of the larceny or burglary, or both of these offenses, they could not convict of murder in the first degree, under the first count of the indictment. This was charging the law of the case as formulated by the prisonerâ€™s counsel, and although it had been substantially charged before, was thus repeated. The jury was doubly instructed, therefore, that to justify a conviction of murder in the first degree, it was necessary, in accordance with the provisions of section 395 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, supra, to establish by sufficient proof thereof, in addition to the confession, that the crime charged had been committed,â€”i. <?., that a felony had been committed by the prisoner, and that, whilst engaged in the commission of it, he had killed the deceased.
The questions thus discussed are those only upon which the decision of this appeal rests, and having arrived -at conclusions adverse to the plaintiff in error, the judgment of the court below must be affirmed.

1164484,PEOPLE v. FABER,1883-04,"Rapallo, J.
The question in this case is whether contracting a marriage in this State, in violation of section 49 of the act concerning divorces (2 R. S. 146), constitutes the crime of bigamy, as defined in 2 R. S. 687, sections 8, 9 ; or is punishable only as a misdemeanor. The provisions of the Revised Statutes bearing upon the question are as follows :
Article 1 of title 1, chapter 8, ""part 2, relating to marriage, provides (section 5): â€œHo second or other subsequent marriage shall be contracted by any person during the lifetime of any ^former husband.or wife of such person, unlessâ€?. The marriage with such- former husband or wife shall have been annulled or dissolved for some cause other than the adultery of the accusedâ€?(2 R. S. 139).
â–?Article 3 of the same title, concerning divorces (2 R. S. 144), provides (section 38): â€?Divorces may be decreed, and marriages may be dissolved by the court of chancery, whenever adultery has been committed by any husband or wife. â€?Section 49: . â€?Whenever a marriage shall be dissolved, pursuant to the provisions of this article, the complainant may marry again during the lifetime of the defendant, but no defendant convicted of adultery shall marry again' until the death of the complainant.â€?Article 2 of title 5 of chapter 1 of part 4 of the Revised Statutes, entitled â€?Of unlawful marriages and of incest â€?(2 R. S. 687), provides (Â§ 8): â€?Every person having a husband or wife living, who shall marry any other person, whether married or single, shall, except in the cases specified in the next section, be adjudged guilty of bigamy; and upon conviction shall be punished by imprisonment in the' state prison for a term not exceeding five years. â€?Section 9 : â€?The last section shall not extend to the following persons or cases.â€?Then follow six subdivisions, the third of which is : â€?3. To any person by reason of any former marriage which shall have been dissolved by the decree of a competent court, for some cause other than the adultery of such person.â€?Reading all these provisions together, the conclusion seems irresistible that the intent of the statute was that section 8 should extend to a divorced person who did not come within the exception.' The language clearly implies that notwithstanding the divorce such a person is placed in the situation of haying a husband or wife living, for the purposes of the eighth section.
The third subdivision imports into the statute, for the punishment of bigamy, almost the identical language which is employed in 2 R. S. 139, Â§ 5, subd. 1, which prohibits and declares unlawful certain marriages, the only difference being that in 2 R. 8. 139, a husband or wife by the first marriage who has obtained a divorce is spoken of as the former husband or wife, and in subdivision 3 of section 8 the prior marriage is spoken of as the former marriage; but the intent is clear that the prohibition contained in the statutes concerning marriages and divorces shall be incorporated into the statutes punishing bigamy. The language of the latter act, where the sections are connected is, that every person having a husband or wife living, who shall marry, &c., shall be guilty of bigamy, except where the former marriage has been dissolved for some cause other than the adultery of the person contracting the subsequent marriage. There could scarcely be a plainer implication than that, for the purpose of enforcing the statutory prohibition, a person against whom a divorce has been obtained for that cause is regarded by the statute as having a husband or wife living, so long as the party obtaining the divorce lives.
The judgment of the General Term in this case was based upon the case of People v. Hovey (5 Barb. 117), which was decided in 1849 by the General Term of the Supreme Court in the Seventh District. In that case it was held that a violation of the prohibition against marriage of the guilty party contained in the divorce act, did not constitute bigamy, and the reasons assigned for that conclusion were that the divorce dissolved the former marriage and, after such dissolution-, neither party could have a husband or wife living; that, consequently, such a case was not included in section 8, and the provisions of that section could not be enlarged by the exception contained in the third subdivision of section 9.
This criticism of the language of the section cannot, in our judgment, overcome the clear and unmistakable intent apparent on the face of the provisions when read together. The declaration that the eighth section shall not extend to a person by reason of a former marriage which has been dissolved by the decree of a competent court for some cause other than the adultery of such person, clearly assumes that it does extend to a person whose former marriage has been dissolved for his or her adultery. If not, the third subdivision of section 9 is wholly without meaning or operation.
The same argument which was used in People v. Hovey was subsequently sought to be employed in the case of Wait v. Wait (4 N. Y. 95). In that case the plaintiff claimed dower in lands left by a husband from whom she had obtained a divorce a vinculo on the ground of his adultery. There is no express provision of the statute declaring a widow entitled to dower under such circumstances, but the right of dower is not taken away ; and its continuance is impliedly recognized in section 48 of the divorce act (2 R. S. 146), which declares that a wife convicted of adultery in a suit for a divorce brought by her husband shall not be entitled to dower in her husbandâ€™s real estate. In the case cited it was argued by Mr. Hill that the right to dower could only be acquired by the death of the husband; that only a widow had a dowerable capacity,, and that she must have such capacity at the time of his death ; that she could be endowed of lands of her deceased husband only; that she must survive her husband, and that she must be a wife at the time of his decease, or she cannot be his widow ; that the marriage being dissolved, she ceased to be his wife and could not be his widow. But this construction of language was not suffered to prevail, and it was held that, although the term widow might not be the most appropriate term to employ under these circumstances, yet it was sufficient to designate the person entitled to dower, and the conclusion was that the divorced wife was entitled to the benefit of the statute which awards dower to the widow.
A reference to section 48 of the divorce act (2 R. S. 146) is also instructive as showing that for some purposes the Legislature apply the terms â€?husband â€?and â€?wife â€?to parties between whom a decree of divorce a vinculo has been pronounced. The language of section 48 is â€?a wife,â€?being a defendant in a suit for a divorce brought by her husband, and â€?convicted â€?of adultery, shall not be entitled to dower in her â€?husbandâ€™s â€?real estate. The terms â€?husband â€?and â€?wife â€?are thus applied to the parties after the judgment of divorce has been rendered, without the addition of the term â€?former,â€?or any' other term indicating that the parties had ceased to answer the description of husband and wife.
A reference to the history of our statute against bigamy shows very conclusively that its framers intended it to apply to a case like the present one. The first act on the subject was passed February 7, 1788, and was re-enacted in 1 R. S. 113, as follows:
â€?That if any person or persons being married or who hereafter shall marry, do at any time marry any person, or persons, the former husband or wife being alive, then any such person shall be guilty of a felony .... But neither this act or anything therein contained shall extend to any person or persons â€?. . . then follow five specifications, the third of which is, â€?nor to any person or persons who are or shall be at the time of such marriage, divorced by the sentence or decree of any court having cognizance thereof.â€?In framing the provisions of the Revised Statutes it is stated by the revisers, in their original note to section 8 (the statute against bigamy), that it was the same as 1 R. S. 113, varied by inserting â€?whether married or single â€?to reach cases not supposed to be within the act; and the note to section 9 states that the first five subdivisions are founded upon 1 R. S., 113, the third being qualified according to 2 R. S., 198, Â§ 4. Section 4 here referred to. is contained in the divorce law of 1813, and is the provision that it shall not be lawful for the defendant, who may be convicted of adultery, to marry again until the complainant shall be actually dead. It cannot be doubted that the intention of the revisers was to bring a violation of this prohibition within the statute against bigamy.
The new Penal Code, adopted in 1881, re-enacts the statute in the same language as in the Revised Statutes, except that it has added to the third subdivision of section nine a further exception in favor of a divorced party who has obtained permission from the court to marry again, pursuant to the act authorizing such permission to be given.
Upon the theory of the respondent, all these elaborate provisions are senseless and without any effect whatever.
The utility of the prohibition of such marriage it is not for us to discuss here. So long as it stands upon the statute book, we are bound to give it force in the manner prescribed by the Legislature, when the.violation of it is committed within this State.
The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and that of the Court of General Sessions affirmed, and the proceedings remitted.
All concur except Andrews, J., who dissents on the ground that the construction of the statute on bigamy by the General Term in People v. Hovey (5 Barb. 117) has never been reversed or questioned in any judicial decision until now; and Earle, J., who dissents generally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164423,PEOPLE v. RYLAND,1883-01,"Davis, P. J.
The appellant was indicted with her husband and one Woodbury for forgery in the third degree. The crime was committed by altering a check made by Demarest & Duncan for $6 to the sum of $165.50, and uttering the same after such alteration.
The testimony tending to establish the crime was given chiefly by one Crawford, an accomplice therein, whose evidence, if credited by the jury, was sufficient to convict the appellant, unless the presumption of coercion on the part of her husband should operate to protect her.
One of the principal points made in the case on the part of the appellant, is, that the corroborating proof required by section 399 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was not given.
Before the enactment of this Code, it was well established that a conviction of crime could properly be had upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. People v. Costello, 1 Den. 86; People v. Davis, 21 Wend. 313; Linsday v. People, 63 N. Y. 143. It was the general practice of trial courts to charge juries that it was unsafe to convict without confirmation of the accomplice as to some material fact of the case; but this was not a rule of law; but rested in the sound discretion of the court, and the omission or refusal so - to charge was not error. Linsday v. People, supra.
Cases would necessarily be very rare in which there would not be some corroboration of the accomplice as to some material fact; and it was entirely safe to leave the question of the credibility of an accomplice in the hands of the jury. But the established rule of the common law has been materially changed by the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 399, as it stood at the time of the trial, enacted â€?that a conviction can not be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless he be corroborated by such other evidence as tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime,â€?â€?and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the crime or the circumstances thereof.â€?A more complete shield for certain classes of crimes which must always invariably be proved by accomplices, if at all, could not well be devised; for the corroboration, however strong in all other respects, must point to the connection of the defendant with the commission of the crime, to be of any avail. And in those secret crimes where usually the only witness to the connection of the defendant with the actual commission of the crime, is of necessity an accomplice, convictions will fail, however clearly the body of the crime is shown by additional evidence, becausÃ© the witness, though fully corroborated in other respects, may not be corroborated in the designation of the person who committed the secret offense. But the law as declared by the Code must be accepted and applied by the courts. It is our duty, therefore, to see whether in the strong corroboration of the accomplice in this case in other respects, there is any corroborating testimony which tends to connect the appellant with the commission of the forgery.
The evidence shows that a check for $6 payable to .the order of Georgiana Hace, was obtained from Messrs. Demurest & Duncan, upon their bank in this city; that the check was soon afterwards altered by erasing the name â€?Georgiana Maceâ€?and inserting the name â€?George S. Martin,â€?and by erasing the word â€?sixâ€?and inserting the words and figures â€?One hundred and sixty-five AAnâ€?i11 the body of the check, and by changing in like manner the figures in the margin of the check; and that the check so altered was presented at the bank and the money obtained upon it. These facts were abundantly proved without the testimony of the accomplice. They constituted the body of the crime. The accomplice also gave testimony, sufficient, if believed, to show these several facts, and to prove also that himself and the several persons named in the indictment were connected with the commission of the forgery, and shared in different proportions in its proceeds. The question was thus presented to the court whether any of the evidence outside of that given by the accomplice tended to connect the appellant with the forgery.. It was proved by Mr. Duncan, one of the firm of Demarest & Duncan, that the appellant came to their store in the evening of April 20, Ã¡nd said she wished to purchase a check, as the post-office was closed up, to send $6 to her sister or mother i-ir Philadelphia; and it would accommodate her very much to get it off that evening; that he thereupon drew the check and gave it to her, and received $6 from her: and that the check was the same that had been altered. It was then proved by the paying teller of the bank, . that the check was presented in its altered condition on April 22, and paid to the person who presented it, who is also one of the indictees. Then followed the testimony of the accomplice, showing the arrangement to get the check ; its procurement, by the appellant; its alteration by her husband- at her house ; and the subsequent obtaining of, and the division of the money, of which the appellant received the largest share.
It seems to us there can be no doubt, the forgery being proved, that this evidence, aliunde the accomplice, tended to connect the appellant with its commission. Unexplained, it showed that she got the check by an untrue representation that it was to be sent to her mother or sister in Philadelphia; that she caused it to be made payable to â€?Georgiana Mace â€â€”apparently a fictitious name; that she carried the check away that evening, and on the day but one following, it was presented at the bank in its forged condition and the raised amount obtained.
These facts tended to connect her with the criminal alteration of the check, because they were sufficient to put her on explanation. They connected her with the check under very suspicious circumstances, from which, if unexplained, a fair inference grows that she was connected with the forgery, and therefore they were in some degree, corroborating evidence of the character required by the Code. The section of the Code referred to does not require positive, or direct or conclusive evidence. It need only â€?tend to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.â€?Unexplained, the tendency of the evidence was to show that the check was obtained by the appellant in person upon a false pretext, and for a pretended use to which it was not put, and that, instead of being sent to Philadelphia, it was altered, and raised, and the money obtained on it within so short a time after it was obtained, as almost to preclude the possibility of its having been sent to that city; and although this alone might not justify the conviction, yet, taken with the evidence given by the accomplice of her presence at the commission of the forgery, and her sharing in its fruits, it presented a case proper to be sent to the jury, especially after her own examination had failed to explain or contradict some of the important circumstances.
The other important question is, whether the presumption of coercion by the husband required the court to take the case from the jury. The charge in the case is not given. We must presume that the court charged the jury correctly as to the law affecting the question, and as to the duty of the People to overcome presumption in favor of married women who participate with their husbands in the commission of crime.
The law on this subject as announced in Seiler v. People, (77 N. Y. 411); and Goldstein v. People (82 Id. 233), is to the effect that coverture is no protection where the wife is shown to have taken an active and willing part in the criminal act, or where she is the inciter of it, and that the fact of the husbandâ€™s presence is but prima facie evidence of coercion, which like other presumptions may be rebutted and overcome by proof. The court in determining the question of coercion had before it the whole of the testimony, including that of the accomplice, and was to act upon the probability that 'the jury would give credit to the whole, and in that view it is impossible to say that it was the duty of the court to take the case from the jury on the grounds of coverture and coercion.
There was sufficient proof, assuming that the jury gave it credit, to show that the appellant was a principal, and not a mere accessory before the fact. The evidence tended to show a confederating of several parties to take various steps intended to, and which did result in the completion of the crime. The jury had a right to find from the evidence that the participation of_ each was pre-arranged ; the appellant to procure the check which could be altered ; the husband to make the alteration; the accomplice to get the money upon it through some person, and the several parties to divide the proceeds; and to find the consummation of the object all had in view, by each doing his or her preconcerted part. We think, the question whether the appellant was an accessory or principal party was proper to be submitted to the jury, and that it was no error to refuse to. take it from them.
The result is, that the judgment should be affirmed.

1164463,PEOPLE v. BOAS,1883-03,"Brady, J.
[After stating the facts as above.]â€”There is no doubt that the defendant, as one of the inspectors, committed a grave error in refusing to accept the vote of G-erdes, and that it resulted in depriving the voter of the highest privilege he can exercise under our form of government. But the statute requires that the exclusion shall be willful, and to be willful there must exist, if not malice, a decided intention designedly and purposely to exclude the vote. To do an act willfully is to do it willingly by designâ€”â€?on purpose.â€?Worcesterâ€™s Dictionary. Such was not this case. The inspectors assigned the reason. It was not sufficient in law, it is true, but they were evidently impressed and sought advice from the chief of the bureau of elections, who suggested what he considered to be the proper mode of disposing of the controversy. He was in error, it is true, but being persons uneducated in law and perhaps not sufficiently advised of their duties as to understand them perfectly, they placed reliance upon the advice thus given, and by a person connected with the bureau of elections. This deprives the case of the essential element under the statute, of malice or deliberate design and intent, and renders it necessary to reverse the judgment pronounced against the appellant.
The learned recorder charged the jury that if they came to the conclusion that Mr. Gerdes was a legal voter, and had the legal right to vote, and that the defendant willfully excluded his vote, knowing at the time that he was duly and legally authorized to vote at that election, it was a felonious act on his part and within the meaning of that term, and that lie would be guilty of the offense charged in the indictment. This was excepted to, and the exception seems to have been well taken, because the proposition declared is that if the defendant knew that the voter was legally authorized to vote and his vote was excluded, it was willfully done. This is not justified by the evidence in the case.
The learned Recorder also charged the jury that if a majority of the board, acting as a board, the defendant being one of the majority, willfully and knowingly, all being actuated with the same common intent and motive, feloniously did exclude the vote of Gerdes, the act of one would be the act of all, or the act of the majority who concurred in excluding the vote, and that they, that is, the persons composing the majority of the board, would be jointly and severally liable, and should be convicted. This was stating the law of the case accurately, because it presented the necessary elements to justify a conviction, namely, that the defendant should be actuated by a common intent and motive feloniously to exclude the vote of Gerdes. If the intention feloniously existed, then the vote would be willfully excluded, and the appellant would be within the provisions of the statutes and liable to conviction and punishment.
The proposition which runs through the charge seems to be that if the vote was excluded, the defendant knowing that Gerdes was entitled to vote, he having the necessary qualifications and the right to do so, it was a willful act to exclude the vote, and one, therefore, which came within the provisions of the statute. This is not the law of this case, although the general proposition is correct, because it is evident that the exclusion of the vote by the appellant rested upon the proposition that some person had voted in his name, and that the inspectors thought they had no power to receive another vote, such vote having been received, although erroneously. The suggestion emanating from the inspectors to Mr. Gerdes that he should procure a mandamus seems to rest upon no other proposition than that they should be thus protected in doing what they considered would be an erroneous exercise of their duty, viz.: the receipt of the vote when one had already been given in the name of the voter presenting his ballot.
If the construction of the statute be that the mere presentation of a vote, by a person who is known to be qualified as a voter, is sufficient, under circumstances such as presented themselves in this case, to justify the conviction as an act willfully done, then there must be a departure from rules which govern cases of a kindred character and which seem to have been well settled by the adjudged cases. For example, in the case of Jenkins v. Waldron, 11 Johns. 114, it was held that an action on the case would not lie against inspectors of an election for refusing to receive the vote of a person legally qualified, without proving malice express or implied. The court said in that case: â€?It is not alleged or proved that the inspectors fraudulently or maliciously refused to receive the vote. This we consider absolutely necessary to the maintenance of an action against the inspectors of an election.â€?And in Bishop on Statutory Crimes, Â§ 806, it is stated-as a proposition in reference to the persons intrusted by law to pass upon the qualification of voters, that they are not answerable to an indictment when what they do, is done through mistake either of law or fact, being honestly done.
It must be further said that the section â€œunder which the defendant was indicted makes the exclusion of the vote a felony, and the general rule of law in regard to a felony is that there must be an intent to do wrong, and the intent must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is true that the inspectors are not invested with any discretion as to the rejection or acceptance of a vote, when the person offering it has the necessary qualifications authorizing him to express it; but the language of the statute is â€?willful.â€?It is not that if they reject the vote of a person duly qualified they may be convicted, but they must do it willfully, and that means with knowledge aforethought and with a wicked design. If this be not so, then the word willful has no force in the statute and might just as well be expunged.
For these reasons it is thought, as already suggested, that the judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered, upon which the people may be able to show from facts and circumstances, the existence of a deliberate intent or design to do wrong.
It is the determination of this court, and must be of every tribunal in the state, to preserve unconditionally and absolutely the right of a qualified voter to exercise his franchise, and to punish, whenever the facts justify it within the provisions of the statute, any departure from the strict duty of the inspectors, who in reference to the vote are the depositaries of a great public trust; and this suggests what has frequently been stated both in and out of the courts of justice, that inspectors of election should be educated and intelligent men, thoroughly instructed in the duties that they are to perform, so that when the voter presents himself they shall understand precisely the duties incumbent upon them, and thus preserve the absolute right of the voter, without interference and without impediment to express his vote, if he possesses the qualifications of the statute and is willing to take the oath required by law. It may be troublesome to make selections of such persons, but the importance of doing it results from the character of the duties to be performed as illustrated by this case, in which it is quite clear that if the inspectors had thoroughly understood their duties the vote of Gerdes would not have been excluded.
Judgment reversed and new trial ordered.

1164472,PEOPLE v. DRAPER,1882-10,"Smith, P. J.
The indictment charged that the defendant â€?in and upon Emma I. Lacey feloniously and violently did make an assault, and she the said Emma I. Lacey, then violently and against her will feloniously did ravish and carnally did know against the form of the statute,â€?etc.
The defendant demurred to the indictment on the ground that it charges two offenses in the same count, to wit, an assault and the crime of rape; and also upon the ground that the facts alleged do not constitute the crime of rape, inasmuch as it is not alleged that the woman on whom the rape was charged to have been committed, was at the time, of the age of ten years or' upwards. The demurrer was overruled, and, as we think, properly. The assault charged, was simply an element of the offense of rape. It was unnecessary to allege that the person on whom the offense was committed was of the age of ten years or upwards. The demurrer was taken under the fourth sub division of section 323 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which authorizes a demurrer when it appears on the face of the indictment that the facts stated do not constitute a crime. The facts alleged constituted the crime of rape as defined by â–?the Eevised Statutes (2 R. S. 663) whether the female was over or under the age of ten years. If over that age â€?a forcible ravishingâ€?constituted the crime; if under, â€œcarnal and unlawful knowledge â€?was enough,. and both were alleged. If it be urged that the indictment was so indefinite as that it could not be known which offense was charged, the answer is that the Criminal Code does not make indefiniteness a ground of demurrer.
â€?The defendant moved for a new trial in the court below on several grounds. The first of these is the alleged error of the court in omitting, on taking a recess for dinner, to admonish the jury as required by section 415 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. That requirement Is that â€?the jury must, also, at each adjournment of the court, whether permitted to separate or kept in charge of officers, be admonished by the court that it is their duty not to converse among themselves on any subject connected with the trial, or to form or express any opinion thereon until the cause is finally submitted to them.â€?We are inclined to think that the legislature, in adopting the enactment above quoted had in view an adjournment from day to day, or for a longer time, and not a recess taken during a single dayâ€™s session. â€œAn adjournment,â€?says Blackstone, â€œis no more than a continuance of the session from one day to another, as the word itself signifies â€?(1 Bl. Com. 186). It can hardly be supposed that the legislature intended that the admonition should be repeated whenever, during the day the trial should be suspended and the jury allowed to retire for a few minutes, as is ' often the case.
But whatever the proper construction of the section, and whatever the liability to which a court or judge may be subjected by reason of a willful violation of its provisions, we are of the opinion that an omission to give the prescribed admonition, which is the result of mere inadvertence, as this apparently was, and which is not shown to have worked harm to the defendant, is no cause for setting aside the verdict. One of the defendantâ€™s attorneys states in his affidavit that he â€?is informed and believes that the rights of the defendant were substantially prejudiced to his great injury â€?by the omission referred to, but this is a mere conclusion of the affiant, and no fact is stated on which it is based. Section 463 of the Oode of Criminal Procedure declares that a new trial can be granted by the court in which the former trial was had only in the cases provided in section 465, and an omission to admonish the jury as directed in section 415, is not one of the cases specified in section 46-5, in which a new trial may be granted.
It is contended by the appellantâ€™s, counsel that a new trial should have been granted for .the alleged misconduct of the jury in consulting law books on the crime of rape during their deliberations. It appears that the jury were out all night in charge of five officers, and that during a part of the night they were allowed to occupy the room in which the trial had been had. Van Stone, one of the officers, makes an affidavit in which he says that the jury â€?had access to law books on the crime of rape; that one and another of the jury read to the others from such books and expounded to them thereon as they supposed it to be, and contrary to the judgeâ€™s charge ; and that said reading of law so made, continued during nearly all of said night.â€?The other officer (Howard), makes affidavit that he â€?was with the jury nearly all the time that they were in said room, being out of said room only two or three times and then only a few minutes at a time, and that he heard no general talk or discussion among the jurors upon what they had read ; that he did not hear anything to make him believe that any of said jurors were influenced by anything read in any book or anything other than the evidence in the case; that none of said jurors asked for any law books, and that none were furnished to said jury or any member thereof to the knowledge or belief of deponent.â€?One of the defendantâ€™s counsel makes affidavit that he â€?is informed and believes that the defendant would not have been convicted of the crime charged had it not been for the juryâ€™s misreading and misunderstanding of the law governing the case in the jury room, and other misconduct; and that the jury came to unite in a verdict of guilty, under the false impression derived from such improper conduct, that if convicted, defendant could not be sentenced for more than five years.â€?The affiant does not give the name of his informant or the sources of his information. In the nature of the case it could only have been derived from the jurors themselves or the officers in charge. The officers are presumed to have stated all the information they possessed on the subject in their affidavits above quoted. As declarations of jurors can not be received to impeach their verdict information derived from them would be incompetent. The affidavit of counsel, therefore, is to be regarded merely as a statement of his belief on the subject and adds nothing whatever to the statements made by the officers. On the part of the plaintiff the affidavits of five of the jurors are presented for the first time on the hearing of the appeal to the effect, before the jury were taken into the room where the books were, all the jurors except the two affiants voted for conviction, and that the affiants in subsequently voting the same way and making the result unanimous were not influenced by anything read from the books. But those affidavits not having been used on the motion in the court below, are not now available to the plaintiff without the defendantâ€™s consent. The only case cited by the counsel for the prosecution in support of his motion to be allowed to read them on appeal, is Eastwood o. People (3 Park. 25); but there the affidavits used at the General Term in the first instance were read on the part of the prisoner without objection by the peopleâ€™s counsel. But upon the case as made by the affidavits of the two officers, we do not think the sessions erred in refusing a new trial. Within the limitations prescribed by sections 463 and 465, above referred to, misconduct on the part of the jury is not cause for granting a new trial unless it be such as to have prevented â€?a fair and due consideration of the case.â€?Ho misconduct is alleged on the part of the parties or of any one connected with the trial. Hone of the jurors called for books and none were furnished them. The books to which they had access had been used in court, and inadvertently left on the table, without any design that they should come to the hands of the jury. What the books were, or what were their contents on the subject of rape, does not appear. The averments of Van Stone as to what the jurors read therefrom are of the vaguest description. If his affidavit were wholly uncontradicted, it would be difficult to say, what law the jurors imbibed from the books or in what particular respect they were misled as to the law, to the defendantâ€™s prejudice. But upon the affidavit of Howard, there is no reason to suppose that any juror was influenced by what was read from the books. Before the Code of Criminal Procedure, irregularity in the conduct of a jury, when it was shown that no injury resulted to the prisoner was not ground for a new trial. In the capital case of People v. Hartung (17 How. Pr. 85 ; S. C. on appeal, 4 Park. 319, 329), the jury during their deliberations, having improperly possessed themselves of a copy of the Â¡Revised Statutes and consulted the same, it was held a mere irregularity, which, not having resulted in any actual prejudice to the prisoner was held not to have vitiated the verdict. In Bak-' er v. Simmons (29 Barb. 198), it was held by the Supreme Court in the sixth district that the verdict of a jury in a justiceâ€™s court should not be set aside simply because the constable having them in charge sought to interfere with their deliberations, and urged them to give their verdict to the prevailing party. It would have been otherwise had the act of the constable been instigated by the party. A much stronger case is that of People y. Carnal (1 Park. 256). It was a trial for murder. The constable communicated with the jury, and one of them swore that he never should have convicted the prisoner, but for what the constable communicated to them. A new trial was denied, after full argument and examination by the court. The cases cited are authority for holding that if the jury in the case before us had possessed themselves of a copy of the Revised Statutes or of any other book containing some statement of law oh the subject of rape the act, although irregular, would not have vitiated their verdict, unless it appeared that the defendant was prejudiced thereby.
There is an obvious distinction between the case at bar, and that of Mitchell v. Carter (14 Hun, 448), cited Â¡by the appellantâ€™s counsel. There the jury possessed themselves of the minutes kept by the trial judge, which contained partial and imperfect notes of the testimony, and consequently the jurors in reading them could hardly avoid getting false impressions of the facts of the case. . â€?The fact that the officers sworn to attend the jury, were in the same room with the jury during their deliberations, is not ground for granting a new trial. There is no rule in this State which prevents such practice, although it is not to be approved. People v. Hartung, 4 Park Cr. 256. The rule seems to be otherwise in Michigan. People v. Knapp, 43 Mich. 267.
The application for a new trial, on the ground of newly dis- . covered evidence, was properly denied. The affidavit upon which that branch of the motion is based, fails to show that Mary Smith, the person whose testimony is alleged to be newly discovered, is a material witness in any respect, except as it may be inferred from the fact that she was a household servant, in the employ of the father of the complainant, at the time the rape was alleged to have been committed. For aught that appears, that fact was known to the defendant before the trial. The affidavit alleges that she was not subpoenaed, for the reason that the defendantâ€™s counsel understood and supposed she would be subpoenaed in behalf of the people.
We have examined the several exceptions taken by the defendantâ€™s counsel during the trial, and it is enough to say that in the rulings to which they refer we discover no error.
The conviction and judgment should be affirmed, and the case remitted to the Court of Sessions of Orleans county, with directions to carry the same into execution.

1164493,PEOPLE v. INFIELD,1882-12,"Smyth, Recorder.
The indictment in the case contains two counts. The first count charges the defendant with having committed the crime of grand larceny- and in-the second count he is charged with having received the property alleged to have been stolen in the first count, knowing at the time he so received it, that it was stolen.
To this indictment the defendant has demurred upon the ground that more than one crime is charged therein in violation of sections 278 and 279 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Section 278 of the Code provides â€?that the indictment must charge but one crime and in one form, except as in the next section provided.â€?Section 279, which is the section referred to, provides, â€?that the crime may be charged in separate counts to have been committed by different means; and where the acts complained of may constitute different crimes, such crimes may be charged in separate counts.â€?It is clear that the legislature intended to limit the effect of section 278 by the provisions of section 279. And both sections must be considered together for the purpose of arriving at the intention of the legislature.
Prior to the adoption of the Code of Criminal Procedure it was the common practice to join in the same indictment two or more counts charging separate and distinct felonies provided that they arose out of one and the same transaction:
This rule, however, was limited by the rule of judicial discretion that on the trial of such an indictment the evidence of the prosecution should be confined to but one transaction, the differing counts being allowed only for the purpose of describing the transaction in varying ways, and while this rule was technically observed two or more felonies might be charged in one indictment.
If by such an indictment the person charged was likely to be embarrassed in his defense, the court in its discretion had the power to compel the prosecution to elect upon which count or counts he should be tried, and could also give such directions as to the verdict, that it might be known of which offense the defendant might be convicted.
An indictment might, therefore, contain one or more counts charging the defendant with embezzlement and others charging him with larceny, counts charging him with burglary and others charging him with larceny, counts charging him with forgery and others charging him with uttering the forged instrument, counts charging him with larceny and others charging him with receiving stolen property. 1 Bishop Cr. Proc. 3 ed. Â§ 449 ; Reg. v. Huntley, 8 Cox Crim. Cases, 260 ; Hawker v. People, 75 N. Y. 487.
The question presented in this case seems to me to be this ; May the acts charged in this indictment constitute the crime of larceny or that of receiving stolen goods, and this question can only be determined by the evidence which the prosecution may introduce upon the trial of the indictment.
The larceny may be established by evidence that the defendant personally feloniously took and carried away the property described in the indictment, or by showing: that he was found in the exclusive possession of the stolen property or some part of it recently after the perpetration of the larceny, without showing that the defendant actually took the property. Knickerbocker v. People, 43 N. Y. 177; Stover v. People, 56 Id. 315.
If, on the other hand, the evidence establishes the fact that the larceny charged in the first count of the indictment was committed by some person other than the defendant, and that the fruits or some part thereof were found in his possession accompanied by acts of concealment, or by showing that he purchased the stolen property at a price considerably below its value, the jury would have the right to infer in the absence of proof that he came into the possession of the property honestly and in good faith, that he received it with guilty knowledge, and convict of the crime of receiving stolen goods, and acquit of the crime of larceny.
It appearing that the acts complained of may constitute different crimes, viz., larceny and receiving stolen goods, they may properly be stated in separate counts in the same indictment.
The demurrer must therefore be disallowed with liberty to the defendant if he so elect to plead to the indictment, which he is required to do on or before the first Wednesday of the December term, and in the event of his failing to do so, and, the crime .charged being a felony, a plea of not guilty must be entered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164478,PEOPLE v. ISAACS,1883-03,"Cowing, J.
Is this statement per se a libel as against the complainant Fuller? If yes, the indictment should be sustained and judgment given for the people upon the demurrer. If no, the demurrer to the indictment should be sustained and judgment ordered for the defendant thereon.
It is an elementary principle of pleading that where the matter charged in the indictment as constituting the libel is non libelous upon its face, it is necessary to render it so by explaining its real meaning by an innuendo. The text-books and reports are full of law sustaining this principle â€? in fact, the district attorney, in his brief, cites numerous authorities sustaining it, but claims that section 289 of the Code of Criminal Procedure abolishes the rule and makes it no longer necessary to explain by means of an innuendo matter not obviously libelous. In my judgment, section 289 of Code of Criminal Procedure makes no such change in the rules of criminal pleading as is claimed by the district attorney.
Section 289 reads, â€?An indictment for libel need not set forth any extrinsic facts for the purpose of showing the application to the party libelÃ©d, of the defamatory matter on which the indictment is founded, but it is sufficient to state generally that the same was published concerning him; and the fact that it was so published must be established on the trial.â€?It will be observed that the foregoing section does not change in the least the necessity of explaining an ambiguous term, but only renders it no longer necessary to set forth any extrinsic facts for the purpose of showing the application of the libelous matter to the complainant.
The blew York Code of Civil Procedure, by section 164, dispenses with the necessity of setting out in the complaint in civil actions allegations of extrinsic facts showing the application of the defamatory matter to the plaintiff in almost the same words as are contained in section 289 of the Criminal Code, and yet Justice Willabd held, in Pike V. Van Wormer, reported in 5 How. Pr. at page 175, â€?that section 164 of the Civil Code does not dispense with the necessity of an innuendo when it becomes essential to show the meaning of the words themselves,â€?and the learned judge goes on to say that â€?the fact that the Code dispenses with the averment of extrinsic facts heretofore necessary to permit the application of the words to the plaintiff, justifies the inference that in other respects the rule formerly prevailing remains unchanged.â€?The same construction was put upon section 164 of the Civil Code, in the case of Caldwell v. Raymond (2 Abb. Pr. 196), and in my opinion the reasoning of those cases applies with greater force to the proper construction of section 289 of the Criminal Code, for it certainly will not be for a moment contended that the averments in an indictment should be less certain and specific than in a complaint. It follows from the above reasoning that an innuendo is still necessary and essential in an indictment to explain an ambiguous expression claimed to be libelous and defamatory, and that its absence in such case renders the indictment fatally defective.
Whether or not in this State (where adultery is not punished as a crime), if the averment in the indictment were that the complainant committed an abomination with defendantâ€™s wife, and that had been followed by an innuendo explaining that it was meant thereby that the complainant committed adultery with the defendantâ€™s wife, it would have rendered the averment libelous, I do not claim to decide in this opinion, for the indictment contains no such explanation. It would be clearly libelous in these States where adultery is punishable as a crime.
Let us now proceed to examine the article, or so much of the same as refers to the complainant Fuller, and see if it is libelous per se / and it must not be overlooked that we are only to examine so much of said article as may under any fair construction be considered, as matter of law, to defame the complainant.
Fuller, the complainant, is charged with committing an â€œabominationâ€?with defendantâ€™s wife. Both Worcester and Webster define the word â€?abomination â€?to mean â€?anything wicked.â€?Now, I need hardly say that there are many things which the complainant and defendantâ€™s wife may have done together which, in the estimation of a large class of the community, would be considered wicked, and therefore an â€?abomination.â€?For . instance, they may have sat down and, with great relish, eaten a savory pork tenderloin, which would be considered by some to be â€?an abomination in the sight of the Lord â– but I apprehend that no one would consider such a charge to be a criminal libel as against the complainant. Many other acts might be mentioned which would be considered wicked, and therefore â€?abominations in the sight of the Lord.â€?But one is sufficient to illustrate the absolute necessity of explaining a word so general in its meaning as â€?wicked,â€?or â€?abomination,â€?by means of an innuendo.
I can come to but one conclusionâ€”that the article set out in the indictment is not libelous per se as against the complainant, and if that part (which the People claim is so against him) has a hidden meaning which makes it so, that meaning should have been explained by means of an innuendo, which it does not do.
The demurrer is sustained, and judgment ordered for the defendant thereon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164416,PEOPLE v. McGLOIN,1883-01,"Ruger, Ch. J.
We should be quite content to rest our decision of this case upon the opinion delivered at general term, were it not a matter affecting the existence of a human life, and therefore requiring the utmost care on the part of those having charge of the administration of the law, to see that no injustice be donÃ© to the accused. These considerations have seemed to require that we should express our views fully on the material questions presented by this record, and state the reasons for the conclusions arrived at. It appears by the record, that the defendant, Michael E. McGloin, was indicted for murder in the first degree, in having caused the death of one Louis Iianier, on the morning of the 30th day of December, 1881. The indictment contained two counts, the first charging that the murder was committed while the said McGloin was engaged, with others, in the commission of the crime of burglary and felony; and the second, that the said crime of murder was committed with a deliberate and premeditated design to effect the death of said Louis Hanier. Upon the trial of this indictment at a court of General Sessions in the city- of New York, a statement proved to have been made and signed by the defendant was offered in evidence on behalf of the people, against him. It was objected by the counsel for the defendant, that this statement was inadmissible, for substantially the following reasons:
First. That it was made by the defendant under the influence of fear, produced by threats made to him by the officer in .whose custody he then was, upon a charge of committing the crime in question.
Second. Because it was taken before a magistrate after defendant was accused of, and under arrest for, the perpetration of a crime, but was not taken and authenticated in accordance with the requirements of sections 198 and 199 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Third. That it was not voluntarily made, being a sworn deposition.
The first of these objections proceeded upon the assumption that the officer effecting the arrest had threatened the prisoner, and that such threats had produced an emotion of fear in the mind, probably affecting the character of his confession. If the assumption is well founded, it will be fatal to the admissibility of the evidence, and also to the conviction in part founded thereon. The facts upon which this ground of objection rests, are as follows:
Upon making the arrest, the officer informed McGloin that he â€?was charged with shooting Louis Hanierthat he (the officer) was inspector of police, and â€?had been watching himâ€?(the prisoner) â€?since the shooting^ and saw him in company with a man named Healey, and saw him. try to steal a barrel of whiskey the night before I arrested him. I also told him about the pledging of the pistol â€?(referring to the pawning by McGloin, the day after the murder, of a pistol, with which the crime was supposed to have been perpetrated). â– â€?McGloin said he would make a statement. I said to him, I would send for'Coroner Herman to take it.â€?The coroner was then sent for, and came to police headquarters, where the defendant was in custody, and the confession in question was made, the coroner not acting in any official capacity, but as a mere clerk to take down and prove the confession. This was substantially all that occurred between the officer and the defendant previous to the making of the statement. We fail to see in this conversation the existence of any threats, or any proof from which it could be inferred that the defendant made the statement under the influence of fear.
It was held by this court in this case of People v. Wentz (37 N. Y. 303), where the defendant was in custody upon a charge of arson, that a confession drawn out by questions, and preceded by the statement made by the officer to the prisoner, â€?that he was in a bad fix, and had got caught at last,â€?was â€?wholly voluntary, and made uninfluenced by any threat, menace, promise, or other influence.â€?The case of Cox v. People (80 N. Y. 500), although a capital case, was, in respect to the inducements held out to the prisoner, similar to the'Wentz case. A confession there made by the defendant was held admissible. The court further held that it was â€?not sufficient to exclude a confession by a prisoner that he was under arrest at the time, or that it was made to the officer in whose custody he was, or in answer to questions put by him.â€?Â¡No material circumstance appears in the case at bar, which did not appear in the cases referred to, except that here the officer stated to the prisoner that he was aware of an attempt on the part of the prisoner, the night before his arrest, to steal a barrel of whiskey. It would be unreasonable to say that the defendant was moved to make this confession by fear of his exposure and punishment for the comparatively trivial crime of stealing, when he stood uninfluenced by the fact that he was in custody charged with the commission of a crime for which his life then stood in jeopardy. The argument, in short, is, that defendant might be improperly influenced to confess the commission of the crime of murder, through fear that he might be exposed and prosecuted for the crime of stealing whiskey. There is little, if any, force in it.
The question upon which the second ground of objection was based, prior to the adoption of the Code of Criminal Procedure, was the subject of some controversy and difference in the courts. Hendrickson v. People, 10 N. Y. 28; People v. McMahon, 15 Id. 385; People v. Wentz, supra; Teachout v. People, 41 N. Y. 7. The difficulty, in brief, seemed to be in determining whether the reason for the objection rested upon the theory that the evidence was given in obedience to the requirements of a subpoena, and was therefore compulsory and objectionable, as requiring a prisoner to give evidence which might criminate himself, or whether it was based upon the presumption that a prisoner giving evidence in relation to a crime, with the commission of which he is charged or suspected, gives it under such influences as produce an apprehension of danger and a mental disturbance, rendering it unjust to hold him. responsible for what he says while subjected to such influences. It was said that such evidence is not voluntary, because the mind being confused and agitated by the apprehension of danger, cannot reason with coolness, and will naturally resort to falsehood to escape the consequences of the impending danger. Hendrickson v. People, supra; People v. McMahon, supra.
The effect of these differences was to cause the line which distinguished admissible from objectionable confessions, to fluctuate according to the theory which was followed, and deprived the law of that certainty, and prisoners accused of crime of that uniformity of protection which is so essential to justice. Without discussing or referring to the authorities on this subject at length, it may be said that the following propositions were, prior to the adoption of the Criminal Code, well settled by law in this state:
1st. That all confessions material to the issue, voluntarily made by a party, whether oral or written and however authenticated, were admissible as evidence against him on a trial for a criminal offense. People v. Wentz, supra.
2d. It was no objection to the admissibility of such confessions that they had been taken under oath from a person attending before a coroner, in obedience to a subpoena,, upon an inquiry, conducted pursuant to law, into the causes of a homicide. Hendrickson v. People, supra ; Teachout v. People, supra.
3d. That the confession or declaration sought to be given in evidence, was in writing, and purported to be sworn to, was no objection to its admissibility, unless it also appeared that it was taken before a magistrate upon, a judicial investigation against the person accused of the commission of the crime.
Pabkee, J., in Hendrickson v. People, supra, said, in relation to the objection that a confession was not taken conformable to the statute, â€?But neither is the statute, nor were the common law rules, of which it is declaratory, applicable to any examination except that of a person brought before a magistrate . on a charge of crime. All other examinations are classified as extra-judicial.â€?The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, regulating the mode of taking and authenticating the statements of prisoners accused of crime, contained in sections 188-200, inclusive, refer in terms only to the judicial examinations therein provided for, regularly instituted before one of these magistrates described in section 147, for the examinations of criminals. A coroner is not one of these magistrates. There is no direct evidence in the case that the paper offered was sworn to by the defendant. Such fact is sought to be inferred, from the fact that in the body of the paper this clause is inserted: â€?The above is a true statement in every respect, to which I swear, and I make the same of my own free will.â€?And also because it purports to have been â€?taken â€?before the coroner, and is subscribed by him. These facts furnish very uncertain evidence that the defendant was sworn to such statement. The only witness who was called upon to testify on this, subject was Officer Byrnes, and he testifies positively that the defendant Ayas not sworn by the coroner. But assuming that this, paper was sworn to by McGloin, we must, within the authorities in this state, come to the conclusion that it was- in no respect, a compulsory statement, and was at common law admissible in evidence as against him on his trial.
The Code of Criminal Procedure for this state went into effect September, 1881, and contained the following provision : â€?Section 895. A confession of a defendant, whether in the course of judicial proceedings, or to a private person, can be given in evidence against him, unless made under the influence of fear produced by threats, or unless made upon a stipulation of the district attorney that he shall not be prosecuted therefor ; but it is not sufficient to warrant his conviction, without additional proof that the crime charged has been committed.â€?The crime in this case was committed after the Code took effect, and is therefore, governed by its provisions. The admissibility of the evidence in controversy, under this statute, there being no proof that the same was made either under the â€?influence of fear produced by threats,â€?or upon the stipulation referred to in the act, is beyond question. It is thus found that neither at common law, nor by the statute, was this evidence open to any of the grounds of objection raised.
One Frederick Banfield was called as. a witness by the. people on the trial, and gave material evidence against the defendant. Upon cross-examination, he testified that he had been arrested and convicted of the crime of grand larceny, and that he had been sent to the state prison for the period of eighteen months. That he was also convicted of the crime of burglary, and sentenced therefor in a court of general sessions to the penitentiary for the term of three and one-half years. No objection was taken to this testimony, neither was a motion made to strike it out on the trial. The question as to the competency of Banfield, as far as can be seen from the record, was first raised at the general term. If the question had been raised upon the trial, non constat, but that the people might have shown a pardon, and thus restored the competency of the witness. It is quite clear that no error was committed at the trial with respect to this evidence, and we might well decline to disturb the judgment on account of the objection now raised to Banficldâ€™s competency. Its consideration here is permissible only in view of that portion of section 527 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which reads as follows : â€?And the appellate court may order a new trial if it be satisfied that the verdict against the prisoner was against the weight of' evidence or against law, or that justice requires a new trial, whether any exception shall have been taken or not in the court below.â€?The plaintiff in error would seem to have no legal right to a review of this question in this court. Inasmuch as Banfield gave important ' and material evidence against the defendant, which might, and probably did, influence the finding of the jury; if for any reason such evidence could be legally excluded on a new trial, it might possibly be claimed that justice in his case required such trial. It therefore becomes competent for us to examine the validity of the objection now raised to Banfieldâ€™s competency. It is claimed that Banfield was rendered incompetent to testify as a witness in the case, by virtue of the provisions of section 43, title 7, 3d vol. of the Revised Statutes, Banksâ€?6th ed., the essential portions of which read as follows:
â€?No person sentenced upon a conviction for felony shall be competent to testify in any cÃ¡use, matter or proceeding, civil or criminal, unless he be pardoned by the Governor or by the Legislature, except in the cases specially provided by law.â€?It is claimed that section 832 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which was in force at the time of the commission of this crime, and which read as follows: â€œA person who has been convicted of a crime or misdemeanor is, notwithstanding, a competent witness in a civil or criminal action, or special proceeding, but the conviction may be proved for the purpose of affecting the weight of his testimony, either by the record or by his cross-examination, upon which he must answer any question relevant to that inquiry ; and the party cross-examining him is not concluded by his answer to such a question,â€?does not restore the competency of the witness, because the disqualification imposed by the foregoing section of the Eevised Statutes, follows only upon a â€?sentence based upon a conviction for a felony,â€?whereas the subsequent enabling statute embodied in' section 832 of the Code of Civil Procedure, relieves only those who have been disqualified by a conviction of a crime or misdemeanor, leaving, as it is claimed, those who have been tried, convicted and sentenced, still subject to the exclusion pronounced by the Eevised Statutes. It is hardly conceivable that this construction can be seriously urged. Both at common law and by statute, a witness becomes disqualified, only after sentence rendered upon a conviction for felony. People v. Whipple, 9 Cow. 707; People v. Herrick, 13 Johns. 82.
When it is considered that a mere conviction, not followed by a sentence, never worked a disability, it will be seen that the construction contended for by the plaintiff in error would deprive section 832 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as well as section 714 of the Penal Code, of any meaning or effect whatsoever. One of the most familiar rules for the construction of statutes requires not only that some effect should be given to all acts of the Legislature, if capable of such interpretation, but that effect must be given, if possible, to all of the language employed. Hew York & Brooklyn Bridge, 72 N. Y. 527. The language used in section 832 to describe the object intended to be accomplished, is that which has obtained invariable usage, not only in the reports, but with text writers, and is there used according to' the signification given to it by legal writers. It was, therefore, an accurate legal description of such a disqualification to say that it is produced by a conviction of a felony. It is the depravity of nature evidenced by the conviction, that creates the disability; and is the only cause of that disability. â€?It is the infamy of the crime, and not the nature of the punishment, which destroys competency.â€?1 Whartonâ€™s Crim. L. Â§ 760.
While the terms â€?disqualified by a sentence for crime â€?or similar words are never found in the text-books or reports, the language used in section 832 is invariably employed to describe the disability referred to. Jackson v. Osborn 2 Wend. 555; 13 Johns. 82, supra ; Hilts v. Colvin, 14 Johns. 182.
The disqualification, though entirely based upon the conviction, yet in order to preclude the,possibility that the conviction may have been nullified by a motion in arrest or other proceeding, is by the Eevised Statutes required to be followed by a sentence in order to become effectual. There is not one disqualification produced by a conviction, and another by a sentence, but both conviction and sentence together produce one and the same disqualification. The removal of the cause of â€¢disqualification necessarily restores the competency of the witness, without reference to the fact as to whether he was sentenced or not. It was evidently the intention of the Legislature to remove the disqualification in question, and it is our duty in construing this statute, to give effect to that intention. From the irreconcilable repugnancy which exists between these acts, the inference inevitably follows, that the provisions of the Eevised Statutes were intended to be repealed by the enactment â€¢of the Code of Civil Procedure. We are therefore of the opinion that no reason exists for granting a new trial upon this ground.
Notwithstanding the admission of the confession of McGfloin in evidence against him, it is still required by section â€?95 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in order to warrant his â€¢conviction, â€?that additional proof that the crime charged has been committed,â€?should be given. Without undertaking to state the evidence in detail, it will be sufficient to refer to the several prominent facts which the evidence outside of the admissions contained in his confession either proved or tended to prove. The proof showed that, previous to his murder, one Louis Hanier lived in a two-story frame dwelling on West Twenty-sixth street, in the City of New York .; that the lower part of said house was used for a bar-room and restaurant, with a hall adjoining; that the upper part of said house was occupied as a dwelling by said Hanier and his family, and communicated with the lower part of the house by a stairway running into the hall, and from the hall, by a doorway opening into the barroom ; there were two modes of entrance into the house : one from the street, by a doorway opening into the bar-room, and another by a door opening into the hall. On the morning of December 30, 1881, about the hour of two oâ€™clock, Louis Hanier, standing on the stairway leading from the upper to the lower stories of said house, and being at the time about three steps from the top of the stairway, was fatally shot by a pistol or revolver in the hands of some person standing in the doorway, between the bar-room and the hall, at the foot of the stairway; that said Hanier died about three minutes after said shooting, in consequence of the wound thereby occasioned. It was in proof that Hanier had closed and locked up his saloon about the hour of one oâ€™clock, and had retired to rest. That he was awakened by his wife, who had heard a noise in the saloon below, and started in his night-shirt to investigate the cause of said noise, when he was shot as described. It was testified by a policeman, that after Hanier had closed up his saloon and retired, he (the policeman) tried the front doors of the house, and found them both securely fastened. It was further shown that there was a back door to the saloon, opening into a back yard, which they were accustomed to fasten at night on closing up the saloon. It was also shown that, immediately after the shooting, the front door of the saloon was found open.
About eleven oâ€™clock of the night of the homicide, the defendant, Michael E. McGloin, redeemed a pistol which he had in pawn with one Gooley, on West Thirteenth street, then supposed to be loaded, and took it away with him; that said Mc-Gloin, some time on the morning of December 30, 1881, in company with several other persons, left a package containing a revolver with one Charles E. Graves, who keeps a saloon on West Fifty-seventh street in Hew York, and asked him to keep the same for him ; that on the morning of the said 30th day of December, McGloin again obtained said pistol, and at about eleven oâ€™clock a. m. of that day, pledged it for a small loan with one Bernard Eosenthal, who keeps a pawnbroker shop at Ho. 362 Hintli avenue, in Hew York city.
This pistol was found through the admissions contained in McGloinâ€™s confession, and was acknowledged by McGloin to be the pistol with which Louis Hanier was shot.
It was farther proved, by Frederick Banfield, that he saw McGloin about half past ten oâ€™clock of the morning of said 30th of December, and had the following conversation with him: â€?â€?I asked him,â€?says Banfield, â€?if on the night before, he was out. He said, â€?Y es.â€?I told him there was a man killed around Twenty-sixth street; I asked him if he was around Twenty-sixth street the night before ; he said, â€?Yes.â€?Then he said to me, 1A man ainâ€™t a tough until he knocks his man out.â€?â€?This evidence we think not only tended to prove, aside from Mc-Gloinâ€™s confession, that a burglary was committed upon the dwelling of Louis Hanier on the morning of December 30,1881, but also tended to establish the fact that Louis Hanier was unlawfully killed in the course of the commission of such burglary, and that the defendant was a principal in the commission of both such crimes. We are therefore of the opinion that there was sufficient corroboration of the confession of the defendant, McGloin, to warrant his conviction of the crime of murder in the first degree. The confession of the defendant also tends to prove, not only his active participation in the commission of the burglary, but the fact that he fired the shot which killed Louis Hanier. If we consider the confession in connection with the other proofs given on the trial, it tends to establish the fact that the crime in question was committed under circumstances of great atrocity, indicating on the part of the perpetrator a wanton and reckless disposition, and a depraved and dangerous character. They together, unquestionably furnished sufficient evidence to justify a jury in finding the defendant guilty of the murder of Louis Hanier under both counts of the indictment.
The conclusions at which we have arrived, as to the competency of the evidence objected to, as well as the legal effect of .all the evidence in the case, render it unnecessary to examine at length the several exceptions taken to the charge of the recorder by the counsel for the plaintiff in error. Three exceptions are brought to our attention by the brief of the counsel. The first is an exception to the refusal of the recorder to charge as follows: â€?That in order to convict under the first count of the indictment, the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, 1st. A burglary or larceny was committed-by the prisoner; 2d. That while so engaged in the commission of either or both ' of said offenses, the prisoner killed the deceased. Before the jury can consider the proposition as to the killing whilst in the perpetration of a felony they must find that there was evidence, exclusive of the confession of the prisoner, that the felony had been committed; that the prisonerâ€™s alleged confession is not sufficient to warrant the jury in finding affirmatively that the offense of burglary, or grand larceny, or both of said offenses had been committed, without additional proof on the subject.â€?If there were any erroneous propositions included in this complex request, the refusal to charge as requested was properly made. It will be seen by the first clause of the request that the Recorder is asked to charge the jury, that they cannot find the defendant guilty of any crime thereunder, unless they also find the existence of the several elements constituting the crime of murder in the first degree. In other words, that no conviction eould*he had under saidâ€?count, except for murder in the first degree. In fact it was competent for the jury to convict the prisoner of the crime of manslaughter, or any inferior degree, under that count, and without reference to the truth or existence of several of the facts described in the request. The second clause of such request is based upon the alleged inadmissibility of the confession of McGIoin. As we have seen, that assumption was incorrect, and this part of the request was therefore erroneous. The last clause of this request was actually charged by the Recorder, immediately after the refusal to charge, above referred to. The exception to the refusal to charge as requested was therefore not well taken. The exceptions to the refusal of the court to charge the jury as matter of law, upon the evidence, that they could not convict the prisoner of murder in 'the first degree under the first count of the indictment; and also the exception to the refusal of the court to charge the same with reference to the second count, were neither of them well taken, inasmuch as we have held the evidence to be sufficient to justify the jury in finding the defendant guilty under both counts. Upon the whole case, wre are satisfied that the verdict was neither against the weight of evidence nor against law ; that the . trial was conducted in substantial conformity with the rules of law, and that the result was such as the jury might properly reach upon the evidence. We do not think that justice requires a new trial, but on the contrary, that it leads us to an affirmance of this conviction.
The judgment is therefore affirmed.

1164455,PEOPLE v. WARE,1883-03,"Daniels, J.
The evidence tended to show that three men, of whom the defendant probably was one, entered the laundry of the complaining witness, who is a Chinaman, and by threats and force robbed him of his money. After the case was rested by the people, the defendant ivas sworn as a witness in his own behalf, and he was asked the following questions: â€?Now, on the 19th day of October, this last October, did not you enter the premises, 155 Forsyth street, together with two other men, at eleven oâ€™clock at night, and did not you and those men present a pistol at the head of a Chinaman by the name of Hong Wah?â€?A. â€œNo, Sir.â€?Q. â€œOne momentâ€”did not you and the other men rob him of $70?â€?A. â€œNo, sir.â€?Q. â€œNo?â€?A. â€œNo, sir.â€?After the defense had concluded its evidence, the district attorney proposed and ivas allowed, against the defendantâ€™s objection and exception, to show that he, witness, saw the defendant, Ware, at his laundry in Forsyth street, at eleven oâ€™clock; he ivas accompanied by Ã­avo other men; that, after entering the laundry, Ware pointed a pistol at his head, the other men pulled in the windows and locked the door; he Avas then tied up, and they took from under his pillow a roll of bills, amounting to $70, and $5 in silver out of the drawer, his property, and left; the men were all strangers to Avitness.
In the argument made on behalf of the people, an effort has been made to justify the admission of this evidence on the ground of its supposed pertinency to disclose the intention of the defendant in the commission of the acts alleged against him in the indictment. But the cause did not require this evidence for that purpose, for it Avas entirely apparent that the persons who entered the place of the complaining witness and robbed him of his money, intended to commit precisely that crime. But even if the evidence might have been pertinent on the question of intent, it Avas neither offered nor received on that theory. The ruling of the court, under which it was permitted to be given, was expressed in the following language: The Court : â€?I shall charge the jury that the fact, if it be a fact, that Ware committed another offense on the 19th day of October, is no evidence whatever tending to prove that he committed the offense charged in the indictment, but that they may take that circumstanceâ€”that is, the contradiction between him and this witness, as I assume it is going to be a contradictionâ€?into consideration upon the question of the defendantâ€™s credibility as a witness. That is the extent, of it.â€?And from that it is clear that the evidence was received for the mere purpose of contradicting and discrediting the defendant.as a witness in the case. Whether he participated in the commission of the other offense was not a material inquiry on the trial of this indictment. It was simply collateral, and the object of it was by cross-examination to show such preceding criminal conduct on the part of the defendant as would lead the jury to disbelieve the witness or to reduce the effect they might otherwise be inclined to give to his testimony. When that course of cross-examination has been followed, the law does not permit the party adopting it to introduce further and independent evidence to .prove that the denial of the witness was false. When that is the sole effect to be given to the evidence, the party cross-examining the witness is concluded by his answer. The inquiry cannot be further extended by procuring testimony of a contradictory nature. The rule upon this subject has frequently been made a matter of consideration by the courts, and it is now well established that to entitle the party interrogating the witness in this manner, by way of cross-examination, to introduce evidence to contradict his statements, the cross-examination must be directed to a material inquiry in the case, or to evidence establishing a hostile or unfriendly bias, against the party, in the mind of the witnesses. Carpenter v. Ward, 30 N. Y. 243, 245; Plato v. Reynolds, 27 Id. 586 ; First Baptist Church v. Brooklyn Fire Ins. Co., 28 Id. 153; Chapman v. Brooks, 31 Id. 75, 87; Stokes v. People, 53 Id. 164, 175-6; Schultz v. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 89 Id. 243.
The evidence which was received concerning the commission of the other offense was in direct contravention of this rule. By the ruling of the court it was taken for no other or different purpose, and it is to be presumed that it was only used as it was stated by the court it would be, in the consideration and determination of the case. This was a material error which could not be otherwise than prejudicial to the case of the defendant.

1164501,PEOPLE v. FULLE,1883-05,"Rufus B. Cowing, City Judge.
This case comes to the General Sessions on an appeal from a judgment of the Special Sessions. The complaint upon which the defendant was tried and convicted in the court below charged him with selling adulterated cream of tartar for a drug and food for the use of man, in violation of chapter 407 of the Laws of 1881, entitled: â€œAn act to prevent the adulteration of food or drugs.â€?Upon the trial the prosecution was compelled to and did elect to try the defendant on so much of the charge in the complaint as accused the defendant of selling the article in question as a drug, and upon this charge the defendant was tried and convicted, and sentenced to pay a fine of ten dollars.
The defendantâ€™s counsel claims that the conviction and judgment entered thereon is erroneous and illegal, and upon his argument before this court relies upon four different grounds for a reversal of the judgment.
1. That a printed volume called the United States Pharmacopoeia was improperly received in evidence.
2. That there is no evidence in the case of any sale of cream of tartar as a drug.
3. That there is no evidence in the case of any criminal intent, or of such criminal negligence as in law supplies the place of the criminal intent.
4. That the law under which the defendant was convicted is unconstitutional and void.
One of the objects of the complaint like as indictment, is to inform the defendant of the accusation made against him, that he may know what he is called upon to defend himself against, and be prepared on his trial to meet, and there can be no question that where the evidence fails to establish the charge in the complaint, the defendant should be acquitted, and it is also true that any material variance between the material allegations in the complaint and the proof is fatal to a conviction; nor can a defendant be charged and tried for one offense and be convicted of another and entirely different offense. I consider all these propositions elementary, and as so many legal axioms. Did the defendant, as alleged, willfully or negligently sell adulterated cream of tartar as a drug? If he did, he has violated the law. â€¢As appears from the record, in my judgment, the plain, uncontradicted evidence establishes the following facts:
â–?1. That neither the article in question, nor any part of it, * was composed of cream of tartar, but was sold under that name.
2. That the defendant at the time of the sale was not a druggist, but was a grocer, and carried on a business pertaining to a grocer.
3. That the defendant did not sell drugs or medicines as such in his grocery business.
4. That the defendant did not manufacture this article in question, but purchased it from one James E. Armstrong as a pure article, as and for the best in the'market, and for which he paid the highest market price.
5. That defendant tried to obtain the best of cream of tartar, and believed that he had done so.
6. That the defendant sold the cream of tartar in question in the regular course of his business as and for an article of food.
If I am correct in supposing that all the foregoing facts are clearly established by the plain, uncontradicted evidence in the case, then it follows, in my judgment, that the conviction of the defendant was clearly wrong, for the following reasons :
There was a fatal variance between the complaint and the proof, the complaint alleging that the defendant sold the article in question as a drug, while the evidence clearly established that he sold it as an article 'of food. The primary, if not the only, object of the law is the preservation of the public health, and it seeks in one way to do this by prohibiting the sale of adulterated food or drugs for the use of man, but where either food or drugs are sold for other and different purposes and uses, the object of the law is not contravened.
Now, Dr. Chandler, in his article in Johnson's Cyclojpoedia on cream of tartar, gives some of the uses of the same, and among them the doctor says it may be used as a mordant for dyeing. If I understand the learned counsel for the people aright, he claims that if the complaint had charged that the defendant had sold this cream of tartar as an article of food, which it is, and the nroof established that he sold it as and for a mordant for dyeing, that nevertheless he could be properly convicted under such a complaint for a violation of the law, for, says the learned counsel for the people, cream of tartar is an article of food, and in this case it was adulterated and sold by the defendant, and this would be sufficient to sustain a conviction under the law, irrespective of the fact that the complaint charged the sale as and for food for man, while the proof established that he sold it for an entirely different purposeâ€”to wit, as and for a mordant for dyeing. In my judgment, the rules of criminal pleading would not sanction a conviction under such circumstances, but the variance between the allegation and the proof would be fatal to a conviction.
The third ground urged by the defendantâ€™s counsel why the judgment should be vacated and set aside requires a construction of the statute under which the defendant was convicted. So far as the letter of the statute is concerned, it is made a crime for one to sell adulterated food or drugs, irrespective of his intent; but it is claimed by defendantâ€™s counsel that a fair and just construction of the act not only requires proof of the sale of an adulterated article, but also that the sale was made with a criminal intent, or under circumstances of such negligence as in law supplies the place of the criminal intent; and in this claim, in my judgment, the counsel for the defendant is right. Bishop, in his admirable work on Criminal Law, seventh edition, in section 287,. says:
â€?The doctrine which requires an evil intent lies at the foundation of public justice. There is only one criterion by which the guilt of men is to be tested. It is whether the mind is criminal. And neither in philosophical speculation nor in religious or moral sentiment would any people, in any age, allow that a man should be deemed guilty unless his mind was so. It is, therefore, a principle of our legal system, as probably it is of every other, that the essence of an offense is the wrongful intent, without which it cannot exist.â€?But he holds that under some circumstances the negligent manner with which an act is done may be so gross as to supply the place of the required criminal intent. And again, at sections 303 and 304, the same learned commentator on the criminal law says: â€?All statutes are to be, and constantly are interpreted with reference to the unwritten law, by the principles of which they are limited and extended, so as to preserve harmony in our judicial system, and promote justice.â€?â€?Since an evil intent is an indispensable element in every crime, any such mistake of fact as happening to one honestly endeavoring to discharge all legal and social duties, shows the act complained of to have proceeded from no love of evil in the mind, takes from it its indictable quality.â€?â€?A mistake of fact, neither induced nor accompanied by a fault or omission of duty, excuses the otherwise criminal act which it prompted.â€?In iny judgment, the foregoing legal doctrine enunciated by Bishop in his book on Criminal Law, is unanswerable, and, construing and interpreting this statute in question by the law as laid down by Bishop, it follows that before a person can be convicted of a crime for its violation, it will be necessary to establish either that he was actuated by a criminal intent or was guilty of such negligence in the doing of the act as will supply the place of the criminal intent.
Does the evidence returned in the record in this case show such criminal intent or criminal negligence in the doing of the act charged as to constitute a crime and the defendant a criminal ? There is no positive and direct evidence showing a â€¢willful and intentional violation of the statute, ifor does there seem to me to be any evidence going to show that the defendant was criminally negligent in selling the cream of tartar; on the contrary, on reading the evidence, I can come to no other conclusion but that the defendant was desirous of observing â€¢the law, and that in all that he did he acted the part of a careful and prudent man. He purchased the efeam of tartar from a dealer, in open' market. Before doing so, he inquired for the best article, and was told by the dealer that that purchased was the best. He paid the highest market price for the same, and believed that he was purchasing a pure article, and the best. He bought it for a pure article and sold it for the same, believing it to be pure.
I think the evidence comes very far short of making the defendant a criminal. At most, the evidence shows, in my opinion, that the sale of the cream of tartar, under all the circumstances, was an honest mistake of fact, without fault on the part of the defendant, which in law excused him.
For the foregoing reasons, I think the judgment of the Special Sessions was wrong, and- should be vacated and set aside, and the defendant granted a new. trial, and it is so ordered.
Note.â€”Although the doctrine of this case is supported by the great authority of Mr. Bishop (1 Bishop Crim. Law, 7 ed. Â§Â§ 301-304, 303 a, and note; Bishop Statutory Crimes, 2 ed. Â§Â§ 1124-1126), and by sound principle, the authorities holding that in such a case ignorance of fact does not excuse are very numerous.
A long list of them is given in 30 American Rep. 617, nÃ³te. See also, to the same effect, Reg. v. Prince, 2 L. R. C. C. R. 154; 13 Monk's English Rep. 385; Redmond v. State, 36 Ark. 58; 38 Amer. Rep. 24, and the most recent case, Commonwealth v. Evans, 132 Mass. 11. The doctrine 'that ignorance does not excuse, is well established in Massachusetts. Commonwealth v. Farren, 9 Allen, 489; Commonwealth v. Nichols, 10 Allen, 199; Commonwealth v. Waite, 11 Allen, 264.
In an English case, Reg. v. Bishop, 5 L. R. Q. B. 259; 29 Monk's English Rep. 283, the defendant was convicted under 8 & 9 Vict. c. 100, Â§ 44, of receiving lunatics into her house, not being a registered asylum or hospital, duly licensed under the above act, or any previous act. Held., that the belief of the defendant, on honest and reasonable grounds, that the persons so received were not lunatics, was no defense.
In reference to this case Sir James F. Stephen says; â€?I held, and the court for crown cases reserved upheld my holding, that it was immaterial whether the defendant knew that her patients were lunatics or not, as the legislature intended persons keeping such establishments to receive patients at their peril. Tim appeared from the general scope of the act, and from the nature of the evils to be avoided, and I am not aware of any other way in which it is possible to determine whether the word â€?hnowingly â€?is or is not to be implied in the definition of a crime in which it is not expressed. â€?2 History of the Criminal Law of Rngland, 117.
As supporting the doctrine of the principal case, see Farrell v. State, 32 Ohio, 456; 30 Amer. Rep. 614; Faulks v. People, 39 Mich. 200; 33 Amer. Rep. 374.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164456,PEOPLE v. CUTLER,1883-12,"Gilbert, J.
With respect to the technical objections to the judgment appealed from, it will be sufficient to refer to section 761 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Upon the merits we think the evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction. The statute (Code Crim. Proc. Â§ 899, subd. 4 and 7) defines disorderly persons, and among the persons so defined, are keepers of houses for the resort of gamesters, and persons who keep in a public place an apparatus or device for the purpose of gaming. The evidence shows that the defendant kept a public saloon, to which persons resorted for the purpose of playing a game called pool, and another game called bagatelle.
These games were sometimes played upon the terms that the loser of the game should pay for the use of the gaming apparatus ; but, at other times, the players played for drinks. The house of the defendant, as appears, was kept principally for those purposes. Such a house is a public nuisance at common law (Tanner v. Trustees of Albion, 5 Hill, 121), and persons who resort there are gamesters, within the definition of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
In Hitchins v. People (39 N. Y. 456), the Court of Appeals held that, playing games for beer or cigars, was gambling, within the meaning of chapter 504 of the Laws of 1851, which prohibited the keeping of a room, etc., to be used for gambling.
That case was in accordance with general principles for the promotion of the public welfare, and is decisive of the case.
The conviction must be affirmed.

1164431,PEOPLE v. HOVEY,1883-03,"Brady, J.
The defendant was indicted and convicted of murder in the first degree for killing his sister-in-law, Fannie Yermilyea, April 20, 1882. At the time of the killing the deceased and the appellant occupied different apartments on the same floor of a boarding-house, situate at No. 273 West Thirty-eighth street, in this city. On the night preceding the homicide the deceased took from the defendant a pistol which he was in the habit of carrying, and hid it. At this time his child, who was an infant, was seriously ill with the scarlet fever.
On the following morning,â€”i. e. the day of the killing,â€”the defendant, in the presence of the deceased, wanted his wife to wash his feet, when the deceased said to him, â€?Eddie, you ought to have more thought for your dying baby ; â€?to which he replied, â€?Youâ€™re getting too God damned high-toned.â€?He soon after left the house, but returned at about one oâ€™clock in the afternoon for dinner, having taken which he again left, and sometime during the afternoon went to a pawnbrokerâ€™s shop, where he pawned his coat, purchased a pistol, loaded it, and, returning to his house, went to the room of the deceased and shot her, the ball passing through the lung, and death ensuing within a few minutes. This occurred about twenty-five minutes after his return. He then went out into the hallway connected with the room, where he was seen by another sister of his wife,â€”namely Sophia McCullough,â€”who having been called as a witness testified that having heard the shot she asked him what he had done ; to which he responded, â€œNothing,â€?although the pistol was still in his hand. She further testified that he then went into her sisterâ€™s room again, and she ordered him out; whereupon he went across the hall to his own room where his sick child was lying. The witness then requested him not to touch the baby; to which he responded, alluding to the witness, â€?You little son of a bitch, if you donâ€™t get out of this room I will kill yon too.â€?It appears further from the testimony of Mrs. Byrnes, that her attention was directed to the shooting by the request of the deceased, â€?Mrs. Byrnes, save me! â€?Whereupon she ran â–?to her and caught her in her arms. While she was thus holding the deceased, the prisoner was brought into her presence, when the witness said to him, â€?Look what you have done ! â€?and he laughed. This was at a moment when the deceased was â€œjust departing,â€?to use the language of the witness, and he was in the custody of the officerâ€”indeed had walked over the dead feet of the deceased, as the witness stated. The laugh seems to have been the only indication of his consciousness of the observation which was made to him by the witness.
The officer who arrested him, at the time of his arrest and in the house where the shooting took place, asked him if he was the man who did the shooting ; to which he said, â€?Yes.â€?As they passed over the body of the deceased he said to him, â€?Is that the woman you shot ? â€?And the prisoner answered â€œYes.â€?The officer further asked him, â€?Is that [exhibiting it] the pistol you shot her with % â€?To which he replied â€?Yes,â€?saying in addition, â€?And if I'had another bullet in that pistol you never would have taken me from that room.â€?The officer further testified that having taken him to the station-house, the sergeant asked if he shot the woman, to which he replied, â€?Yes.â€?The sergeant then further asked, â€?What did yon shoot the woman for % â€?And the answer was that that was liis. business and not the sergeantâ€™s.
Upon this testimony:â€”the effect of which the appellant essayed to overcome by his story,which was that the shooting was accidentalâ€”the jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree.
There was evidence on the part of the defense to show, doubtless to account for the possession of it, that from his boyhood it had been the habit of the defendant to carry a pistol. It will have been observed from this statement of the case that no witness was called who saw the shooting, except the defendant, who committed the deed, and therefore the importance of the circumstances mentioned must impress itself at once upon' the mind upon the question of premeditation and deliberation, which were necessary elements to establish the guilt of the appellant to the extent pronounced by the verdict herein.
On the night preceding the killing, as we have already seen, the deceased took the defendantâ€™s pistol and hid it, and no doubt from a good motive. It is true he says he was in the habit of giving her his pistol at night, and this necessarily involved the ceremony of returning it to him upon the following day; but on this occasion the pistol was not returned, it was hid. It is a slight circumstance, it is true, but unfortunately for the viciously inclined, the history of crime shows that violent deeds are sometimes committed upon very slight provocation.
In addition to this circumstance, however, as we have seen, the appellant wished his wife to wash his feet, and at a time which, in consequence of the severe illness of his child, and who died the next day, seems to have been most solemn. The deceased reminded him of that fact by saying, â€?Eddie, you ought to have more thought for your dying baby,â€?an observation with which he was evidently displeased, because, as we have already seen, his answer was, â€?You are getting too God damned high-toned.â€?The hiding of the pistol and the observation of the deceased appear to have been proper in themselves, and not calculated to produce very great excitement. They seem, however, to have aroused within him a malevolent sentiment, a passion for revenge, which was to be appeased only by slaughter. Unless we accept his story that the shooting was accidental, no other view can be taken of the occurrence.
It was the- feeling suggested that induced him to pawn his coat and to buy the pistol and load it. It is proper to observe here, that there is no evidence in the case, showing that he was engaged in a calling which required such a weapon for his protection, or that he was in imminent danger in any respect, and, therefore, the loading of the pistol in the pawnbrokerâ€™s shop, marked by the preceding circumstances to which reference has been made, must have been with an object, and that object was the killing of the deceased, and was carried into execution within a few hours after the purchase of the pistol. â–?The causes which led to the act are trivial, it is true, when judged by the ordinary standard of human action, but in a bad-tempered man, a person easily excited, quickly inflamed, destitute of a decent sense of propriety, and more particularly if a criminal by habit, they might be, and indeed in this case seem to have been, quite sufficient to instigate the crime of which the defendant was convicted. That he was a criminal by habit, or, if the word habit is not justifiable, that he was a criminal at all events, is shown by his cross-examination, for, when he was .asked how often he had been in prison, he said three times, and each time for stealing.
The jury took all these circumstances into consideration, and the fact also that the defendantâ€™s wife was present when the deceased was shot, and could have been called as a witness on his behalf. He failed, to call her to corroborate, if she could do so, his statement as to the shooting being accidental. It is impossible for us to say, therefore, under all the facts and circumstances to which reference has been made, that the jury were not entirely justified in finding the prisoner guilty of murder in the first degreeâ€”premeditated and deliberate murder.
The learned judge, in charging the jury, said : â€?There is no eye-witness who has testified to the occurrence, except the defendant. The people claim, however, and the uncontradicted evidence established that there was another eye-witness to this occurrence, namely, the wife of the defendant. You remember when the wife was offered as a witness, on behalf of the people, the court would not allow her to be examined as a witness against her husband, for in my judgment, the law does not permit it, but while that is so, the law does allow the wife to be a witness in her husbandâ€™s behalf, and the people claim, that inasmuch as it appeared in evidence, that she was an eye-witness to the occurrence, accessible to the defendant, and the defendant allowed by the law to call her as his witness, and having neglected to do so, that that is a circumstance which the jury have a right to consider, on coming to a conclusion. And the people claim, moreover, that the prisonerâ€™s omission to call her as witness under the above circumstances, should be taken as a matter of evidence against him, and they claim that the fair presumption is, that if she was called, her testimony would not be favorable to the defendant.â€?No exception was taken to the observations thus quoted, but after the verdict of guilty had been rendered, and at a sitting of the court upon the 29th of September, 1882, when the appellant was arraigned for sentence, a motion was made for a new trial: First. Upon the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence; and, Secondly. That there was not sufficient evidence in the case to show that the act was the result of a premeditated and deliberate design to effect death. And the counsel for the defendant, in connection with these two grounds, urged the error which it was alleged had been committed by the learned judge presiding, in making the observations which have been quoted. The application was made under section 527 of the Code, which provides that in cases of this character, tried in the Court of General Sessions, the appellate court may order a new trial, if it be satisfied that the verdict against the prisoner is against the weight of evidence, or against law, or that justice requires a new trial, whether any exceptions shall have been taken or not in the court below. In the consideration of this case, the appellant should, therefore, be given the full benefit of this section.
The question of premeditation has already been discussed, as will have been seen, and a result arrived at unfavorable to him, and the disposition of it in the court below sustained. The verdict was not against the weight of evidenceâ€”there was sufficient proof that the killing was the result of a premeditated and deliberate design to effect death.
No error seems to have been committed, either by the remarks of the learned judge, in reference to the omission of the defendant to call his wife as a witness. It will have been perceived, that in .commenting upon this circumstance, the learned judge merely repeated the claim made on behalf of the people,namely, that the prisonerâ€™s omission to call her as a witness, under the circumstances disclosed in the charge, should be taken as matter of evidence against him; that the fair presumption was, that, had she been called, her testimony would not have been favorable to him. It was not asserted as a conclusion of law, that such a result must follow, or that such must be the consideration given to the circumstance by the jury, but a state-' ment, merely, of the claim put forth by the prosecution of the argument on behalf of the peopleâ€”that the omission was one which should be regarded by the jury as prejudicial to the pris-' oner. The facts affecting it are, that his wife was in court, and ..that she was called as a witness by the prosecution, but excluded upon the objection of the prisonerâ€™s counsel. It seems to have been conceded that she was present at the time of the shooting, and, therefore, could have stated the circumstances attending the act. The charge is clearly within the rule of law as enunciated by the adjudged cases.
In the case of Gordon v. People, 33 N. Y. 508, it was held, that when one accused of the crime of murder was required to account for his whereabouts at' a particular time, to avoid the force of criminating circumstances, his omission to produce the evidence is not conclusive of the facts in dispute, but the force of such circumstances may be left for the consideration of the jury. The absence of such evidence, the court said, especially when it seems to be in the power of the prisoner to furnish it, creates a strong presumption of his guilt, a strong inference against him, and is a circumstance greatly corroborative of the truth of the evidence given upon the other side, and, in a doubtful case, would justify the jury in resolving the doubt against him.
The case of Gordon v. People is cited with approbation, and the rule is substantially reiterated in the case of Bleecker v. Johnston, 69 N. Y. 309. See also Brooks v. Steen, 6 Hun, 517 ; also the case of People v. Tweed, 5 Hun, 387, in which the learned judge, in discussing the subject, said, that the omission to furnish an affidavit denying the facts upon which an order of arrest was founded, rendered if probable that he could not truthfully do it, and the effect of it was to increase the force of the circumstances disclosed, as well as the probability that the statements made by two of his accomplices as to what really did take place, and the court then states the rule declared in the case of People v. Gordon, supra.
Under these circumstances, and in view of these authorities, it is quite clear that no error was committed by the learned judge in simply stating to the jury the claim made on behalf of the people, without telling them the effect of it, and without in any way expressing any opinion about it, presenting it, as he did, for the consideration of the jury, and leaving it entirely with them to determine its weight and effect.
It is said on behalf of the appellant, that the presumption must be that his wife was hostile to him, and that he was not, therefore, obliged to use her as a witness, or to be subjected to any. criticism because he did not call her. This view is fallacious. The presumption is that she would tell the truth, and the appellant must take the consequences of such presump-tion.
It is also urged that under section 2 of the Law of 1876 chapter 182, it was optional with the wife whether she would become a witness or not on behalf of her husband, that act depending upon her own will, and being free from any control of her husband. This view is predicated of this language of the section: â€?In all criminal trials and examinations before trial, a husband or wife may be examined as a witness on behalf of the other,â€â€”but it is clearly erroneous. The legislature meant to confer, and did so, upon the husband the privilege, in a criminal proceeding against' him, of calling his wife as a witness, if he chose to do soâ€”not to give her any other right than to call him, if she chose to do so, under similar circumstances. She could not decline to become a witness, or exercise any option in regard to it. If called by him she must respond, or be punished for contempt. It is the husbandâ€™s right to call her, and as well the wifeâ€™s right to call him, by the same section. They may be witnesses, if the right thus conferred is exercised by either, but cannot be compelled to testify against each other, at the call of any other person hostile to either. This construction of the statute is demanded by its language. If it be not, then no benefit was created by the section and it is a nullity.
Sor was it error to allow the defendant, upon cross-examination, to he asked how many times he had been in prison.
Section 832 of the Code expressly authorizes such a line of examination. It declares that a person who has been convicted of a crime may be asked, on cross-examination, as to the facts. Hot only that, but it provides that the person cross-examining is not concluded, by his answer to such a question; so that if the witness falsely states that he was not convicted, his testimony may be disproved.
ThÃ© points presented on behalf of the appellant have thus been considered, and the duty of the court requires, for the reasons stated, a declaration that he shall take nothing by his appeal, and that the judgment should be affirmed.
Ordered accordingly.

1164470,WEBSTER v. PEOPLE,1883-05,"Daniels, J.
The facts stated by the district attorney and not denied by the prisonerâ€™s counsel supplied a complete answer to the application for the postponement of the- trial. The delay has been such as to subject the application to the; suspicion that it was not made in good faith, and the proposal m'ade by the prosecuting officer to go to the residence- of the- absent witness and take his evidence was entirely reasonable in itself, for it afforded the defendant the means- of using his evidence upon the trial. And when his counsel refused, as he did,, to- accept that offer, the court was justified in. denying the application, for the postponement. But even if that were not the- case, the exception taken to the decision would be of no avail upon a writ of error, for it is not a subject which can be brought up. for review in that manner. Eighmy v. People, 79 N. Y. 546.
The deed which' was made the instrument for obtaining, the money from the prosecuting witness, was set out in. the indictment, but it was not in terms- alleged to- have been sealed,, and as the deed offered in evidence upon the trial was sealed, this was objected to as rendering the deed produced, improper by the way of evidence. But in the attesting clause of the deed set out in the indictment, it was stated to have been sealed, and beyond that, alleging it to> have been a deed, was, in substance, alleging it to have been executed under seal. Paige v. People, 6 Park. 683. .
By a comparison of the deed produced with that set out in the indictment, the courses of two of the boundary lines appeared to have been omitted in copying the deed into the indictment. With the exception of those omissions, the copy obtained in the indictment was an exact copy of the deed as it was produced upon the trialbut on account of these omissions the deed itself was objected to as evidence, for the reason that in this respect it differed from that set forth in the indictment. But these differences were not important, for the copy in the indictment still constructively showed that the northerly and southerly lines of the land described,, were, fifty feet in length,, and as the easterly and westerly points were literally given, the description was not materially deficient, particularly as the lands were stated to have been staked out, and their length and breadth were afterwards given with the same precision as that shown by the deed itself. There was no possibility of the prisoner being misled by these omissions, for without them the copy was in legal effect and substantially the same as the deed executed by him.
The evidence .tended to show that the land which the prosecuting witness had agreed to purchase from the prisoner, was on the north side of the Long Island .Railroad, while that described in the -deed, both as it was set out in the indictment, Â¡and was made to appear upon the trial, is stated to be seventy-five feet south of the center of the Long Island Railroad. And -one -of the representations by which the money was obtained, is alleged to have been that the defendant falsely read the deed to the witness, as a deed of land on the north side of .the railroad, and in that manner obtained from him the money mentioned in .the indictment. This witness was an illiterate person, not able to -read the deed himself, and he and the other persons who were present at the defendantâ€™s office in the city of Hew York, when the transaction was completed, testified that the -defendant there read the description in the deed, as describing property on the north side, while in fact it wholly described property on the south side of the railroad, and the' prosecuting witness testified that he would not have paid the money if he had not believed the deed to contain the property which had been exhibited to him by the defendant, as the property to be sold, and which was situated on the north side of the railroad.
This was sufficient to make out the case, although other false representations were set out in the indictment, for where more than one of such representations are alleged, the case may still be established by proof of one of them. Bielschofsky v. People, 3 Hun, 40.
It is not necessary, therefore, to inquire whether the title of the defendantâ€™s wife to the property on the north side of the railroad, was shown to have been good and free from incumbrance, for the intentional misreading of the deed, in the manner in which that is stated to have been done, and by means of that reading obtaining the money of the prosecuting witness, were sufficient to lead to a denial of the motion made by the defendantâ€™s counsel, requesting the direction of a verdict of acquittal. As the case was presented, it justified the verdict returned by the jury, and the judgment should, therefore, be affirmed.
Davis, P. J., and Beady, J., concur.
Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals, the judgment was affirmed, and the following opinion was written :
Miller, J.
â€”Upon the application to postpone the trial of the indictment against the prisoner there were circumstances to excite suspicion in the mind of the court that the application was not made in good faith. There had been a long delay, as appears from the facts stated by the public prosecutor, which were not contradicted, and the proposition of the court to take the testimony of the absent witness at his residence was a fair one and would have given the prisoner the benefit of the testimony and should have been acceded to by the prisonerâ€™s counsel.
Although the presence of a witness is always desirable instead of his testimony being taken in writing, yet under the circumstances presented we do not think any just ground, on complaint exists for refusing to postpone the trial on the ground of the absence or the inability to procure the personal attendance of the witness. It is enough to justify the condition imposed that the judge had reason to suspect the application was not made in good faith. It may be added that upon a writ of error no exception lies to a refusal to postpone a criminal trial by reason of the absence of witnesses. Eighmy v. People, 79 N. Y. 546.
There was no error in admitting in evidence the deed offered by the prosecution. The objection is that the boundary lines northerly and southerly contained in the deed, were left out of the indictment, and that there was no seal. The indictment, it is true, does not in terms allege that the deed was sealed. It is so stated, however, in the attesting clause of the deed as set forth in the indictment, and the allegation that it was a deed was a substantial averment that it was under seal. Such a conveyance imports a seal, and it may be assumed therefore that the deed set out in the indictment contained all that was required to constitute a valid conveyance. The omission of two of the boundary lines from the description in the deed set forth in the indictment did not constitute a material variation and was not important, inasmuch as the copy in the indictment shows inferentially that the northerly and southerly lines Were fifty feet in length ; and as the easterly and westerly points were correctly given, the description was not radically deficient. The indictment stated that the lands had been staked out, and the length and breadth were given as stated in the deed itself. No mistake could have been made by the prisoner by reason of the omission as the copy was in substance and effect the same as the one he had executed. It is claimed by the appellantâ€™s counsel that the court erred in refusing to take the case from the jury. This position is based upon the ground that the evidence established that the mortgage was assigned to the prisoner and his wife on the 23d day of October 1872; that it was conceded, the prisonerâ€™s wife owned the fee of the land that was purchased at the time the representations were made; that the mortgage and fee in the land having merged the property was free and clear.
Assuming the correctness of this position, we think there was sufficient evidence to authorize the court to submit the case to the jury. It was alleged in the indictment as one of the false representations made by the prisoner to one John Breen, who was an illiterate person and unable to read writing that he owned four lots of land north of the Long Island Bailroad and that a deed purporting to be executed by him and wife to the said Breen was a deed and conveyance of the said four lots, and that the four lots were set forth and described therein, and that Breen, believing-the representations and that the instrument was a conveyance of said four lots, and being deceived thereby,, paid to-tile prisoner the sum of money mentioned in the indictment. The evidence shows that the witness was not able to read the deed, and that the prisoner read it to him falsely, in that the property was situated one hundred and seventy-five feet north of the center of the Long Island Railroad, and the prosecutor testified that he would not have paid the money if he had not believed the deed to contain a description of the property which had been exhibited to him by the prisoner as the property to be sold and which was situated on the north side of the railroad. There was proof to show the representations in regard to the location of the property were false, and that the allegation set forth in the indictment concerning the same was true. Where one or more pretenses are proved to be false, and the pretenses thus proved to be false are sufficient jper se to constitute the offense, the accused will be convicted notwithstanding that the public -prosecutor fails in proving to be false other pretenses alleged in the indictment. Butler v. Maynard, 11 Wend. 552; Bielschofsky v. People, 3 Hun, 40. Whether the land was free and clear from all incumbrances, was, therefore, of no consequence, if the intentional misreading of the deed induced the prosecutor to part with his money, and a case was made out independent of the false representations alleged to have been made in this respect.
It follows that there was no error in refusing to take the case from the jury, or in refusing to direct the acquittal of the prisoner.
The judgment should be affirmed.
Judgment affirmed.

1164446,PEOPLE v. PETREA,1882-11,"Learned, P. J.
The prisoner was indicted September 19, 1881. When arraigned he filed a plea setting forth certain alleged defects in the forming of the grand jury which indicted him. The district attorney filed a replication and the prisoner a rejoinder. The prisoner offered to prove certain facts set up in his plea. The court excluded the evidence, and, on the motion of the district attorney, overruled the rest of the plea. Thereupon the defendant demanded a trial and pleaded not guilty.
No such plea as that offered by the defendant is now allowed. Code. Crim. Proc. Â§Â§ 273, 332. And a Â¡alea must be oral. Â§ 333. It was proper, therefore, to require the prisoner to plead one of the three pleas authorized by section 332.
The prisoner, upon pleading not guilty, moved to set aside the indictment on the ground that the grand jury was unlawfully selected and drawn, and for the reasons stated in his. plea, and offered to prove certain facts by legislative journals and by oral testimony. The offer was overruled.
lie also moved to quash the indictment on the said grounds. This was overruled.
The Code of Criminal Procedure seems to have substituted a motion to set aside an indictment for the former motion to quash. Â§ 313. It must be set aside, when it is not found, indorsed and presented as prescribed in sections 268 and 272. The only ground which the prisoner makes is that none of the persons who, as grand jurors, found the indictment, were grand jurors.
A motion to quash an indictment, and so a motion to set it aside, should be made upon affidavits. No affidavit appears in this case. We know no practice by which the prisoner on such a motion offers to prove certain facts and endeavors to take exceptions to the exclusion of such offer. The proceeding is not a trial, but a mere motion, which must be based on affidavits. There are none here.
Again, so far as we can discover, the Code of Criminal Procedure has not provided for any review of the order granted on such a motion. Section 517 says that, on appeal, any intermediate order, forming a part of the judgment- roll as prescribed in section 485, may be reviewed. On turning to section 485 it will be found that the judgment roll is not required to contain the proceedings on a motion to set aside the indictment. So that we find no authority for the review of an order setting aside or refusing to set aside an indictment. If it be suggested that the proceedings on that motion should appear in the bill of exceptions, and hence in the judgment roll, the contrary is Â» shown in section 455.
Furthermore, we find no order whatever, refusing to set aside the indictment.
The legislature may well have thought that, as an indictment is only an accusation, it was sufficient to give the trial court power to set it aside, and was unnecessary to permit appeals from the action of that court.
It is, however, urged by the prisoner that the constitution provides that a person shall not be held to answer for such a crime, except on indictment of a grand jury (art. 1, Â§ 6); that the body which indicted him was not a legal grand jury; and that, therefore, he cannot be constitutionally deprived of this right to assert that he was not so indicted. That may be so ; the prisoner did assert that he was not legally indicted by his motion to set aside the indictment; and that -was decided against him. We do not understand that there is any constitutional provision which allows a party always. to appeal to the highest court, even when his grievance is that a constitutional right has been infringed. When and on what grounds, appeals shall be allowed, are questions for the legislature. So that unless a right of appeal has been given from an order, refusing to set aside an indictment we cannot hear that question. This paper was not a challenge to the array of grand juries, for none is allowed. Code Crim. Proc. Â§ 285. And after indictment found there could plainly be no challenge to the grand jury individually. Â§ 239. So far as the indictment is concerned, the prisonerâ€™s remedies are those given in section 313. But if we could review the refusal to set aside the indictment, we should find no error. Proceedings are not affected by imperfection in matters of form. Code Crim. Proc. Â§ 285. A grand jury is defined in section 223 ; the prisonerâ€™s allegation is that the persons who found the indictment were drawn by the officers, under claim of law, from the petit jury box instead of the grand jury box. But if this be a ground of objection it must be under section 238, subdivision 1, Code of Criminal Procedure. And that section leaves it to the discretion of the court to discharge the panel. The court.in which the indictment was found had jurisdiction. Persons wer.e returned to that court as grand â–?jurors, and were sworn and acted as such, and thus they formed a legal grand jury. Dolan v. People, 13 Sup. Ct. N. Y. 494. The prisoner having pleaded not guilty, a jury was ordered to be impanelled. Thereupon it appears the prisonerâ€™s counsel objected to the panel of jurors, and to each juror, upon the ground that chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881, was unconstitutional, being a local act, etc., â€?and offered to substantiate the same by proof, which was objected to, sustained, and an exception taken.â€?An objection to a panel of jurors and to each juror must have been intended as a challenge, that being the only mode known â€?to the law of making such objection. Code Crim. Proc. Â§ 359.
Now the first difficulty in regard to this challenge to the panel is, that such a challenge must be in writing. Â§ 363. No written challenge appears. The so-called plea referred only to the grand jurors. The next difficulty is that no facts are stated sufficient to constitute a challenge. It is not alleged that the petit jurors were drawn under chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881. Again, none of the proceedings required by sections 365 and 366 were taken. So that there was no exception to the challenge (Â§ 364); a denial of the challenge (Â§ 366); a trial of the challenge (Â§ 377). We do not know whether the court held the challenge to be sufficient, or the allegations to be untrue.' Nor does it even appear what evidence was offered, so that we can judge whether it was properly executed or not.
If we overlook all these difficulties and suppose that the court held the challenge insufficient, was there any error ? A challenge to the panel can be founded only on a material departure, to the prejudice of the defendant, from the forms presented by the Code of Civil Procedure in respect to the drawing and return of the jury (Â§ 362). The other ground contained in that section is not claimed. The forms prescribed for the drawing and return of the jury are found in the Code Civil Procedure (Â§ 1043-1048). An examination of those sections will show that there is nothing in them on which this challenge could be based.
It is not alleged that the clerk did not conduct the drawing of jurors in the very manner prescribed by these sections. His duty is to draw the jury from the .box containing the ballots (Â§ 1027). These ballots he is previously to prepare (Â§ 1038). The right to challenge the panel, .says nothing in express words as to a challenge for any material departure in respect to the preparing of the ballots. And che legislature may have thought that against the introduction of improper persons by the clerk, in preparing the ballots, the prisoner was sufficiently protected by his right .to challenge individual jurors for cause. Code Crim. Proc. Â§Â§ 375-377.
For if we overlook all the difficulties which we have seen stand in the prisonerâ€™s way on this appeal, and inquire what would have been his ground of complaint if he had properly presented it, we shall find it to be this ; that the county clerk in preparing ballots and putting them in the box under section 1038, Code of Civil Procedure, put in names which had not been selected- by the proper officers. It is not claimed that a list had not been made out and filed with the clerk or that he did not make his ballots from such list. But it is claimed that such list was not made out by the officers authorized to make the same; but was made by other officers claiming the legal light. Nor is it pretended that there was any list from which the clerk could prepare ballots.except that list from which lie did prepare them. How then can it be claimed that in drawing this jury the clerk departed from the forms of section 1017, .Code of Civil Procedure. The legislature may well have refused to give any right of challenge for any fault or error in the preparation of the jury list; provided only that the clerk properly drew the trial jury from the box of ballots prepared by him.
Assume, then, for the present, that the list of names of all persons believed to be qualified to serve as trial jurors was made up by the .wrong officers, what is that to the prisoner? If any juror drawn on the trial is objectionable he can be challenged. This list is made up, and the system of drawing jurors by the clerk is adopted â€?to secure a due and unifonn distribution of jury duty, and to guard the great body of jurymen from the fraud or favoritism of the drawing and summoning officers.â€?Friery v. People, 2 Abb. Ct. App. Dec. 230. Challenges to array existed formerly for the reason that there might be prejudice on the part of the sheriff. Now since such prejudice cannot affect the drawing, these challenges have been limited as above stated. Code Crim. Pro. Â§ 362. And there must be a departure â€œto the prejudice of the defendant.â€?No prejudice to the prisoner is shown or suggested. These irregularities are of no consequence. Cox v. People, 80 N. Y. 500.
But further, if the question of the constitutionality of chapter 532, Laws of 1881, were before us, we could not hold it to be unconstitutional. The restriction on the legislature contained in section 18, article 3 of the constitution, is qualified by section 25 of the same act. The restriction does not apply to any bill or the .amendments to any bill which shall be reported to the legislature by commissioners who have been appointed pursuant to law to revise the statutes. If this law is to be held unconstitutional, then it must be upon a finding of the fact that it was not so reported. Whether or not there were any such commissioners in 1881, is not decisive. They may have reported the bill several years before, although it was not passed by the legislature until 1881. We do not say that such is the fact; only that it is possible. Then the constitutionality of the law must depend, not on the construction of language,â€”which is a matter of law, and therefore, of conclusive judicial decision,â€”but on a question of fact, which may be found by one tribunal in one way and by another tribunal in another. On the trial of this present case, the court might, on the question of fact, have found that the commissioners did report the bill, and have held the law, therefore, constitutional. At the next court the same question may arise, and the court may find that the commissioners did not report the bill, and therefore, hold the law unconstitutional.
When the constitution permitted the legislature to pass such a law, if reported to them by certain commissioners, it necessarily made the legislature the judges of the fact, whether the law had been so reported. Their decision must be conclusive. No other rule would be tolerable. The constitutionality of laws can not be permitted to depend on the possibly varying decisions of courts or juries on mere questions of fact, especially on a fact as to which the legislature had special knowledge. Matter of N. Y. Elev. R. R., 70 N. Y. 351; People v. Devlin, 33 N. Y. 279.
The judgment and conviction should be affirmed.
Bockes, J.
The defendant was indicted in the Albany county sessions, September, 1881, for the crime of grand larceny, committed in August of that year. He was tried at the March term of that court, 1882, was found guilty, and was sentenced to imprisonment in the penitentiary for the period of five years.
When arraigned, he interposed objections to the finding of the indictment, in various forms; all, however, centering in this: that the grand jury which found the indictment, wrÃ¡s drawn from the names of persons selected by the recorder of the city of Albany, instead of from a list of names of persons selected by the supervisors of the county, and from the petit jury list; which proceeding in that regard, was taken under and pursuant to section 1011-of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by chapter 532 of the Session Laws of 1881, whereas, as was insisted, such section* as amended, was- unconstitutional, in so far as it provided for the selection of grand jurors in and for the county of Albany, by the recorder of that city; hence, that the grand jury should have been selected and drawn under and pursuant to the provisions of the Revised Statutes, which, as was claimed, remained in force..
The objection so urged against the indictment, was overruled by the court, and the defendant was put to his plea of not guilty.
The objection interposed was in the nature of a challenge to the array. It went to the entire panel, and was based on alleged vice or irregularity in the selection of the grand jurors by whom the indictment was found. It can make no- difference as regards the examination of the question before the court, that the objection was made by formal plea., like a plea in abatement to the jurisdiction of the court, or for misnomer. This was but a mode of presenting the question for decision. The point to be determined by the court was whether, on the alleged facts, the indictment was regularly foundâ€”whether the defendant was bound by law to make answer to it, on the merits, as to his-guilt or innocence. The mode of presenting the question is quite immaterial. Whatever may be the form of its presentation, the question is whether the objection, based on the alleged facts, was properly overruled. It is proposed, however, to examine the case in all its aspects, at least, in so far as it is needful to dispose of it as here presented.
The defendantâ€™s counsel insists that the question presented .â€™or decision, must be considered under the provisions of the Revised Statutes; this on the hypothesis that the act of 1881 (chap. 532) is unconstitutional and void, and that, as a consequence, the provisions of the Revised Statutes bearing on the subject, remain in force.
Row, let this be conceded, and let it be also admitted, that the objection to the indictment is, in effect, a challenge to the array, and should be so considered, and the objection is met and answered by section 28 of the Revised Statutes (2 R. S. 724, marginal paging), which declares that no challenge to the array of grand jurors shall be allowed in any other cases than such as are specified in the last preceding section (27), which section (27) does not include the ground here relied on. As was said by Selden, J., in Dawson v. People (25 N. Y. 404, 405), this statute â€?limits the grounds of challenge by persons charged with crime, to the prosecutor or complainant making the charge and the witnesses to sustain it.â€?This provision was, doubtless, intended to cover matters of irregularity in obtaining the panel of grand jurors, recognizing the fact that the substantial rights Â©f the accused could be and would be fully protected to him on the trial upon the indictment before the petit jury. If, therefore, it be assumed that the case is one of challenge to the array and that the question raised is to be controlled by the provisions of the Revised Statutes, it follows that the objection urged is nullified by the sections above cited. Carpenter v. People, 64 N. Y. 483.
Besides, it has been repeatedly decided that irregularities in the selection or drawing of grand jurors, not affecting the substantial rights of the accused, as regards the question of his guilt or innocence, are not good ground of challenge to. the array. Friery v. People, 2 Keyes, 424 ; Cox v. People, 80 N. Y. 500, 511; Dolan v. People, 64 Id. 485; S. C. in Supreme Ct., 6 Hun, 232, p. 170, 493. In Dolanâ€™s case the question was considered (as stated by Judge Daniels), on what was relied upon as a plea in abatement (See also statement of the case, 64 N. Y. 486, 487). In this case Judge Eakl says: â€?Courts do not look with indulgence upon objections to irregularities in the mode of selecting or drawing grand jurors, committed without fraud or design, which have not resulted in placing upon any panel, disqualified jurors.â€?But the defendantâ€™s counsel insists that the authorities relate to mere irregularities, and do not reach the case in hand, inasmuch as the ground of objection here is vital, such as (if admitted) deprives the array of the character of a legal panel. How, in Dolanâ€™s case, the ground urged was the same as is here urged, to wit: that the pretended grand jury which found the indictment, was not a grand jury in and for the city and county (64 N. Y. 486, 487); that it was not â€? lawfully created and organizedâ€?(6 Hun, 495), yet the objection was held inadmissible. The objection in that case was as â€?vital,â€?and as much deprived â€?the array of the character of a legal panel,â€?as in the present. I shall have occasion hereafter to refer more particularly to the ground of objection in Dolanâ€™s case. But attention is here called to the remarks of Judge Eakl in that case. The learned judge says : â€?The plea contains no allegation of any corruption, dishonesty or unfairness on the part of any of the officers, in selecting and drawing the grand jurors, or of any design to injure the defendant or any other person, and it contains no allegation that any of the persons who were upon the grand jury which indicted the defendant, did not possess the qualifications of grand jurors, or that any person was upon the jury, who would not have been there if all the forms of law, which are claimed to have been disregarded, had been complied with. It is not apparent how the alleged irregularities harmed the defendant, and it is certain that they had no relation whatever, to the question of his guilt or innocence of the crime charged. Under such circumstances, the indictment should be upheld unless the facts pleaded point out some vital error.â€?As above suggested, the objection there under consideration was no less vital than it is in this. The remarks of Mr. Justice Daniels, in Dolanâ€™s case, when in this â– court, are in line with those of Judge Eakl, above quoted. 6 Hun, 494; see, also, People v. Dolan, 6 Hun, 232, and Friery v. People, 1 Keyes, 424. From these and other cases it would seem, therefore, that these alleged errors urged by the defendant as a ground of objection to the indictment are untenable, inasmuch as it is not made apparent that he was or could be in any way injured or prejudiced by them.
But there is another answer to the objections urged, which seems entirely conclusive against their allowance.
The court in which the indictment was found had un: doubted jurisdiction of the case. The list of names of persons to serve as grand jurors was made up from the right sourceâ€?that is, from the body of the countyâ€”and the names of the persons drawn to serve as grand jurors were, as must be presumed, certified to the court in due form by the record. It is not pretended but that they were drawn by the proper officers ; nor but that they were, one and all, duly qualified to serve and act as grand jurors in and for the county of Albany; nor but that they were honest, intelligent and impartial, were duly summoned and impanelled in due form, and in all respects performed the duties of grand jurors according to the forms of law. Considered as officers of the law to aid in the administration of justice in criminal cases, they constituted a de facto body in the exercise of legal functions, under cover of lawful authority. So it was held in People v. Dolan (6 Hun, 232.), that it was sufficient to maintain the authority of the grand jury to investigate criminal charges and find indictments valid in their nature, that the body acted under color of lawful authority; and according to the case of Thompson v. People (6 Hun, 135), it would not alter this conclusion even if the selection of the grand - jurors involved in the proceedings the acts of an officer holding his office under an unconstitutional law. It was then decided that such officer must be deemed an officer defacto, whose acts could not be brought in question in a collateral proceeding between other parties. True, this latter decision was made with reference to the panel of petit jurors, but the principle thus declared is equally applicable to a case where like objection is urged to the panel of a grand jury. But the decision in Thompsonâ€™s case meets and answers the precise point urged here, to wit: that the recorder of the city of Albany assumed to act and did act in the selection of the jury list without authority, under and pursuant to an unconstitutional law. It was then directed that a challenge to the array by the accused could not be sustained, even were it true that the panel was selected by the commissioner of jurors appointed under an unconstitutional law; that such officer must be deemed to be an officer defacto whose acts could not be brought in question in a collateral action br proceeding. It is a well settled rule that the title of an officer de facto cannot be assailed collaterally; that the acts of such officer are valid in so far as the public and third persons are concerned. Thompson v. People, 6 Hun, 138, and cases there cited; Dolan v. People, 64 N. Y. 495; Carpenter v. People, 24 Id. 86; Dolan v. Mayor, 68 Id. 278, 279; see also 5 Waifâ€™s Actions and Defenses, and the many cases there cited.
As above stated, it matters not that one of the officers, through whose instrumentality the jurors were obtained, held his position under an unconstitutional law. In Thompson v. People, a challenge to the array was interposedâ€”the alleged ground thereof being that the panel of jurors was selected by Dunlap acting as commissioner of jurors under appointment by the mayor of the city of Hew York, in pursuance of an alleged unconstitutional law. The district attorney demurred to the challenge and it was disallowed. It was then said, â€œit is enough, in all cases, when such' a question is raised collaterally, that the person acting as an officer is discharging the duties of the office under color of right, evidenced by his possession of the office, and by exercising its functions under the power of an appointment or election independently of the question of legal title; hence the court below was entirely right in holding that Dunlap's official acts could not in this case be questioned by challenge or the ground alleged.â€?â–?To the same effect are the remarks of Daniels, Jâ€?in Dolanâ€™s gase (6 Hunn, 499) where the objection urged was of the same character as in Thompsonâ€™s case (64 N. Y. 483), and where the objection was raised by what was designated as a plea in abatement. A like objection was raised in Carpenterâ€™s case (64 N. Y. 483), to wit: that the act of the legislature under which Dunlap was appointed commissioner of jurors was unconstitutional. The court held that he was an officer de facto, whose acts were valid as to the public ; that this validity of his appointment cannot be drawn in question in this collateral manner. In State v. Carroll (38 Conn. 449), it was decided that one acting under color of an appointment by or pursuant to a public unconstitutional law before it was adjudged to be such, was to be deemed an officer de facto and that his acts as such were valid as to the public and third persons. This subject received a very elaborate examination in this case on the authorities, as well those of older date, as of a more recent period. _ In Commonwealth v. McCombs (50 Penn. 436), it was held that a person who holds an office under the apparent authority of a statute is an officer de facto, whose title could not be assailed collaterally even though the statute be unconstitutional. But it is said that the office of recorder was well filled by an officer holding under authority good both in fact and law; that it is not disputed that he was recorder and might well perform the duties pertaining to' that office. But the point is urged that other rights and powers were attempted to be conferred on him by an unconstitutional law. The case, however, is not changed by this view of it; and for the reason that the recorder was an officer de facto as regards the duties imposed on him by the law here challengedâ€”as much so as if a new office had been thereby created and he had been appointed to perform its duties. He was not an usurper' as regards the performance of those duties in any legal sense. A usurper is one who undertakes to perform official acts without any color of right; here the recorder acted certainly under a color of right. His action had the sanction of an apparent law duly certified to him, and to the people, as a valid law of the state. It may too be here added that it stands undisputed that the legislature under a certain condition or state of facts had the constitutional right to pass precisely this law. How every law which the legislature may pass is presumed, when duly certified as a law of tlie state, to.be valid. To meet this point a fact was averred which if proved would as was insisted render the law unconstitutional. But proof of such fact would be unadmissible. People v. Devlin, 33 N. Y. 269, and cases there cited ; Matter of N. Y. Elevated R. R. Co., 70 Id. 351. In this latter case Judge Eakl puts the inquiry â€?can the court take proof for the purpose of showing a statute valid and regularupon its face to be unconstitutional?â€?and gives a negative answer ; then in executing such law or executing any law indeed, duly certified as a valid law of the state, can it be maintained that the officer appointed to carry its provisions into effect acts in so doing without the semblance or color of authority ? The cases above cited, and many others referred to in those cases, answer this question in the negative. It is repeatedly and repeatedly declared in the decisions of the courts that an unconstitutional law gives the semblance or color of authority to its provisions. There was nothing decided in Lambert v. People (76 N. Y. 220) in conflict with the cases above cited. The precise point here under discussion was not in that case; and as it seems, the views of the several members of the court on the subject then considered were not in all respects in harmony. We conclude therefore that the objection here urged against the indictment was properly overruled; and this whether it be deemed to be a challenge to the array or considered as a plea in abatement; in either case the ground of objection must be held untenable.
So far the case has been considered without regard to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
But if the case is to he determined under the provisions of this Code, which went into effect on the 1st of September, 1881, before the indictment was found, (see section 962), and admitting the invalidity of the law of 1881, because of its alleged unconstitutionality, then by section 238, the objection being a challenge to the panel or array was inadmissible.
This section 238 declares that no challenge can be ""allowed to the panel or to the array of the grand jury ; but provides that the court may, in its discretion, discharge the panel and order another to be summoned in certain specified eases. This section, however, has application to proceedings to be taken before indictment found. The proceedings permissible to the accused after indictment are provided for in subsequent sections. Section 312 provides that the defendant may when-arraigned move the court to set aside the indictment, or may demur or plead thereto. Sections 312 and 313 declare in what cases only he may have the indictment set aside. The specified grounds of such motion do not touch the case in hand. We are then brought to section 321, which declares that the only pleading allowed to the accused is either a demurrer or a plea. Section 322 declares the cases in which a demurrer may be interposed, and confÃ­nes the demurrer to matters appearing on the face of the indictment. This section has here no application. Then section 332 provides for three kinds of pleas, to wit: Guilty, not guilty and former conviction or acquittal. No other pleas are allowed by the Code. The objection in this case, therefore, considered even as a formal, technical plea of matter in abatement was inadmissible under the Code of Criminal Procedure. Thus, if it be admitted that the case is to be determined under the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the objection urged was properly overruled.
In view of the conclusions above reached, it becomes necessary to examine the question by the defendantâ€™s counsel as to the validity of the act of ""June 16,1881 (chapter 532). We are of the opinion that the defendant was properly put to his plea to the merits.
He pleaded not guilty. On the trial upon such plea and in the outset, the same objections were interposed to the panel of the petit jury as had been previously urged against ""the panel of the grand jury, to wit: that the jurors had been selected from the body of the county, under and pursuant to the act of June 16, 1881, chapter 532, which act as was claimed was in violation of the constitution and void in so far as it provided for"" the selecting and drawing of jurors in and for the county of. Albany. This was in effect and in fact a challenge to the array of the petit jury. Was this objection or challenge properly overruled ? The same answer must be given as was made above to the objection to the panel of grand jurors, that is; the jurors were selected from the right sourceâ€”from the body of the county; they were duly drawn, summoned and returned to the court pursuant to the provisions of the law, by officers acting under the color of lawful authority; and they were in all respects duly qualified and competent to act as petit jurors in and for the county of Albany. According to the decisions above cited, the objection was properly disallowed, because the officers through whose action the jurors were selected, drawn and summoned were officers de facto if not"" de jure"", officers in puÂ»session of office, acting under color of lawful authority.
It should be added, perhaps, that section 562 of the Code of Criminal Procedure fully answers the objection interposed to the panel of trial jurors, if it be admitted that the case comes within its provisions.
It follows, therefore, that without considering the question as to the constitutionality of the act of 1881, the conviction and judgment appealed from, must be affirmed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164434,PEOPLE v. PETREA,1883-04,"Andrews, J.
defendant was indicted at the September term of the Albany county. sessions, 1881, for the crime of grand larceny, committed on August 2, 1881. He was arraigned at the March term, 1882, and on his arraignment filed a special plea, setting forth in substance, that the grand jury which found the indictment was not a legal grand jury, for the reason that it was not drawn from any list of grand jurors selected by the shpervisors of Albany county, but. from a list of petit jurors, pursuant to chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881, which act is alleged in the plea to be unconstitutional, in that it is a local act for selecting and drawing grand juries in the city and county of Albany, and was not reported to the legislature by commissioners appointed to revise the statutes, and was passed in contravention of article 3, section 18, of the constitution, adopted in 1874, which forbids the passing by the legislature of a private or local bill, in certain .enumerated cases, and among others, for â€?selecting, drawing, summoning or impaneling grand or petit jurors.â€?The defendant accompanied his plea with an offer to prove the facts stated in the plea, and especially to prove by the clerk of the senate, by the commissioners appointed to revise the statutes, by the journal of the legislature of 1881, and by the original act itself, that the act was not reported to the legislature by any commissioner or commissioners appointed to revise the statutes.
The court overruled the plea and offer of proof, and the defendantâ€™s counsel thereupon moved the court to set aside the indictment upon the grounds set forth in the special plea, and offered to. prove the facts as before, which motion was denied, and this was followed by a motion to quash the indictment upon the same grounds, and upon the offer of the same proof, which motion was also denied. The defendant thereupon interposed the plea of not guilty, and a jury was ordered to be impaneled to try the issue. The defendantâ€™s counsel thereupon objected to the panel of petit jurors, on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the act of 1881, under which the list of petit jurors was selected, and offered to substantiate the facts hereinbefore stated, by proof. The court overruled the objection, and a jury was impaneled, and the trial proceeded, and resulted in the conviction of the defendant, of the crime charged in the indictment.
It will contribute to a clear understanding of the question raised in respect to the constitutionality of the act of 1881, to have in view the laws in force at the time of the passage of that act, regulating the selection of grand and petit jurors in the county of Albany. Prior to the act of 1881, grand jurors in the county of Albany were selected under the general provisions of the revised statutes. The list was prepared by the supervisors of the county (2 R. S. 720, Â§ 1, et seq.) and was returned by them to the county clerk, who placed the names in a box, from which, from time to time, prior to the terms of the courts, the names of twenty-four persons were drawn, to serve as grand jurors. The petit jury list was also made up in accordance with the system prescribed by the general statutes for the selection of petit jurors in the counties of the state, with a single exception, viz.: the selection of persons in the city of Albany, to serve as petit jurors, instead of being made by the supervisor, assessors and town clerk, as provided in case of towns, was made by the supervisor and assessor of the respective wards, each ward being for that purpose considered as a town. This method of selecting petit jurors in the city of Albany, was first prescribed by the revised statutes (2 R. S. 413, Â§ 23) and the provisions of the revised statutes upon that subject as to the city of Albany, were incorporated into the Code of Civil Procedure, passed in 1876, in the article relating to the mode of selecting, etc., trial jurors, as section 1041.
The next legislation on the subject of grand and petit jurors in Albany county, was chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881, which is the act now in question. That act purported to amend section 1041 of the Code of Civil Procedure, by inserting therein the following provisions: â€?In the city of Albany, the recorder of said city shall perform the duties imposed by this title upon the supervisor, town clerk and assessors of towns. In Albany county, grand jurors shall hereafter be drawn from the box containing the names of petit jurors selected for said county, in the same manner as petit jurors, and hereafter no separate list of grand jurors shall be prepared for said county.â€?This act, if valid, effected an entire change in the system of selecting grand jurors in Albany county. It abrogated the provisions of the revised statutes, imposing upon the supervisors of the county, the duty of preparing a list of grand jurors, and made the petit jury' list, fro hao vice, the grand jury list also. Thereafter there was to be neither a separate grand jury list, nor a separate box containing the names of persons selected as grand jurors. The change in respect to the selection of petit jurors, made by the act of 1881, was much less radical, and consisted simply in the substitution of the recorder of the city of Albany, in place of the supervisors and assessors of the wards, to discharge the duty of preparing the jury lists in that city. The act of 1881, so far as it relates to the selection and drawing of grand jurors for the city and county of Albany, is a local act upon that subject, and is within the prohibition of article 3, section 18, of the constitution, unless excepted therefrom by force of section 25 of the same article. That section is as follows : â€?Section 25. Sections seventeen and eighteen of this article shall not apply to any bill, or the amendments of any bill, which shall be reported to the legislature by commissioners appointed pursuant to law to revise the statutes.â€?It is a part of the legislative history of the state, that prior to the adoption of the constitutional amendments of 1874, commissioners to revise the statutes, had been appointed by the legislature, who had from time to time made reports of their proceedings to that body, and when the constitutional amendments were adopted, they had not completed their labors, but were still engaged in the work of the revision.
The plain object of section 25, article 3, which was one of the amendments adopted in 1874, was to exempt from the operation of section 18, private or local bills which had been, or should be reported by the commissioners. But with the exception of bills originating with the commissioners, and reported by them to the legislature, the prohibition of section 18 is absolute. The language of the section needs no interpretation. Construed in connection with section 25, it forbids the enactment of any private or local law by the legislature in cases enumerated therein, and not falling within the exception in section 25. The legislative power vested in the senate and assembly, is subject to the limitations of the constitution, and it needs no citation of authorities to show that the legislature, like every other department of the government, is subject to the supreme will of the people, as expressed in the organic law.
If the proof offered by the defendant in support of his plea, was admissible, and the facts offered to be proved, were established, there can be no doubt that the part of the act of 1881, relating to the selection and drawing of grand jurors in Albany county, is unconstitutional. The intention of the act was to take Albany county out of the operation of the general statutes of the state, relating to the selection and drawing of grand jurors, and to substitute for that county a special system, applicable to that county alone. But it is insisted by the counsel for the people that the unconstitutionality of the act cannot be established by proof aliunde that the act was not reported to the legislature by commissioners. We have no doubt that the presumption in favor of the constitutionality of statutes, applies in this case, and that in the absence of proof to the contrary, it will be presumed in support Ã³f the constitutionality of the act of 1881, that it originated in a bill reported by commissioners. But the question whether a statute is constitutional, is in its nature a judicial one. The question most frequently arises upon the face of the statute itself, and the question of constitutionality is determined by comparing the statute with the constitution. But it often depends upon extrinsic facts, not appearing upon the statute book. In cases involving the constitutionality of what are known as two-third bills, it has been held that the court may go behind the statute book, and look at the original bill, to ascertain whether it was, passed by the constitutional majority. People v. Purdy, 2 Hill, 31; S. C., 4 Hill, 384..
The case here is of the same nature, but arises upon a different limitation of legislative power. The proof offered did not contradict any facts asserted on the face of the statute, nor so far as appears in any legislative record. On the contrary, the offer was to show by the journal of the legislature, and by the original act, the facts averred in the plea. The constitution would afford very slight protection against legislative usurpation, and the object sought to be accomplished by the amendment in question, could be easily frustrated, if the mere fact that the legislature had passed a local or private bill in one of the enumerated cases, created a conclusive presumption that the bill was originally reported by commissioners, and was within the exception of section 25. The tendency of judicial authority supports the- proposition that whenever a question arises as to the constitutionality of a statute, the court may resort to any source of information which in its nature is original evidence of any fact relevant to the inquiry. Purdy v. People, 4 Hill, 384; Gardiner v. Collector, 6 Wall. 499 ; Post v. Supervisors, 105 U. S. 667 ; Berry v. Baltimore, &c. R. Co., 41 Md. 446 ; Opinion of Justices, 52 N. H. 622.
This rule excludes all inquiry as to the motives of the legislature in passing the particular statute. Such an inquiry is wholly irrelevant, the only inquiry permitted being whether the enactment, the constitutionality of which is assailed, is forbidden by the constitution.
We think the offer to prove by the journal of the legislature and by the original act, that the act of 1881 was not reported by commissioners, was improperly overruled, and as the fact alleged must be deemed on this appeal to have been proved, the conclusion that the act so far as it relates to the selection and drawing of grand jurors, is unconstitutional, cannot be avoided.
The question of the constitutionality of the act of 1881, so far as it relates to the selection of petit jurors, depends upon different considerations. When the act of 1881 was passed, there was a local act then in existence, regulating the selection of petit jurors in Albany county. By the existing law, which was enacted first by the revised statutes, and re-enacted by the Code of Civil Procedure in 1876, the selection of petit jurors in the city of Albany, was committed to the supervisors and assessors of the respective wards of the city. The only change made by the act of 1881, as has been said, was to make the recorder the selecting officer, in place of the supervisors and assessors. There can be no doubt that the act of 1881, by which this change was wrought, was a local law. The point to be determined is whether it was a local law for the selection of petit jurors, within the sense and meaning of article 3, section 18, of the constitution. It seems quite plain that the amendment of an existing local law regulating the selection of petit jurors, which simply transferred the power to select the petit jurors within the city, from one local officer or set of officers to another local officer, is not within the mischief at which the constitutional amendment was aimed. By the existing local law the city of Albany was taken out of the general plan. The legislature by the act of 1881, left this law in force, changing it only in the respect mentioned. The qualifications of petit jurors, were substantially resurrected in the Code in 1876. 2 R. S. 411, Â§ 13; Code Civ. Pro. Â§ 1027. It was made the duty of the selecting. officers to select from the last assessment roll of the town (or city) and to make a list of the names of all persons whom they believed to possess the qualifications prescribed by the general statute. Code Civil Pro. Â§ 1036. This duty was in the main ministerial, and in the city of Albany, prior to the act of 1881, was devolved upon the supervisors and assessors of the ward, and by that act, on the recorder.
We think it would be too strict a construction of the constitutional provision, to hold that no existing local law upon one of the subjects mentioned in article 3, section 18, of the constitution, can be amended in any detail,â€?without violating the constitution. This question was considered to some extent by this court in the Rapid Transit cases. 70 N. Y. 327, 361. In the case first referred to, Eabl, J., referring to the section of the constitution now in question, said-, â€?these constitutional provisions do not prohibit a private or local bill to amend the charter of private corporations, by regulating powers, rights, privileges and franchises which it previously possessed,â€?and in the case last cited, OhÃ¼rch, J., referring to the same provisions, said, â€?They must be sustained and applied by a rational and practical construction, so as to subserve the purposes intended, and prevent the evils designed to be remedied, but not by an artificial and technical construction, to extend their application to- cases- never contemplated.â€?It is a plain proposition, recognized in the cases referred to, and in the subsequent case- (In re Brooklyn, &c. 75 N. Y. 335), that- the legislature- cannot, under the guise of an amendment of a private and local bill, make a new and original enactment in evasion of the constitutional prohibition.
The act of 1881 in reference- to- petit jurors, is not we think within this principle. It did not inaugurate a local system for the selection of petit jurors in the city of Albany, but, as we have said, continued an existing' one, changing it in one- of its-details. Special laws have been passed, and are now in force), regulating the selection of jurors- in the counties of New York and Kings. These laws extend to- great detail, and contain many special provisions. It would- be a dangerous construction of the constitutional provision which would prohibit any alteration in those and like statutes, and p-lace it beyond the power of the legislature to amend any of their provisions.
The question before us is not free from difficulty, but one eonelusion is that a reasonable and practical construction of the epnstitution upholds the act of 188-1 in- respect to the substitution of the recorder in place of- the supervisors and assessors, to discharge the duty of preparing the petit jury lists, and that this conclusion fairly rests on the ground that the act is not in a proper sense an act for the selection of petit jurors, but a regulation of an existing local law on the subject, within the purview of the constitutional prohibition.
The next question which arises is whether the arraignment and trial of the defendant upon the indictment in question, was a violation of the constitutional guaranty that no- person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime (except in certain cases mentioned, not material to- the present inquiry), â€?unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury.â€?Const, art. 1, Â§ 6. It is insisted on the part of the defendant that the body of men which found the indictment in question, was ne-t a grand jÂ¡u-ry, that the paper filed- as an indictment was not an indictment, and that the defendant could not be held to answer thereto, or be put upon his trial thereon. In considering this question, it will be convenient in the first' place, to recall the actual facts. The objection to the constitution of the grand jury which found the indictment, lies solely in the fact that they were drawn, under the provisions of a void statute, from the petit jury list, whereas they should have been drawn from a list of grand jurors, specially selected to serve as such by the supervisors of Albany county. In all other respects the proceedings -were regular. The jurors were drawn by the proper -officer, they were regularly summoned and returned by the sheriff, they were recognized, impaneled and sworn as grand jurors -by the -court; and as grand jurors they found the indictment; and m-oreover they were good and lawful men, duly -qualified to sit :as grand jurors. Hone of these facts are negatived by the plea, and they must be assumed in determining the question before us.
The principle that no person shall be put upon trial for an infamous crime unless on presentment -or indictment of a grand jury, has been regarded as one of the securities of civil liberty, and is embodied among the fundamental provisions of the federal and state constitutions. The institution of the grand jury has been said by high authority to be one of the barriers between the liberties of the people and the prerogatives of the crown. 4 Blk. 346. The interposition, of a body of competent citizens charged to inquire of offenses between the individual and the finding of .a formal accusation upon such inquiry, before he can be put upon his trial for an infamous crime, forms the substance -of the right guaranteed by the law of England, and by the constitution of the state. But the constitution -does mot define what shall constitute a grand jury. It refers to the grand jury as an existing institution, audits essential character must be found by reference to the common law, from which it has been derived. By the common law a grand jury must consist of not less than twelve, nor more than twenty-three, and twelve must concur in finding an indictment; and they must be good and lawful men of the county. Hawk. P. C. vol. 2, ch. 25, Â§ 16; Chitty's Crim. Law, vol. 1, 307. The constitution does not define the mode of selection, and it has never been supposed that the states in adopting the common law institution of the grand jury, adopted the mode of selection which prevailed in England. In England grand jurors were formerly selected by the sheriffs (2 Hawk. P. C. ch. 25, Â§ 16), but in this state the sheriff is the summoning and returning officer, and has no part in the selection or preparation of the jury lists; and it is doubtless competent for the legislature to enact such regulations and make such changes respecting the mode of selecting and procuring grand jurors, as it may deem expedient, not trenching, however, upon the essential feature of the system. People v. Stokes, 53 N. Y. 164.
We are of opinion that no constitutional right of the defendant was invaded by holding him to answer to the indictment. The grand jury, although not selected in pursuance of a valid law, were selected under color of law and semblance of legal authority. The defendant in fact enjoyed all the protection which he would have had if the jury had been selected and drawn pursuant to the general statutes. Nothing could well be more unsubstantial than the alleged right asserted by the defendant, under the circumstances of the case. He was entitled to have an indictment found by the grand jury, before being put upon his trial. ' An indictment was found by a body, drawn, summoned and sworn as a grand jury, before a competent court, and composed of good and lawful men, This we think fulfilled the-constitutional guaranty. The jury which found the indictment was a de facto jury, selected and organized under the forms of law. The defect in its constitution, owing to the invalidity of the law of 1881, affected no substantial right of the defendant. We confine our decision upon this point to the case presented by this record, and hold that an indictment found by a grand jury of good and lawful men selected and drawn under color of law; is a good indictment by a grand jury within the sense of the constitution, although the law under which the selection was made, is void. It will be time to consider the extreme cases suggested by counsel, when occasion shall arise.
The remaining question relates to the right of the defendant to avail himself by plea, or objection in other form, of the defect in the proceedings in selecting or drawing the grand jury which found the indictment. If the defect in the constitution of the tribunal, deprived it of the character of a grand jury in a constitutional sense, there can be no doubt that the court would have been bound to take notice of it, although no statute authorized it, or even if the statute assumed to preclude the raising of the objection. But when the defect is not of that character, and the defendant may be held to answer the indictment without invading any constitutional right, then the question is one of procedure merely, and the right of the defendant to avail himself of the objection, is subject to the regulation and control of the legislature. In times past courts have been inclined to go very far in sustaining technical objections in criminal cases, but there is much less reason for this, now than formerly, when comparatively trivial offenses were punished with the greatest severity. The indictment in question was found after the Code of Criminal Procedure was enacted and took effect, and the proceedings are governed by its provisions. We are of opinion that under the provisions of the Code, the court was justified in refusing to entertain the objections made. Section 238 prohibits any challenge to the panel or array of grand jurors, but the court is authorized in its discretion, for certain causes stated, to discharge the panel and order another one to be summoned ; section 239, provides for challenges to individual jurors. Both of these sections relate to proceedings to be taken before indictment, and are irrelevant to the present inquiry. Section 312 provides that in answer to an indictment the defendant may either move the court to set the same aside, or may demur or plead thereto. The causes for which the defendant may move to have the indictment set aside, are defined in section 313. Section 321 declares that the only pleading on the part of the defendant, is a demurrer or plea, and section 332 declares that pleas are of three kinds: (1) guilty; (2) not guilty; (3) a former judgment of conviction or acquittal.
The paper filed by the defendant was not a plea authorized by the section last mentioned,, and the motion to quash or set aside the indictment,, is not for any cause embraced in section 313. The Code by defining the causes- for which the indictment may be set aside, must by the general rule of construction, be held to exclude the entertaining of the motion for other causes than those specified. The intention of the Code was to discourage technical defenses to indictments, not affecting the merits, as is apparent from the sections cited, as well as the provisions relating to amendments, and the proceedings on the trial. Code Crim. Pro. Â§ Â§ 293, 362., This general purpose is more directly indicated by section 285, which declares, â€?that no indictment is insufficient, nor can the trial, judgment or other proceedings be affected by reason of an imperfection in matter of form, which does not tend to the prejudice of the substantial rights of the defendant upon the merits.
We think the objection to the grand jury was not one which, by the new procedure, the defendant could take after indictment, and, as it involved no constitutional right, that it was properly overruled.
These reasons lead to an affirmance of the judgment

1164485,PEOPLE v. BERNARDO,1883-05,"Smyth, Recorder.
The appellant was tried and convicted by the Court of Special Sessions of a violation of section 3 of chapter 374 of the Laws of 1862, and was sentenced by the court to be imprisoned in the penitentiary for the term of six months.
He now appeals from the judgment, so rendered against him, upon the following grounds :
1. That the crime of which he was convicted is a felony, and, therefore, the court has no jurisdiction.
2. That the section of the act' under which he was convicted, is repealed by the Penal Code.
3. That the evidence did not establish the commission of any crime.
The section of the statute under which the conviction was had, is as follows :
â€?Every person who shall lay hand upon the person of another, or upon the clothing upon the person of another, with intent to steal, under such circumstances as shall not amount to an attempt to rob or an attempt to commit a larceny, shall be deemed guilty of an assault with intent to steal, and shall be punished as now provided by law for the punishment of misdemeanors.â€?It further provides that it shall not be necessary to allege or prove in any prosecution for an offense under this section, any article intended to be stolen or the value thereof, or the name of the person so assaulted.
The evidence on the trial established the following facts, viz.: That on the evening of March 17. last, in Yesey street, near the market, the appellant thrust his hand into the pocket of a garment then on the person of a woman. That the v itness, who saw him do so, informed a police officer of what he had seen, and caused the arrest of the appellant. That there was no violence used by the appellant, nor was any threatened by him. Ho property was taken from the woman or from her person, nor was there any proof that the pocket into which the appellant thrust his hand, contained any property of any value.
The woman was not examined on the trial. The appellant and other witnesses were examined by the court, but with the exception of the denial of the appellant, and liis contradiction by the other witnesses, the evidence was not very material.
The facts thus disclosed by the evidence do not constitute either an attempt to rob or commit larceny, and was not sufficient to sustain a conviction of a common assault and battery.
The word assault, as it is used in the act of 1862, is so used in a sense and as descriptive of something essentially different from the common law definition of that word. At common law, an assault is defined to be an attempt or offer with force or violence, to do a corporal hurt to another; an intentional attempt by violence to do an injury to another; any unlawful physical force, partly or fully put in motion, creating a reasonable apprehension of immediate physical injury to a human being.
Had the words â€?one who assaults another with intent to steal â€?been used instead of the words contained in the actâ€?â€?one who lays hands upon the person of another with intent to steal â€â€”the purpose of the act would probably have been defeated.
The act was framed to meet a defect existing at the time of its passage in the criminal law, which defect frequently rendered it impossible to convict of any crime persons who were constantly engaged in making attempts to steal from the person or the clothing upon the person, by picking pockets.
Laying the hands upon the person or clothing of another, unaccompanied by any violence and when it could not be shown that there was property on the person or in the clothing on the person on whom the attempt was made the subject of larceny, would not amount to an attempt to commit larceny.
If the facts and circumstances established by this evidence satisfied the trial court, beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellantâ€™s guilt of the offense charged against him, the conviction was sustained by the evidence and he was properly convicted and sentenced, provided the section of the act under which he was tried and convicted was not repealed by the Penal Code.
The appellant insists that it is repealed by section 726 of the Penal Code, which provides that â€?all acts and parts of acts which are inconsistent with the provisions of this act (the Code) are repealed so far as they impose any punishment for crime except as herein provided.â€?â€?A careful examination of the provisions of the Penal Code has led me to the conclusion that the â€œactâ€?of the appelLnt, which is made a crime and punishable.as a crime by the act of 1862, is neither criminal or punishable under any of the provisions of the Penal Code.
The material question to he determined is whether the Code has repealed the act in question or whether it is a â€?statute of
â–?this state not repealed by said Code.â€?Section 2, Penal Code. The act in question amended an act passed in 1860 (L. 1860, c. 508, Â§ 34), which act created a crime which, prior to the passage of said act, was unknown to the common law, designating the crime so created as an â€?assault with intent to steal,â€?and punished it as a misdemeanor.
Ifor could a conviction for an assault and battery be had, because in almost every case there was an entire absence of violence on the part of the would-be thief, and no evidence upon â– which an intent to commit that crime could be predicated.
For the purpose of meeting these difficulties and punishing persons engaged in endeavoring to deprive others of their property by means of pocket-picking, the acts of 1860 and 1862 were passed and a new crime created and declared to be a misdemeanor, and as such punishable.
If or is the offense designated in this act an assault or an attempt to commit an assault, within any of the degrees of that crime provided for in the Penal Code, nor is it within any of the degrees of larceny or attempts to commit that offense as â–?defined in the Code.
The intent to steal, which is made a crime by said acts, negatives any co-existing intent.to do or threaten to do violence or bodily injury to the person intended to be-deprived of his propertyâ€”the intent is to steal and that only.
To accomplish that object it requires caution, gentleness and secrecy, and an entire absence of any violence on the part of the thief against the person of his victim.
The Penal Code neither provides for, defines nor punishes the crime of which the appellant was convicted, nor does it contain any provision inconsistent with the provisions of the act of 1862, nor dees it repeal that act, but on the contrary it expressly declares by section 725 that nothing therein contained affects any of the provisions of certain specified acts and statutes, and recognizes and continues in full force â€?all acts defining and providing for the punishment of offenses not defined and made punishable by it.â€?Penal Code, Â§ 725 ; see also Â§ 2.
I am clearly of the opinion that the act under which the appellant was convicted and sentenced is in full force, not having been repealed or affected by the Penal Code, and that the Court of Special Sessions had jurisdiction of the offense with which the appellant was charged.
The judgment appealed from must therefore be affirmed.
I desire to express my thanks to Mr. J ustice Kilbreth for the able brief submitted by him in this case on the part of the people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164424,SAWYER v. PEOPLE,1883-03,"Ruger, Ch. J.
The record brings to this court the evidence and certain exceptions taken to the rulings of the court below as to the admissibility of some of such evidence.
The only questions open to discussion here are whether any evidence was given in support of the conclusion reached by the jury, and whether the court below erred in its rulings upon the questions propounded to witnesses by the plaintiff in error.
It was a fact, established on the trial by the uncontradicted evidence of all of the witnesses in the case, that on the evening of April 15, 1880, upon or near the corner of Forty-second street and Seventh avenue, in the city of New York, the defendant fired a pistol at one Theophilus Steele, the bullet from which struck said Steele near or upon his nose and then penetrated the head inflicting a dangerous wound.
It was also a conceded fact that previous to this time complainant and defendant had been upon unfriendly terms. The question litigated upon the trial was whether at the time of the shooting the defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that the complainant intended to make an assault upon him and that such assault placed his life in jeopardy. We have carefully examined the evidence, taken on the trial and found it difficult to harmonize the statements of the witnesses, but for that reason a question was presented peculiarly adapted to the judgment and consideration of the jury. The burden would seem to rest upon the defendant to establish to the satisfaction of the jury the existence of sufficient cause to justify him in the use of a deadly weapon, such as he concededly used on this occasion.
Upon the evidence in this case we think the jury were justified in saying that the existence of such cause was not established to their satisfaction, although if they had found the other way there would have been no ground upon which to disturb their verdict.
Wo have also carefully examined the several exceptions taken by the plaintiff in error to the rulings of the court appearing in the record. While the counsel for defendant in his printed points, questions three of such rulings, but two of them are shown by the record to have been taken by him. These relate to the exclusion by the court of answers to the following questions put to defendantsâ€?witnesses by his counsel. â€?In your association with him it has been your observation that he is a peaceable character, his disposition as to peaceableness.â€?Q. â€?What is your judgment as to his disposition as to peacefulness or quarrelsomeness â€?
Each of the witnesses to whom these questions were put was allowed to answer all questions relating to the general character of the defendant, although they showed but slight acquaintance with it, and were allowed to, and gave favorable answers to questions referring to his character for quietness and peacefulness. While we think from these circumstances no possible injury could happen to the defendant by the exclusion of the evidence objected to, we also think the questions were objectionable as being leading and calling for the opinions of the witnesses as to the chai'acter of the accused based, upon their personal observation. It was competent for the defendant to call witnesses as to his general reputation and character, but this is as far as the rule permits him to go.
We think the questions were objectionable in form as well as substance, and were properly excluded.
The judgment should be affirmed.

1164464,PEOPLE v. NOELKE and MARKS,1883-03,"Brady, J.â€”The
defendants were charged in the indictment with having sold, on' March 7, 1882, to one Joseph Mattocks a half ticket in the Louisiana State Lottery.
They were arrested on March 27, by Mr. Anthony Com-stock, who was a witness at the trial, and who at the same time searched their premises, under the authority of a search warrant, which he exlxibited to them. He found and seized a quantity of lottery material, including a blank-book containing the entries of tickets sold by them.
It also appears that, upon that occasion, Noelke was asked to produce such lottery tickets as he had, and replied : â€?There are none;â€?and, pointing to Mattocks, said: â€?I woxxld have sold some of them to him, if I had lxad them; he bought before.â€?It also appears that on his way to the station-house, Mr. Com-stock asked him why he did not go out of the lottery business, and he said that he had about made up his mind go to out of the lottery and policy business and simply cany on his brokerage business.
It further appealed that after. Noelkeâ€™s arrest, he had an interview with Mattocks, in which he offered to give him a sum of money to leave the State, go to New Jersey and not appear against him, and that the witness intimated that he would take $1,200, which amount Noelke promised to bring the next day. Marks seems to have had some connection with this incident, as the bearer of a letter from Noelke.
On the tiâ€™ial the defendantâ€™s memorandum book, containing entries of sales of lotteiy tickets was produced and put in evidence, in which was foxxnd an entiy of the numbers of the same-class of lottery tickets referred to in the indictment. A great many objections and exceptions wex-e taken by the defendantâ€™s counsel upon the trial. In the main they weiâ€™e general, no; specific giâ€™ound being stated. Under the general rule which is applicable to such exceptions they may be regarded as valueless, raising no question in consequence of their general character. Tooley v. Bacon, 70 N. Y. 34; Levin v. Russell, 42 Id. 251; Daly v. Byrne, 77 Id. 182; Schile v. Brokhahus, 80 Id. 615.
The counsel for the respondents has taken occasion to cite from the report of a Western case the views of the court on that subject, which commend themselves to this court, namely :
â€?The practice of taking general and obscure exceptions at the moment, in order to cover the case, and enable counsel on subsequent critical examination to raise points under the exceptions which have never been suggested at all to the mind of the trial judge, is objectionable on many grounds, and is contrary to theory upon which points are allowed to be raised by excep-* tions.â€?Turner v. People, 33 Mich. 362, 382; Adams v. State, 25 Ohio St. 584, 587.
An examination of this case, however, has led to the conclusion that none of the exceptions taken are of any validity, assuming them to have been presented in proper form to require this court to consider them. The first of those exceptions, in the order of their importance, at least, would be those which relate to the form of the indictment. It is declared to be insufficient, for the reason that it simply alleges that the defendant sold a lottery ticket, without describing the purpose or object of the lottery, or alleging that it was intended for the purpose of chance or obtaining money, goods, or valuable things, and, further, for the reason that it does not charge any offense in violation of the statute. The answer to this springs from the substance of the indictment itself, and is complete without reference to any of the adjudicated cases. It is alleged therein, that the defendants unlawfully sold to one Joseph Mattocks, a part of a ticket in a certain lottery not expressly authorized by law, commonly called the Louisiana State Lottery, and further, that a more particular description of the lottery is to the . grand jury unknown, and cannot be given. The word â€?lottery â€?has, it was said, no technical legal meaning. It must be construed in a popular sense, with a view of remedying the mischief intended to be prevented. It is defined by Webster, â€?A scheme for the distribution of prizes by chance, or the distribution itself,â€?and he defines â€?lot â€?as that which â€?causes, falls, or happensâ€”that which in human speech is called chance, fortune, hazard,â€?and â€?to draw lots â€?is to determine an event by drawing one thing from a number whose marks are con- ' cealed from the drawer, and thus determining an event. Worcester defines â€?lottery â€?as â€?a hazard in which sums are ventured for a chance of obtaining greater value.â€?Per 0 hueoh, Oh. J-., in Wilkinson v. Gill, 74 N. Y. 63. And in that case, â–?the language of Folger, J. (to be found in Hull v. Buggies, 56 W. Y. 424) it was also said, might be adopted as a result of the accepted definitions, namely, â€?Where a pecuniary consideration is paid, and it is determined by lot or chance, according to â€¢some scheme held out to the public, what and how much he who pays the money is to have for it, that is a lottery.â€?With great deference to the suggestions of Chief Justice 'Church, it is, nevertheless, thought that the word â€?lottery â€?has a technical legal meaning. It means precisely what, used in a popular sense, it describes, when employed in a statute effecting the subject it embraces. The legislature must be assumed to have used the word â€?lottery â€?in its popular sense. It was the mischief of that species of gambling that was to be prevented. The people were to be protected from the allurements of the 'doctrine of chances, by punishing the persons engaged in selling lottery tickets, and hence the statute. It 'would seem, therefore, to be a sufficient description on the â€¢offense, to charge the sale of a lottery ticket, commonly called â€¢tjae â€œLouisiana State Lottery.â€?This is a statement in substance and effect that a chance in a scheme for the distribution â€¢of prizes was sold by .the defendants, and which scheme was a violation of the law of the State.
This is the '.effect of the word â€œlotteryâ€?as used in the -statute, â– and an the indictment as well. It is impossible that the â– defendants, when thus charged, could be misled. They could mot -fail to understand the offense set out, to be the sale of a lottery ticket for the Louisiana State Lottery, and that such lottery was to result in a distribution of prizes to successful ticket-holders.
â€œThis would be a reasonably certain way of describing the crime committed.
But the indictment went further than this. It set out the ticket, which is as follows :
It will be perceived, upon a reading of this ticket, that it refers to â€?the monthly two-dollar drawingâ€?and declares that it entitles the holder to one half of such prize as may be drawn, ii presented for payment before the expiration of three months from the date of the drawing.
The word payment conclusively shows that it was intended for the purpose of chance, and obtaining money, goods or valuable things. No other conclusion can be drawn from it by the impartial mind.
â€?This proposition is dear, unquestionable and undebatable. It has been held in a series -of cases that such an element appearing in the indictment, it is sufficient under the laws of this State.
Thus for example, in People v. Warner (4 Barb. 314), a case which has not been -questioned, it was held that an indictment for vending a lottery ticket need not expressly aver that the ticket was of a lottery established or set on foot for the purpose of disposing of real estate, goods, money or things in action, and that the character and description of the lottery need not form the -subject -of an express averment. It is sufficient if these appear argumentatively in the indictment, especially after verdict. rtf
It was contended in that case, as in this, that the indictment should expressly aver the vending of the ticket of a lottery established and set on foot for the purpose of disposing of real estate, goods, money or things in action. And this contention rested upon the authority of People v. Payne (3 Den. 88).
In that case (People v. Warner) the indictment charged the prisoner with â€?selling a ticket in the Grand Consolidated Lottery of Delaware and Georgia, numbered 731, which ticket purported to entitle the holder thereof to one-quarter of such prize as might be drawn to its number, subject to a deduction of fifteen per cent., payable forty days after the drawing,â€?&c.
The court said : â€?The defendant has been proven to have sold a ticket of this description, namely a ticket entitling the holder to a quarter of a certain prize, deducting fifteen per cent. It seems to us impossible to maintain that the lottery in this case was not established to dispose of prizes of real estate, money or things in action, and it is difficult to entertain a doubt that the prize was to be paid in money. The fortunate holder could not otherwise very conveniently receive his quarter deducting fifteen per cent.â€?It may be said in this case that it would be impossible to entertain a doubt that the prize was to be paid in money, for the reason that it must be presented for payment. It was further said in that case : â€œIt is, however, argued that the character and- description of the lottery does not form the subject of an express averment.â€?The court said, â€?it is sufficient that it appears argumentatively (especially after verdict), sincÃ© the enactment of the statute (2 R. S. 728, Â§ 32) which declares that no indictment shall be deemed invalid, nor shall the trial, judgment or proceedings thereon be affected by reason of any defect or imperfection in matters of form which shall not tend to the prejudice of the defendant.â€?And- in? the case of Pickett y. People (8 Hun, 83), an indictment which charged the defendant with having willfully, unlawfully and knowingly sold what are commonly known and called lottery policies to persons unknown to the jurors, and did then and there vend divers of said lottery policy tickets to persons to the jurors unknown, was held sufficient. Only reasonable certainty is required. The. learned justice writing the opinion cited the case of People v. Taylor (3 Den. 91), in which the same doctrine is substantially maintained. So far as the case of People v. Payne (supra) is in conflict with the views herein expressed, it has been overruled. But an examination of it shows that the indictment contained nothing from which it appears, argumentatively or inferentially, that there was to be a distribution of any property, real or personal.
In the statement of the ease it is said there were four counts for selling a ticket, a quarter of a ticket, a paper purporting to be a quarter of a ticket, and for bartering a paper purporting to be a quarter of a ticket of a lottery authorized by the laws of the State. None of the counts stated for what purpose the lottery was opened or made, and nothing was set out from which it could be inferred. The case, therefore, is very different from the case in hand, in which it clearly appears from the ticket itself that there is to be a prize, and that it is to be paid, if won, on presentation of the ticket.
The defendantâ€™s counsel, in connection with the objection to the indictment just considered, presented the following :
â€?That the indictment charges the defendants with having sold a part of a lottery ticket in a lottery not expressly authorized by law, which was the language of the statute in force prior to the adoption of the constitution in 1827, such statute expressly prohibiting, in the State of New York, the selling of lottery tickets and lottery policies in any lottery not authorized by law: as the time was limited for the closing of the lotteries, however, by statute, after the adoption of the constitution in 1827, lotteries in the State of New York could not be expressly authorized by law.â€?It is freely confessed that the proposition designed to attract the attention of the court is not understood. It is not revealed upon the points. The second constitution of the state was adopted in 1821 and amended by amendments which were proposed by the legislatures of 1825, 1832, and 1834, none of which had any reference to lotteries.
The provision in the constitution of 1821, by section 11 of article 7, declared that no lottery should be thereafter authorized in the 'State and that the legislature should pass laws to prevent the sale of all lottery tickets except in lotteries already provided by law. The act of April 13, 1819, which was in existence at the time of the adoption of the constitution of 1821, authorized certain lotteries in this State under licenses, and repealed the several acts, of the legislature relative to lotteries, with a proviso that the repeal should not be deemed to release or exonerate the managers of lotteries or any other person or persons from any liabilities they might have incurred in or under said acts (see Laws 1819, ch. 206, p. 258). It was to these lotteries that the provision of the constitution related. The Ee vised Statutes passed in 1829 and 1828 (1st ed. p. 664), embraced the provisions of the act of 1819, the twenty-sixth section of article fourth, â€?Of Baffling and Lotteries,â€?providing that every lottery, game or device of chance in the nature of a lottery, by whatever name it might be called, other than such, as had been authorized by law, should, be deemed unlawful and a common and public nuisance. Hie second edition of the Eevised Statutes, which included all laws of a general nature passed from 1828 to 1835 inclusive, and certain, local acts of 1836, omitted the sections contained in the statutes in reference to licenses for lotteries for which provision had been made under the title â€?Of Eaffling and Lotteries,â€?sufra (2d edition R. S. p. 668), and this was done under the provisions of article 7, section 11 of the constitution of 1821, sufra, and chapter 306 of the Laws of 1833 (laws of that year, p. 484), which set out that whereas John B. Yates and Archibald McIntyre, assignees of all the unsatisfied lottery grants made by the State, had executed to the people thereof an agreement that all lottery grants theretofore made should cease and determine, and released the people from all right, title and claim to continue or draw any lottery from the close of the year 1833, provided the legislature should pass an act declaring that the lotteries authorized by the State be continued until the close of the year, the people enacted that the lotteries authorized by law to be drawn in this State might be continued until the close of the year, and provided that at the expiration of that period it should not be lawful to continue or draw any lottery within the State, but all and every lottery theretofore granted, or authorized within the State, should absolutely cease and determine.
The constitution of 1846, also, by article one, section ten, declared as follows: â€?Nor shall any lottery hereafter be authorized, or any sale of lottery tickets within this State,â€?and the result is that the provision of the act of 1827 (see Laws 1827, p. 829), against persons dealing in chances â€?authorized by special law for that purpose â€?is now an impossible qualification, all lotteries having been abolished, and there being no persons authorized by special laws to engage in them, by sale of tickets or otherwise (see 4th ed. R S. p. 77). And the further result is that the prohibitory and punitory provisions of the statute are left intact. The learned counsel for the defendants may have intended the proposition as a criticism upon the redundancy of the charge in the indictment, that the sale of the tickets was in a lottery â€?not expressly authorized by law,â€?which, until the statute of 1833, supra, was doubtless a necessary averment; but it is no longer, no lottery being allowed, and none being, therefore, expressly authorized by law. The unnecessary allegation does not affect the validity of the indictment, however, in any respect, because it is true, and therefore correct. The lottery referred to was not authorized by the law of this State. It would seem, from the absence of any elaboration of this point on the part of the defendantâ€™s counsel, that he did not rely upon it, but it was deemed prudent to examine and develope it in the consideration of the case and to show that the averment belongs to by-gone days.
It follows that there is nothing of substance in the proposition. It was also objected on the trial that the witness Mattocks, having purchased the ticket, was an accomplice, and that under the provisions of the Code, section 399, no conviction is justified upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.
The court upon this subject instructed the jury that they could not convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplice, and unless he was corroborated by such other evidence as tended to connect the defendants with the crime charged in the indictment. And further, that the corroboration was not sufficient if it merely showed the commission of a crime and the circumstances of it; so that the defendants had the full benefit of this rule in the instructions which the court gave. The difficulty with this proposition, lies however at the root of it, namely, that Mattocks was not an accomplice. The ticket which he purchased was not bought with a criminal intent. It was purchased for the purpose of proving the fact of its sale by the defendants. The design of his application for . a.ticket was to show that the defendants were engaged in an unlawful business. There can be no doubt that a purchase made under such circumstances does not make the purchaser an accomplice. There must exist a criminal intent. This is settled, both in England and this country. Reg. v. Mullins, 3 Cox, 526; People v. Farrell, 30 Cal. 316 ; St. Charles v. Oâ€™Malley, 18 Ill. 407; Campbell v. Commonwealth, 84 Pa. St. 197 ; Commonwealth v. Downing, 4 Gray, 29 ; State v. McKeon, 36 Iowa, 343; Wright v. State, 7 Texas Ct. App. 574.
Some of those cases are precisely in point; indeed, it has become a necessity for the suppression of crime to resort to this mode of ascertaining whether a prohibited and criminal act may be committedâ€”the victims of a business which it distinguishes failing in the moral courage to complain or to appear as witnesses. Without its use many crimes would increase in number and magnitude, the law be openly violated, and the authorities helpless from the absence of such proof as may be required for a conviction. The utmost that can be said of the person employed is that he is an informer, and leave to the jury the consideration of his evidence as such.
Aside from this, however, it appears that Mattocks was corroborated at every point, as to bioelke at least, by his admission at the time of arrest that he had sold to Mattocks.
It is also urged on behalf of the defendants to be doubtful whether, in the light of recent decisions of the Court of Appeals, the vending of a Lousiana Lottery ticket is an offense. This seems to be a very extraordinary proposition. The Eevised Statutes declare, as said in the case of Hull v. Ruggles, per Folger J., 56 N. Y. 426, that every lottery, game or device of chance in the nature of a lottery, by whatsoever name it may be called, other than such as have been authorized by law, shall be deemed unlawful; and in the case of Grover v. Morris, 73 N. Y. 476, Judge Andbews said expressly : â€?Lotteries authorized by laws of other States are unlawful here, and are illegal within the meaning of the thirty-second section â€?(referring to the statute). This is conclusively settled by the decisions construing other and cognate sections, and in the case of Ormes v. Dauchy, 82 N. Y. 443, and upon which the counsel for the appellants relies in this element in the case, although it was held that, â€?a contract made in this State to advertise a lottery in other States, in the absence of proof that such advertisement is in violation of the laws of those other States will not be held illegal,â€?it was expressly declared by the learned judge writing the opinion of the court, that if the contract was for an advertisement of a lottery scheme in violation of our statute, then the judge erred upon the trial in denying the motion to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that the contract was void as against public policy. It may be said further, that that was an action brought to recover of the defendant commissions upon a contract for advertising, which was procured by the plaintiff and his partner for the defendants who were advertising agents. The advertisement related to a lottery which was to have taken place in Virginia and it Was said that the exact nature of the contract was uncertain, there being no evidence given of a publication in any newspaper in the State of Hew York, and it was said that there was a question of fact for the consideration of a jury as to whether the contract embraced any newspapers published in the State of Hew York. This being the case, there was no error committed by the judge in denying the motion to dismiss the complaint, unless the contract to advertise in other States was illegal and void, and such the court thought was not the rule in this State; and it was further said, that the publication therefore, outside of the State was not within the prohibition of the statute of this State; and as there was no proof that the law of any other State was violated, and as the law would not presume an agreement void as illegal or against public policy when it was capable of a construction which would make it consistent with the laws and valid, it-would not be considered as illegal. These authorities, therefore, furnish no ground whatever for the proposition that a lottery lawful in another State may be made the subject of enterprise in this State under our laws. All lottery schemes under our statute, whether they originate in this State or any other, are under the authorities as shown illegal, and subject those who are connected with them by the sale of tickets to arrest, conviction and punishment. See Kohn v. Koeller, 21 Hun, 466.
It is also urged, on behalf of the appellants, that the court erred in permitting certain questions to be asked and answered by the defendant, JSToelke, who was examined on his own behalf. The appeal book does not contain the whole of the evidence given upon the trial; it is presented in a fragmentary form. These questions were all of them, however, germane to the offense, and to the defendantsâ€?Â«business in connection with the lottery schemes, lottery tickets and lottery policies; for example, he was asked,' â€?Have you not"" been engaged since prior to 1877at that place,â€?namely, 238 Grand street, â€œin the business of lottery tickets and lottery policies ?â€?The defendant declined to answer the question, lest it might tend to criminate him. The objection to this series of questions is predicated chiefly of the case of People v. Crapo, 76 N. Y. 291, in which the court said, that when the accused was offered as a witness on his own behalf, the prosecution, to entitle them to put to him, upon cross-examination, questions which are irrelevant to the issue, and calculated to prejudice him with the jury, must, at least, be such as to clearly impeach his general moral character, and his credibility as a witness, and that it was not legitimate to bolster up a weak case by probabilities based on other transactions. These questions were clearly designed to impeach his general moral character and his credibility as a witness, because they related to transactions of an illegal character, in which, from the nature of the question, he was supposed to have' been engaged. They were perfectly legitimate, therefore, although they were not all answered, as already appears from* the refusal of the witness to answer, upon the ground that the answer might tend to incriminate him.
It is also urged that there was not sufficient evidence to convict Marks. This proposition cannot be sustained; he was aiding and assisting in the sale; this appears from the testimony of Mattocks, who said that when he purchased the ticket, Marks was present, and that Moelke said to him â€œMarks, hand me a ticket,â€?that Marks handed bfoelke a half ticket out of the safe, and Hoelke then handed it to him ; and the defendant, Hoelke, on his examination, stated that the defendant, Marks, and a Mr. Henry were the only clerks that he had had in his office for three years, and that Henry had been employed recently to care for the office during his and Marksâ€?absence. This evidence was sufficient to submit the question of the guilt of Marks to the jury, and their finding upon this subject is conclusive. There can be no doubt that Marks knew perfectly well what the ticket was, for he had been for a long time in the employment of Hoelke, and was engaged with him in the sale of lottery tickets in violation of the law. It appears also in the case, that the first witness called for the people was Anthony Comstock, who testified â€?that he was secretary and chief special agent of the Hew York Society for the Suppression of Vice that he was â€œa peace officer of this county,â€?and â€œspecial deputy sheriffthat as such, on March 29, 1882, he went to defendantâ€™s place of business at 238 Grand street, in the city of Hew York, in accordance with a search warrant issued on certain affidavits, which search warrant was offered in evidence, and which search warrant had embodied therein, a warrant for the arrest of said defendants in the indictment.
The admission of the search warrant and the matter pertaining thereto was objected to on the part of the defendants upon the trial upon the ground: â€?That such document appears
to refer to a different proceeding, relating to a different complaint, and having no reference to the subject matter of this indictment.â€?The court admitted it because the witness said that he went there with the warrant and called the defendantsâ€?attention to the cause of arrest.
It will be perceived that the objection to the admission of the warrant rested upon the proposition that it related to a different complaint and no reference to the subject matter of the indictment. The counsel now arrays against it the assertion that it was issued without the authority of any statute and was an infringement upon the constitutional rights of the defendant and repugnant to the expressed provision of section 2 of the Bill of Bights.
These views were not presented to the court below, and no objection of this kind was suggested. The counsel also assails it upon the ground that the statute of this State prior to the adoption of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided a variety of instances in which the issuance of search warrants should upon proper affidavits be admitted, and lie gives the instances and claims that none of the statutes existing were any authority for issuing such an instrument as that set forth in the case, but section 791 of the Code of Criminal Procedure defines, as he concedes a search warrant to be:
â€?An order in writing in the name of the people, signed by a magistrate, directed to a peace officer, commanding him to search for personal property and bring it before the magistrate and section 792 provides â€?upon what grounds it may be issued,â€?namely: /
1. â€?When the property is stolen or embezzled.â€?2. â€?When it is used as the means of committing a felony.â€?3. â€?When it is in the possession of any person with the intent to use it as the means of committing a public offense, or in the possession of another to whom he may have delivered it for the purpose of concealing it or preventing its being discovered.â€?The warrant in this case was predicated on proof by affidavit that certain property, to wit, what was commonly known as, or are called lottery tickets and certain writing, cards, books, advertisements, circulars, notices offering prizes and stating price of tickets, and when and where the same may be had, documents, personal property, tables, devices and apparatus for the purpose of enabling others to sell or vend lottery policies or lottery tickets, and at, within and upon said premises Charles D. J. Noelke and Jacob Marks did sell, vend, furnish and procure and have in their possession these articles in violation of the laws of the State of New York with the intent to use the same as the means of committing a public offense and to promote, maintain and carry on a common public nuisance, and avers that the justice had reason to suspect and believe that the articles and things aforesaid were then sold upon the premises of the said Noelke and Marks situate at 238 Grand street. It is quite clear from the statement of the contents of the warrant that it' justified the examination of the premises for the purposes stated, the allegation being that there was in the possession of the persons named, with intent to use it as a means of committing a public offense, certain property, viz., tickets, cards, books, documents, tables, devices, etc. Considering the objections which are now urged for the first time on appeal against the introduction of this paper, it is quite clear that they are of no value, and further, that the original objection that it did not pertain to the offense charged against the defendant has no value, for the reason that an examination of the premises was germane to the subject of the indictment, viz., the vending of a lottery ticket, which was the charge against the defendants, and which might be established in part by evidence found upon the premises affecting the business of selling lottery tickets there.
The other exceptions have been examined, but no doubt is entertained of their invalidity and they should not be sustained. They are thus considered and disposed of without going into detail in reference to them. It only remains to say that the specific requests to charge, which were not embraced within the charge of the learned recorder, were properly rejected. In the charge the defendants were given the benefit of every principle of law to which they were entitled, and every advantage, as well in the submission of all the facts and circumstances which bear upon the question of their guilt or innocence ; the case was presented to the jury in all the aspects in which the defendant or either of them had the right to have it considered, fully, fairly and clearly ; and the jury were told in conclusion that they must be satisfied of the guilt of both or either of the prisoners beyond a reasonable doubt; in other words, the prosecution must bring home guilt to both or either of the prisoners beyond all reasonable doubt, and that if a doubt existed, it would be the duty of the jury to give them the benefit of such doubt and acquit. The jury were also told that they should examine all questions of conflicting evidence carefully and conscientiously and with an honest effort to ascertain the truth, and having ascertained it to declare the result independent of any other consideration; and the jury were also told that the fact that the defendant Marks did not avail himself of the right which the laws of the State gave him of becoming a wit-on his own behalf was not permitted to prejudice him in the slightest degree. They were told also that they were the sole judges of all questions of fact and of all questions of the credibility of witnesses, and were to exercise their rights in these respects entirely independently of any opinion the court might possibly have expressed in the case.
It does not appear consequently that any injustice has been done the defendants in any respect, and the judgment should not by reason of any exception taken during the trial be reversed. It must, therefore, be affirmed.

1164427,PEOPLE ex rel. FULLER v. CARNEY,1883-01,"Haight, J.
It is contended on the part of the district attorney that no appeal lies to this court from the adjudication of the Court of General Sessions, and that the appeal should be dismissed. This question was passed upon by this court in the case of the People ex rel. Board of Charities of the City of Utica v. Davis, reported in 15 Hun, 209. In that case it was held that an appeal will lie to this court.
Since the making of this decision the remaining nine chapters of the Code of Civil Procedure have been enacted Subdivision 9 of section 3347 provides: â€?chapter 12 does not affect the statutes remaining unrepealed after -the first day of September, 1877, touching the review of proceedings in a criminal case.â€?Sections 1340 and 3357 of the Code gf Civil Procedure are included in chapter 12.
In view of this subsequent legislation we have thus thought â–?it advisable to examine the question, and determine whether an appeal will lie in these proceedings.
The reviser in his notes to section 1340 of the Code, calls attention to the decision of People v. Davis, supra, and then to the subdivision 9 of section 3347, thus intimating that he did not consider the provisions of section 1340 applicable. The first question to be determined is whether or not these proceedings are civil or criminal.
Barbour, in his criminal treatise (522, 523) called them quasi criminal, and such they have ever been regarded by the courts until the enactment of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in which they are denominated â€?special proceedings of a criminal nature.â€?See part 6, title 5, of part 6, which makes provision for the support of a bastard child, the manner in which the father is to be determined, and for an appeal from the order of the magistrate to the Court of Sessions of the' county, and for the determination by that court. No appeal, however, is provided from the judgment or determination of the Court of Sessions. The former Code pertained to procedure in civil actions and proceedings, the latter Code to criminal actions and proceedings. Subdivision 9 of section 3347 of the former Code, expressly provides that the chapter in reference to appeals in civil action's and proceedings does not affect the review of proceedings in criminal actions; all of the statutory provisions in reference to these proceedings are embraced in the Criminal Code.
Our conclusions' are, therefore, that sections 1340 and 1357 of the Code of Civil Procedure, have no longer any application to these proceedings, and, therefore, do not authorize a review by appeal to -this court. Section 515 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that â€?writs of error and certiorm'i in criminal cases as they have heretofore existed are abolished, and hereafter the only mode of reviewing a judgment or order in a criminal action is by appeal.â€?Then follow the provisions for appeals to Supreme Court from the judgment of a conviction after indictment, etc. It will be observed that the writ of error and certiorari are abolished only as to criminal actions. No provision is made for abolishing the writs as to special proceedings of a criminal nature.
As to these proceedings they appear to stand as they have heretofore existed. Heretofore, it has been the practice to review these proceedings in that court upon the common law writ of certiorari, and such we regard as the correct practice under the present Code. The district attorney should have moved seasonably to have had the appeal dismissed, instead of bringing the case on for argument on the appeal. In view of the fact that the defendant was probably misled by the decision of People v. Davis, we are of the opinion that the defect' should not be deemed to have been waived. Upon the trial, the district attorney asked of the the mother of the bastard child, who was then a witness upon the stand, this question: â€?Look at the child and tell what the color of its eyes are ?â€?This question was objected to by the defendant, upon the ground that it was immaterial, incompetent and improper. The objection was overruled and exception taken by the defendant. The witness answered, â€?Its eyes are blue.â€?We are of the opinion that this was an error. This evidence enabled the court to compare the color of the childâ€™s eyes with those of the defendant, who was present in court. We do not regard this kind of evidence as safe or proper.
In the case of Petrie v. Howe, reported in 4 Thomp. & Cook, 85, the question was as to the color of the childâ€™s hair. It was held in that case that such evidence was calculated to and probably did prejudice the defendant, that it was improper, and a new trial was granted. The argument used in that case in reference to the color of the hair applies with equal force in this case as to the color of the eyes. Common observation reminds us that in families of children different colors of hair and eyes, are common, and that it would be dangerous doctrine to permit a childâ€™s paternity to be questioned or proved by the comparing of the color of its hair and eyes with that of the alleged parent. We discover no other error in this case.
Judgment reversed, and proceedings remitted to the Court of Sessions of Erie county and a new trial ordered in that court, with costs of this appeal to abide the event.

1164477,OSTRANDER v. PEOPLE,1883-04,"Hardin, J.
[After stating the facts as above.]â€”By chapter 25 of the Laws of 1870, the city of Borne was incorporated. 1 Laws 1870, 40.
The first section of the charter declares viz : â€?All that part of the county of Oneida, now known as, and being the town of Borne, shall be a city known as the city of Borne, .... etc. Section 1 of article II. contains provisions enumerating the offices of said city, and among them it is declared that â€?four justices of the peace â€?shall be elected by the city at large; and section 10 of the same article declares viz.: The term of office of the justices of the peace to be elected under this act, shall commence on the first day of January next ensuing their election, and each of such officers shall take the oath of office within ten days thereafter, and file the same with the clerk of Oneida county.â€?In section 13 of title 4, it is declared viz.: â€?The justices of the peace of the said city shall have and exercise all the powers, authority and jurisdiction, and discharge all the duties, and be entitled to the fees, and compensation of justices of the peace of the several towns in the state, except as modified by this act.â€?â€œAnd all laws applicable to justices of the peace of the several towns, and to their official acts, duties and powers shall apply to the justices of the peace of said city, and to their official acts, duties and powers.â€?In section one of title seven is a provision conferring upon the Recorder â€œsole and exclusive jurisdiction in said city to issue all criminal process required to be issued by the justices of the peace of the several towns of this state, to hear all complaints .and to conduct all examinations in criminal cases, hold courts of Special Sessions and to do and perform all the duties of such courts, and to conduct and try all matters of a criminal nature, which may by law be done or tried by a justice of the peace or by two justices of the peace.â€?Then follows in section 3 of the same title, a provision in case of sickness, absence from the city, disability or inability to act of the said recorder conferring and imposing â€?his powers and duties â€?upon either of the several justices of the peace of said city.
We are of the opinion the charter in its provisions as to justices of the peace is valid, and that it was competent for the legislature to confer upon them the powers enumerated in the charter, and to withhold from them in the cases presented the powers, which otherwise would devolve upon them. Section IS of article 6 of the constitution as it was amended in 1869 was in force.when the charter was passed; that section of the constitution declared, viz. :
â€?Justices of the peace and district court justices shall be elected in the different cities of the state in such manner and with such powers and for such terms respectively as shall be prescribed by law.â€?It was clear then that when Kenyon was elected a justice of the sessions he was a â€?justice of the peace,â€?and he was eligible to the office of justice of the sessions. See. 15 of art. 6, constitution. He was a justice of the peace in the county of Oneida and, therefore, within the terms of section 40 of chapter 280 of the Laws of 1847, eligible to the office of justice of sessions. However, if there was a doubt in our minds in respect to his eligibility to the office of justice of sessions, we should incline to the opinion that he was a justice of sessions defacto, and that his acts would be valid and binding upon third parties until questioned and declared invalid in a proceeding of quo warranto directly had for that purpose, and that the Oyer and Terminer of January, 1883, where the motion was made to -fix a new day for the execution of the sentence of the prisoner, had no power to set aside the conviction and judgment thereon, with the affirmance thereof by this court pronounced in October 1882.
In People v. White, 24 Wend. 526, Bnoxson, J., said: â€?But this is a case where officers having apparent authority to do the act have rendered judgment between the people and the prisoner, and neither party can, in this collateral way, call in question the title of the judges. If there had been judgment of acquittal it would have precluded the people, and the-prisoner could not have been further prosecuted.â€?Approved, 23 N. Y. 296. See Morris v. People, 3 Denio, 397; In re Wakker, 3 Barb. 162; Cronin v. Gundy, 16 Hun, 524. The affidavit used in the Oyer and Terminer when the order was made which we are considering stated that Maxfield, who was a justice of the peace of the town of Annsville at the time of his election, had not â€?two years to serve as such justice of the peace in and for the said town of Annsville.â€?That fact does not impeach or impair his right to act as a justice of sessions. In section 34 of chapter 470 of the Laws of 1849 it was provided, viz.:
â€?That no justice shall be so designated unless he shall be entitled to serve as a justice of the peace during such year by virtue of the election under which he shall be acting as such justice at the time of such designation.â€?This provision was an amendment of section 40 of chapter 280 of the Laws of 1847 which required a justice of the peace to be eligible, to have at least two years from the first day of January next after said election to serve. â€?The later statute controls, and Maxfield was de jure a justice of sessions.â€?Nelson v. People, 23 N. Y. 293.
There was no error in refusing to amend the record in respect to what took place in the Oyer and Terminer before the trial of the prisoner. The application came late. The record as made up had been presented to this court and acted upon, and our judgment, based upon that record, was conclusive upon the Oyer and Terminer, where the prisoner was taken in January, 1883, for the purpose of having a day named for its execution. Besides, there was no proof upon which the court could act which indicated that the judgment record was erroneous. The motion in regard to what transpired in regard to entering a special plea after a general plea of not guilty was properly denied.
These views lead us to conclude that no error was committed by the Oyer and Terminer held in January, 1883, in making the order directed by it and entered in Oneida county as of the term commencing January 29, 1883.
Fourth. It is now urged that the Oyer and Terminer sitting in January, 1883, held by a justice of this court, without any associate, erred in holding that it had power to sentence the prisoner without the two associate justices being present. On June 4, 1882, by chapter 360 of the laws of that year, section 23 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was amended so as to read, viz. : â€?A court of Oyer and Terminer is held by a justice of the Supreme Court without an associate,â€?.
After its passage there was no law which authorized justices of sessions to sit in the Oyer and Terminer. The prisonerâ€™s counsel calls our attention to section 962 of the Code of Criminal Procedure actions. That section declares that â€?criminal actionsâ€?and â€¢â€?proceedings in criminal casesâ€?theretofore commenced must be conducted in the same manner as if this had not been passed. This provision does pot relate to the organization of the court. Fuller effect may be given to the words of section 962 by limiting them to â€?the manner â€?ip which proceedings or actions shall. be â€?conducted â€™â– â€?after they are taken up by any court to which they shall be presented. Tlie organization of a court is one thing; its manner of conducting its proceedings or actions pending in it is quite another.
Giving full effect to section 23 as amended ip 1882 and to section 962 we hold that the Oyer and Terminer was rightly organized when a justice of this court sat alone, as section 23 prescribes he may without associates. Willett v. People, 27 Hun, 470,
The views we have expressed lead us to say no error was committed by the Oyer and Terminer of January, 1883.
Had the district attorney moved to dismiss the appeal taken from the order we should have been inclined to grant the motion. There is no provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure authorizing such an appeal as the one now before us. Section 517 authorizes an appeal to this court â€œfrom the judgment on a conviction after indictment, and upon the appeal any actual decision of the court in an intermediate order or proceeding forming a part of the judgment roll .... may be reviewed.â€?This does not authorize an appeal in piecemeal, first from a judgment, and after it is affirmed, an appeal from any subsequent order by a subsequent and independent appeal. See Piper v. Van Buren, 27 Hun, 384 ; Code Criminal Procedure, Â§ 485.
As such motion was not made, we have looked into the merits, and come to the conclusion that the order ought not to be reversed by us under the peculiar circumstances.
We conclude to affirm the order, instead of dismissing the appeal upon our motion.
Order affirmed and papers ordered filed with the clerk of Oneida county.

1164429,PEOPLE v. HOVEY,1883-06,"Ruger, Ch. J.
The defendant was convicted in the Court of General Sessions in the county of New York of murder in the first degree for killing one Fannie Vermilyea on April 2G, 1882.
It is not denied that the deceased met her death at the hands of the defendant, but it was attempted to be shown on liis behalf that the killing was accidental and unpremeditated.
No exceptions were taken upon the trial by the defendant either to the rulings of the court in the admission or exclusion of evidence or to the various propositions contained in the charge to the jury.
It is claimed by the appellant that by virtue of section 527 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this court has the power to review the case upen the facts, and if upon such review it finds that the verdict was either against the weight of evidence, or against law, or that justice requires a new trial, such trial should be directed, although no exceptions were taken in the court below. We are of the opinion that this section does not apply to appeals to this court. It is contained in chapter 1 of title 11 of the Code, which embraces seventeen sections; some of which treat exclusively of appeals to the Supreme Court, and others of appeals to this court, while still others apply indiscriminately to appeals to both. Section 527 is entitled â€œStay of proceedings on appeal to Supreme Court from judgment of conviction ; new trial when granted,â€?and contains not only the provisions in question, but also others made applicable to the Supreme Court alone.
Section 528, immediately following, is entitled â€?Stay upon appeal to the Court of Appeals from judgment of Supreme Court affirming judgment of conviction.â€?It refers exclusively to appeals to this court, and contains no provision for a review by us of the case upon the evidence.
Section 527 is nowhere made expressly applicable to this court, and the provision for a review upon the facts being confined to that section and omitted from the section expressly treating of appeals to this court, forbids the inference that it was intended to Â¡De applicable to the Court of Appeals. Matter of Ross, 87 N. Y. 518. This construction also accords with the general theory of the law as to the powers and duties of the various courts, and assigns to each the determination of those questions for the consideration of which it was specially organized and adapted.
The review of questions of fact arising upon conflicting evidence is beyond the general powers of this court, and the consideration of such questions can only be entertained either in civil or criminal cases by force of express provisions of law requiring it. Matter of Ross (supra). The general object and design of the Code of Criminal Procedure was to collect the various statutes relating to the subject and to furnish a uniform, harmonious and comprehensive system of criminal practice, to apply to and govern all criminal proceedings thereafter instituted in any of the courts of the state. Code Crim. Pro. Â§ 962. We should have been more reluctant in arriving at the conclusion that we had no power to review the facts in a criminal case, if a perusal of the evidence given upon this trial had left any doubt in our minds as to the justice of the result attained in the court below.
That evidence tended to prove a homicide committed under circumstances showing a wanton disregard of the sanctity of human life, and the obligations of care and protection which, as master of a household, the defendant owed to those belonging to his family circle;
The evidence tended to show that he was a person of idle and dissolute habits, and regardless of the feelings or interests of others. ,On the day of the homicide, he visited the rooms occupied by himself and family at about noon, and requested his wife to wash his feet.
The wife, who was then in attendance upon her child lying dangerously sick in the room, neglected to comply with this request, and the deceased, who was present, remarked to the defendant that he ought to have more thought for his dying baby.
The defendant replied to this remark with some profanity, and with apparent anger. He soon- thereafter left the house and having pledged his Coat to purchase a pistol, loaded it, and returned to the house where the deceased was employed in her work ; soon after entering the room where the deceased and his wife were sitting, he fatally shot the deceased with the pistol he had just purchased and loaded, and then tried to conceal himself under the bed.
The conduct of the defendant immediately after the shooting, was marked with great levity and indifference, and his conversation immediately thereafter indicated that the act of shooting was intentional and premeditated. We cannot doubt that the jury arrived at a correct result upon the evidence, and we feel no disposition to interfere with their verdict.
We have not omittel to observe, that a week after the trial, when the defendant was brought before the court for sentence, his counsel moved for a new trial upon the evidence, and for an alleged error in the charge to the jury, and upon the refusal of the court to grant a new trial, took an exception to such refusal.
An exception to a charge taken after the trial had terminated, and where, if erroneous, the jury could not have been instructed to disregard the erroneous instructions, does not present any question of law for the consideration of an appellate court. Mathews v. Meyberg, 63 N. Y. 656. Even if this exception had been taken at the proper time, it would have been unavailing, for the reason that we think the charge was unexceptionable. s
A jury would have the right to infer that the evidence of an eye-witness to a transaction would not be favorable to a party who voluntarily excluded such witness from testifying in the case. Gordon v. People, 33 N. Y. 508.
The judgment should be affirmed.

1164430,PEOPLE v. BOAS,1883-06,"Eael, J.
The defendant was an inspector of election in the city of New York at the election held in the fall of 1881, and he was subsequently indicted and convicted in the General Sessions of the same city for declining to receive the vote of an elector at that election under section 67 of chapter 675 of the Laws of 1872, which provides that â€œEvery inspector of election who shall willfully exclude any vote duly tendered, knowing that the person offering the same is lawfully entitled to vote at such election,â€?shall upon conviction thereof be adjudged guilty of a felony and be punished by imprisonment in a state prison for not more than two years.
He appealed from the judgment against him to the General Term of the Supreme Court, and there the judgment was reversed and a new trial was ordered. The General Term order does not state upon what ground or for what reason the judgment was. reversed, and we have now to determine whether there is anything before ns for review upon this appeal. This court is strictly an appellate court, and its general jurisdiction is confined to the correction of errors of law presented in the records brought before it.
Unless it is otherwise specially provided it will never review mere questions of fact depending upon conflicting evidence,, or the exercise of a discretion confided to the- inferior courts.
Section 527 of .the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that â€?the appellate court may order a new trial if it be satisfied that the verdict against the prisoner- was against the weight of evidence or against law, or that justice requires a new trial, whether any exceptions shall have been taken or not in the court below.â€?We have just decided that this, section is confined in its. operation to the Supreme Court, and that it has no- application to-this court. People v. Hovey (ante, p. 288)*.
The section clothes the Supreme Court with power,.in the exercise of its discretion, to- order a new trial when it shall be- satisfied that the verdict is against the weight of evidence, or that justice requires- a new trial; and when in the exercise- of its discretion it shall under the section refuse or grant a new trial,, its determination is not reviewable here.
Under section 519, the people may appeal to this court from a judgment of the General Term reversing a judgment of conviction but such an appeal brings before us for review only questions of law. How are we to ascertain where the people have appealed that the reversal was upon questions of law only ? Simply by looking at the record. The opinion of the General Term forms no part of that, and we cannot look at it for the grounds of the reversal. We must look for them in the order of the General Term, and that must show that the Supreme Court lias exercised its discretion, and that the new trial was ordered for errors of law only.
In a case like this the appeal comes before us- substantially . in the same way that an appeal comes here from an order of the General Term of the Supreme Court granting a new trial ini a civil action, after the verdict of a jury in a case- where that court had the power to grant a new trial in the exercise of its discretion on .the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence. In such case.we have uniformly held that there was nothing for this court to review unless it appeared that the Supreme Court had exercised its discretion and had refused a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence and had granted it solely for error of law. Wright v. Hunter, 46 N. Y. 509; Harris v. Burdett, 73 Id. 136; Srebley v. Conner, 78 Id. 218.
We cannot .say, therefore, that the court below committed any error of law, as the new tidal may have been ordered, in the .exercise of its discretion, under .section 527; and its order must therefore be affirmed.
All concur.

By the indictment the defendant was charged with having feloniously stolen from the person of Catharine Curtis, treasury notes, bank notes, and coin amounting to the sum of about $21.50. And for the purpose of proving the truth of the charge, it was shown that she had taken from a reticule in a ladyâ€™s hand' in Macyâ€™s store a â€˜pocket-book containing $10 in bills and $l'.10dn silver. This was taken apparently without the knowledge of the person having the- reticule, and upon her detection, which immediately succeeded the taking, the conduct of the defendant was such as must have led the jury to the conclusion that she- intended to steal the pocket-book and its contents. The person charged by the indictment to have been the owner of the property was not produced as a witness upon the trial, and substantially because of the absence of her testimony that the pocket-book had not been taken against her will, it was objected that the evidence was so deficient as not to justify a conviction of the defendant. But it was not necessary for this purpose that the person should be produced as a witness upon the trial, for the facts that the property was taken without her consent and that the defendant intended to steal it, could be established by the circumstances appealing to have attended the taking, if they were sufficient, as they appear to have been, to convince the jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that they were as they had been alleged in the indictment. The law does not require for either of these purposes that the person whose property may have been stolen shall be produced as a witness. 2 Bishop Crim. Pro. 3 ed. Â§ 722.
Even where it has been required to be stated as an attribute of the offense that the act was committed without the consent of the owner of the property, it has still been held that this want of consent, could be inferred from the circumstances attending and following the commission of the act. Rex v. Hazy, 2 Car. & P. 458. In this case the indictment was for lopping and topping an ash tree without the consent of the owner, and the rule already stated was held to be properly, relied upon to justify a conviction, although the owner himself was not produced as a witness in the case.
Rex v. Allen, 1 Moody C. C. 154, is precisely the same in its effect. There the charge was that the prisoner had killed a deer without the consent of the owner, and upon a case reserved, it was held by the twelve judges that a conviction was rightly had without calling the owner to Â¡Drove the want of consent.
It was further objected that it was not shown that the person from whom the pocket-book was taken, was the' Catharine Curtis named in the indictment, but it appeared that she gave that as her name in the store after the defendant had been detected in taking the pocket-book and also swore to it before the committing magistrate, and her son in law who â–?identified the pocket-book to be the same as the one which had been taken and produced upon the trial, testified that he gave it to her and saw it in her possession on the day on which it was taken. It may have been true that she gave this pocket-book to some other person and that it was taken from the possession of that person by the defendant, as her counsel has argued the case to be ; but a mere possibility of this nature is not sufficient to justify the conclusion that the qirestion of the identity of this individual with the person named in the indictment was not a proper one for the consideration and decision of the jury. The prosecution were not bound to prove beyond the possibility of doubt that she was the person mentioned in the indictment, but evidence, from which that could be inferred to be the fact beyond a reasonable doubt was all that the law required. The identity of the name itself was quite decisive as to the identity of the person. People v. Smith, 45 N. Y. 772, 779.
And that, together with the other evidence in the case, left no reasonable ground from which it could have been supposed that the Catharine Curtis named in the indictment was any other or different person than the person from whose possession the property had been taken in the store.
It was also objected that the pocket-book produced was not shown to be the pocket-book taken from the person named in the indictment. The evidence to that fact was that when the defendant was detected in taking the pocket-book and immediately arrested for that act, she threw it into an umbrella stand from which it was taken by a person in attendance upon the store, and it was identified in its passage after that from hand to hand down to the time when it was produced upon the trial. The evidence which was given, accordingly left no reasonable ground from which it could be claimed that the pocket-book present at the trial or its contents were any other than that taken by the defendant from the reticule in the ladyâ€™s hand, but it was so direct and complete in its character and so connected as to be clear proof of that fact. Upon all points the evidence was sufficient as it was held to be, to submit the case to the decision of the jury.
In its submission the judge presiding at the trial stated to the jury that the point is raised that Catherine Curtis, mother-in-law of Mr. Sophia, may not have been the Catharine Curtis from whom the pocket-book was taken, If there is no mistake about the statement of Mr. Sophia who says he saw this same pocket-book in his mother-in-lawâ€™s hands on that dayâ€”that is a circumstance tending to show that Mrs. Catharine Curtis is the mother-in-law of the witness, and the Catharine Curtis charged in the indictment is the owner of the pocket-book. And to that an exception was taken by the defendantâ€™s counsel and that ex-' ception is supposed to be sustained by what was said in Mc-Kenna v. People, 81 N. Y. 300. But that clearly is not the effect of this decision, for all that the judge stated was that the fact that the son-in-law saw the same pocket-book in his mother-in-lawâ€™s hand on the day on which it was taken, was a circumstance tending to show that his mother-in-law was the person charged in the indictment to be the owner of the pocket-book. The jury were in no manner controlled or directed concerning the force and effect of this circumstance as proof of the fact, but that was left wholly to their consideration, and in that respect the charge differed materially from the statement held to have been improper in the case just cited. For there it was held that the jury -were controlled in their inferences to be made from the evidence by the statement made to them by the court. They were subjected to no such control in this case, but the circumstance mentioned was simply brought to their attention as one tending to prove the identity of the person from whom the pocket-book was taken with the person named in the indictment and it did have a tendency to establish that fact.
These are the only points upon which the conviction of the defendant has been assailed. The evidence was abundant to carry them all to the jury including the one last considered arising upon the charge, and as to that the proper province of the the judge was not exceeded. The judgment from which the appeal has been taken should be consequently affirmed.

The proof was ample to convict the defendant of the crime for which she was indicted,-and there was no error in the charge of the judge. It was not necessary for the people to call Mrs.. Curtis as a witness. There was sufficient evidence that she was the person in Macyâ€™s store; that she owned the pocket-book, and that the defendant took it from her against her will, and without her consent, for the purpose of stealing it.

1164432,PEOPLE v. BURTON,1883-01,"Smith, P. J.
The indictment in this case charged the appellant with breaking and Ã©ntering the salt block of John C. Keefe, in the city of Syracuse, and stealing therefrom certain salt kettles. The crime was alleged to have been committed in October, 1881.
The facts of the case, as shown by uncontradicted evidence, are as follows: The defendant, who is a son of Burr Burton, deceased, bought the salt block in question from the executors of the estate of his father, in 1867, and took a deed from them, 11 and executed a mortgage back, for a part of the purchase'money. The defendant took possession, and ""in 1879, put into the block several salt kettles, including those which' he is charged with stealing. They were put in for the purpose of being used by the defendant in the manufacture of salt, and they were set in arches of masonry, a portion of which had to be removed, in order to get the kettles out. Subsequently, the mortgage was foreclosed, and the block was sold, but the defendant claimed that he was still the owner of the kettles which he had put in subsequently to the execution of the mortgage. He took legal advice on the subject, and was advised that he had a right to take the kettles away. Accordingly, he went to the premises, in the day time, entered by an open door, and with the assistance of two cartmen whom he took with him, he removed the kettles, breaking-so much of the masonry as was necessary for the purpose, carried the kettles away and sold them. The agent of the owner of the block, who had charge of it, was present when the kettles were removed, and conversed with the defendant while the men were getting the kettles out. The defendantâ€™s counsel moved at the close of the evidence for the discharge of his client, on the ground that there was no evidence to warrant a conviction. The motion was denied, and the defendant excepted.
The judge charged that the evidence did not warrant a conviction of burglary, but he instructed the jury that if the defendant took the kettles with intent to steal them, he was guilty of larceny.
We think the judge erred in submitting the question of larceny to the jury. He should have instructed them that there was no evidence to warrant a conviction for that offense. The uncontradicted evidence repels the idea that the defendant acted animo furandi. At most, he was but a trespasser, assuming that the kettles were personal property and that his claim to them was unfounded. Again, if the kettles were not the property of the defendant, it was because they had been affixed to the realty and had become a part of it, so that they passed under the mortgage.
In that case, assuming that there was evidence of an intent to steal, the offense consisted of severing and taking away from the building â€?a part thereof, or some material of which it was formed,â€?with the intent aforesaid. An offense of that nature is not larceny, unless the property severed exceeds twenty-five dollars in value. 2 R. S. 680, Â§ 68. The verdict of the jury convicting the defendant of petit larceny, established the fact that the property was not of that value.
The most that could have been claimed by the public prosecutor under the circumstances last suggested is, that the act of the defendant amounted to a misdemeanor under 2 B. 8. 693, Â§ 15, but for that offense he was not indicted or convicted. Comfort v. Fulton, 39 Barb. 56.
The judgment and conviction should be reversed, and a new trial ordered in the Onondaga Court of Sessions.

1164433,AUGSBURY v. PEOPLE,1883-01,"Hardin, J.
After the prisonerâ€™s case in defense had been put in, the prosecution called Dr. Trowbridge and examined him, and he testified :
(1) That he had examined the prisoner on three occasions â€?since his incarceration in jail* especially with regard to the condition of his mind, and that lie did not notice anything in the examination of the prisoner on those three different occasions to indicate insanity.â€?(2) After the witness had read the testimony of Nancy Augsbury and of Justus Chase, two witnesses who had given evidence touching the mental condition of the prisoner, he was asked if the â€?symptoms described are indications of insanity,â€?and his answer was that they were not.
In the course of the cross-examination of this witness, he was asked the following question, and to it the objections stated were made, and the objections taken were sustained and an exception taken.
The questions, objections and ruling appear in the case viz.: â€?Q. Supposing a man, on a bright day, in the morning, in plain sight of a frequently traveled road, goes into a field where three of his neighbors are at work, with whom he never has had any trouble, never has threatened any personal violence against them in any way; that he passes one of these parties who says: â€?Good morning, uncle Dave,â€?and he bows in return; he passes on to another of the neighbors who is working with a team in the field ; that he says to him, â€?Sam, I see you are at it again;â€?Sam replies in substance, â€?I have got the farm, and got to get in my crops;â€?before he finishes that sentence, the prisoner shoots him through the chest; he then turns around and fires at the person he has passed, shooting him through the fleshy part of the arm; he .then turned to the person whom he addressed as Sam, says to him again, â€?Sam, you have commenced this thing, now we must have blood for blood,â€?and shoots him again in the hip; the other of those neighbors rushes up calling on him to stop, attempted to unfasten the horses, who are restive, from the drag; as he stoops down, he shoots him in the hip, and as he rises, in the shoulder; then passes off and passes on to his house, and goes deliberately to the jail; would you say that was any indication of insanity?â€?Objected to by the prosecution that there is no foundation laid for it in the evidence, and secondly as re-opening the defense. Objection sustained. Defense except.
If the ruling rested upon the objection that the defense could not re-open the case, and was made in the reasonable exercise of the discretion of the trial court, we could not review it to any advantage of the plaintiff in error, unless we could say there had been an abuse of discretion. Williams v. Sargent, 46 N. Y. 483 ; People v. Cook, 4 Seld. 67.
So, too, if the ruling is sustainable it must be upheld on the precise grounds specified at the trial. Tooley v. Bacon, 70 N. Y. 34; Matter of Crosby v. Day, 81 Id. 245.
Before we can say that the ruling was justifiable upon the ground that the defense had no right to re-open the case, we must determine that the evidence was not allowable for the purpose of testing the skill and the capacity and the opinion of the expert.
We think for the latter purpose it was admissible and a legitimate question to be put for such a purpose. Therefore, there is no force in the objection that â€?no foundation had been laid for it â€?in the evidence. After the very general opinions given by the Dr. Trowbridge, based upon personal examinations of the prisoner and upon the evidence of two of his important witnesses, adverse to the defense interposed, there was the jnost ample foundation laid for a thorough searching and critical cross-examination of the witness.
The question propounded was hypothetical, and evidently intended to be based upon the evidence in the case and the theory maintained by the prisoners counsel as to the evidence offered, and therefore the question was allowable. Cowley v. People, 83 N. Y. 465 ; Guiterman v. L. S. Co., 83 Id. 366 ; Dilleber v. Home Ins. Co., 87 Id. 83.
The defendant in error, is not in a situation to say that some slight mistake was made in reciting the evidence alluded to in the hypothetical question. That position would not accord with the doctrine of the cases we have quoted. Besides, it must be assumed that no such position was taken before the trial court, as it does not appear in the objections there taken, and to them the people must be now confined.
We cannot say that the erroneous ruling with which we are dealing caused no harm to the prisoner.
Dr. Trowbridge had given very important evidence upon the essential points of the defense, and the counsel of the prisoner in preserving the rights of the prisoner adopted a mode in his cross-examination that has the sanction of almost an every day practice in the leading trials of criminals when expert testimony is used.
Upon the evidence in the case as it has come to ns, there is much tending to support the defense of insanity and we are not at liberty to say that the error we pointed out worked no harm to the plaintiff in error. He is entitled to have a jury pass upon his defense when they have heard all the evidence fro and con, witnesses tested and sifted according to the rules for examination and cross-examination. The latter ought not in such a case as this to be unduly cut off, by too strict rulings or too narrow a range of discretion.
For the error we have pointed out, we are of the opinion a new trial should be granted.
Conviction and judgment reversed and proceedings remitted to the Court of Sessions of Jefferson county with directions for a new trial.

1164421,PEOPLE v. CORNETTI,1883-03,"Andrews, J.
The defendant was convicted at the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Westchester county, held in June, 1882, of the crime of murder in the first degree, in killing one Daniel Cash, by stabbing, in the mess room of the state .prison at Sing Sing on the ,31st day of December, 1881. The prisoner and Cash were convicts in the prison at the time of the homicide, and were assigned to duty in the mess room. The evidence shows that on the morning of the day of the homicide, another prisoner, after sharpening a case knife used by him laid it down and went to another part of the room. The prisoner was within a few feet of the place where the knife was left, in a position where he could have seen it. The convict who sharpened and left the knife, returned after a short absence to the place where he had left it and found that it had been taken away. In a few moments the prisoner was seen to-approach the deceased, and when he came near him struck him twice in the neck with a knife. The deceased immediately cried out that he was cut, and started to leave the room. He was taken to the hospital and died in about twenty minutes. It was found that the knife had severed the internal jugular vein.
The knife with which the blow was struck was taken from the hands of the prisoner. It was identified as the one which had been sharpened and laid down by the convict before referred to. Two witnesses of the transaction testified that no words passed between the prisoner and deceased before the homicide, and that there was no assault or provocation by the latter.
The evidence on the part of the people does not disclose any motive for the homicide.
It appears that the prisoner and the deceased had been witnesses. on the trial of another convict by' the name of Mongano, on opposite sides, but whether any ill feeling between them grew out of this circumstance does not appear. The prisoner was examined on his own behalf and testified that the deceased before the day of the homicide called him bad names, and had threatened to kill him, and that, just before the homicide had struck him and drew a knife upon him. The question whether the killing was in self-defense or under an apprehension on the part of the prisoner'of personal injury was submitted to the jury.
The case as presented upon the record leaves no doubt upon our minds that it was one of deliberate and premeditated murder, and no other reasonable conclusion could have been reached by the jury,
Twro exceptions- were taken by the prisonerâ€™s counsel on impanelling the jury. The juror Onderdonk was challenged by the prisonerâ€™s counsel for principal cause, and testified on his examination- in chief that he had read and talked about the case and had formed' an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, but he subsequently declared in substance that such opinion would not, as -he believed, influence his verdict, and that he could render an impartial verdict according to the evidence. The' court, therefore, overruled the challenge, and the juror was sworn. The exception taken to this ruling is answered by section 376 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which is a re-enactment of chapter 475 of the Laws of 1875, which was considered in Balboâ€™s Case, 80 N. Y. 484.
In the case of the' juror Harris, the same ruling wras made under similar circumstances, but this juror was peremptorily challenged by the prisonerâ€™s counsel and did not sit in the case. The point is here taken that the court of Oyer and Terminer, by which the prisoner was tried, was not legally constituted, the allegation being that the justices of the sessions, who in part-composed it, were not legally designated or elected.
This point is taken here for the first time. It was not jaised at the trial, and there is no evidence and no exception bearing upon it. It must be assumed, therefore, that the court was properly constituted, and that the justices of the sessions, who acted, were duly designated according to law.
There are no other points presented as ground of reversal, and no other exceptions of any moment beside those considered.
There is no error in the judgment, and it should therefore be affirmed.

1164435,PEOPLE v. DUFF; PEOPLE v. FITZGERALD,1883-05,"Westbbook, J.
On May 7, 1883, prior to the attempt .to organize a grand jury for the Court of Oyer and Terminer of the county of Albany, which on that day began-its session, and before the individuals who had been summoned to attend such court in the capacity of grand jurors had been accepted or sworn as such, each of the above named defendants, who had severally given bail to answer any indictment which might then be found, by counsel, objected to such individuals, collectively and severally, as grand jurors, and moved to set aside and discharge the entire number, because each and every one had been obtained pursuant to the provisions of chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881, entitled â€œAn act to amend section one thousand and forty-one of the Code of Civil Procedure,â€?and not a single one had been drawn or obtained in the manner prescribed by the Revised Statutes, from a list of names made out and selected as therein required.
The counsel for the defendants insisted that the act of 1881, so far as it professed to provide for the selection and obtainment of gratid jurors in the county of Albany, was unconstitutional and void, because it was a local law, applicable to the county of Albany only, and, therefore, forbidden by article 3, section 18, of the State constitution, which prevents the passage by the legislature of a private or local bill for â€?selecting, drawing, summoning or impanelling grand or petit jurors,â€?unless the same had been reported to the legislature (section 25 of same article) â€?by commissioners, who have been appointed pursuant to law to revise the statutes,â€?and that this bill had not been so reported.
The district-attorney conceded the facts upon which the objection was based, and admitted that the persons attending the court as grand jurors had been obtained pursuant to the act of 1881, and not in the manner prescribed by the Revised Statutes; and also that chapter 532, of the Laws of 1881, had not been reported to the legislature by the commissioners appointed to revise the statutes. The district-attorney, however, insisted that the men present, and each of them, were competent to serve as grand jurors, and had been drawn from the only box or list of grand jurors kept or made in and for the county of Albany, and had been duly summoned by the sheriff of the county, and that the objections made should be overruled.
It was then agreed between counsel in open court, that the objections made on the part of the defendants to the proposed grand jurors should not then be disposed of, and that if an indictment was found against either of the defendants or both of them, that the questions involved in such objections should be argued and disposed of in the same manner as if argued and decided before the organization of the grand jury.
An indictment, or what purports to be one, has been presented against each of the defendants, and the objections made prior to the attempt to organize the grand jury have been submitted to the court, after arguments for a decision. It is somewhat difficult to say what should be the form of the order to be made in these cases, if the objections are sustained, as the decision must'be after indictment. Passing this difficulty, however, for the present, the questionâ€”what should have been the decision of the court upon the objections, if they had been disposed of when made?-â€”will be first considered.
The doubt as to the constitutionality of the Albany jury law (chap. 532 of the Laws of 1881), upon which the objections to the organization of the grand jury were based, has been settled by the Court, of Appeals in the case of People v. P'etrea, a full report of which, both in the General Term and in the Court of Appeals, will be found in 1 New York Criminal Reports, pages 198 to 245, both inclusive. That court held (see opinion of Andrews, J., on page 239) â€?that the act so far as it relates to the selection and drawing of grand jurors is unconstitutional.â€?It was so decided (an offer to prove that the law as a bill had not emanated from the commissioners to revise the statutes ' having been improperly rejected) upon the assumption that it had not been reported from such commission. That question of fact^-the source and origin of the lawâ€”is eliminated from these cases by the concession of the district-attorney, who admits that as a bill it did not originate with, nor was it reported from such commission. The discussion of the questions involved in these objections must, therefore, proceed with the distinct recognition of the fact, that the act of 1881, so far as it relates to the mode and manner of obtaining grand jurors in Albany county, is unconstitutional and void. A corollary, which necessarily follows from the previous fact, must also be borne in mind, and it is this, that as the law is a violation of the Constitution, because it attempts to obtain grand jurors in a mode forbidden by that instrument, that eacli and every person attending the court to serve as a grand juror was forbidden to serve as such by tiie fundamental law. This corollary follows, or else the Constitution is a dead letter. Of what avail is a constitutional prohibition against legislation, if the machinery of such confessed unconstitutional legislation can still be used and upheld against the party whom it affects ? To me, the proposition seems strange, that a body of men, or any men, selected and obtained by methods forbidden by the Constitution, no matter how fair, impartial, or well qualified for the functions which they assume they rnay be, can be organized into a grand jury and place in jeopardy the life and liberty of the citizens. If this can be done, then constitutional guards for the most sacred rights of man can be stricken down by a single blow. To this grave questionâ€”can a citizen avail himself in any way of a constitutional provision which forbids men, obtained in a certain manner, from serving as grand jurors %â€?we are brought, and it deserves the most careful attention.
It has already been stated, that the Court of Appeals has decided that the law, by which the men who are objected to as grand jurors were obtained, was unconstitutional and void. This fact is conceded by the district-attorney, but he also insists that the decision in the Pet rea case establishes the doctrine, that no matter by what methods or process the men summoned as grand jurors are obtained, though in fact their presence is secured by modes forbidden by the Constitution, so long as individuals they possess the statute qualifications of grand jurors, the accused is without remedy. If this proposition has been held by our court of dernier resort, it must be adopted as the law of these cases, without any regard to the individual views of the judge presiding in this tribunal. Has any such doctrine been held in the Potrea case 2 ' To that question discussion will now be directed.
Prior to the decision in the Petrea case it was supposed by the judge writing this opinion, that to constitute a valid grand jury, it was not sufficient that a number of men competent to serve as members thereof assembled in the presence of the court, and were accepted by the tribunal as competent grand jurors, but that as the selection of men to serve as such was most important for the protection of the rights of the citizen, that the selection of those in attendance must have been in conformity with law. The upright administration of criminal justice would seem, at least, to depend very largely upon the observance of every safeguard imposed by law.for the choice of grand jurors, in order to secure their absolute impartiality and freedom from all bias, or sinister motive. If called upon to define what a legal grand jury is, the answer required, would seem to me, to be this: A body of men selected, chosen, and summoned according to and in the manner prescribed by law, to serve as grand jurors before and at a competent court, and by such court impanelled, sworn and charged to enquire in regard to crime committed within their jurisdiction, and to present all offenders against the law in the mode and manner defined by it. The selection of its members is, as has already been . said, a most important and vital point to be observed ; aiid the Code of Criminal Procedure has expressly declared (Â§ 229) that â€?The mode of selecting, grand jurors is prescribed by special statutes.â€?What is the effect of this provision other than the utterance of a legislative command that â€?the mode of selecting grand jurors prescribed by special statutes â€?shall be followed %
When a method of procedure is pointed out Â¿s â€?the â€?one to be adopted, is not every other ..excluded by force of the maxim, â€?JSxpressio unius est exclusio alteriusf â€?If such mode has not been followed, and the selection of the members of a grand jury has been not only without the authority of law,but in defiance of its positive commands (for section 18 of article 3 of the Constitution to be effective must operate as a prohibition against the obtainment of a grand jury under a local statute), can a presentment made by a body of men thus obtained accuse any person of a crime so as to subject him to a trial therefor % When the act of 1881 was adopted by the legislature and approved by the governor, there was in full force in the county of Albany a system for selecting and obtaining grand jurorsâ€”that of the Revised Statutesâ€”which that act was designed to overthrow and supplant. That attempt failed, as the Court of Appeals has held, because it was a violation of the Constitution. When, therefore, old and valid laws still operative for the obtainment of a grand jury are disregarded, and a new, unlawful and forbidden enactment is obeyed in its selection, what possible vitality or life can an organization thus set on foot obtain ? (See in this connection the opinion of the Chancellor in People v. White, 24 Wend. 539, 540, 541, 542, as to the distinction between de facto officers of a tribunal â€?duly organized,â€?and of the â€?de facto officers of an unconstitutional and therefore illegally organized court; â€?also Hildreth v. McIntyre, 1 J. J. Marshall, 206, 207, 208, 209; also Green v. State, 59 Md. 125, in which the Court of Appeals of that state, per Ieving, J., says: â€?The general method prescribed for drawing juries is mandatory, and substantial compliance with the provisions thereof in respect to the selection and drawing of jurors are necessary to make the jury a legal one; and unless the selections are made by the judge in the manner pointed out by the statute, exception, at the proper time, and in the proper way, may be successfully taken to a jury improperly chosen or drawn; otherwise the statutory provisions would be wholly nugatory;â€?also Dutell v. State, 4 Greene (Iowa), 125, which was to review the denial of a motion â€?to quash the indictment â–?on the ground that the grand jurors who found it were not selected according to law.â€?The court says per Gbeene, J.: â€?But it is urged by the attorney-general, that the defendant .cannot raise this objection after the indictment is found, but that he should have challenged the panel of the grand jury as provided by section 2882 of the Code. This course may be adopted with propriety by a defendant held to answer for a public offense; but can it be expected that citizens at large, against whom there is no imputation of offense, are required to appear and challenge the panel of grand jurors, or be forever precluded from raising an objection to their selection or authority to act? It is true, as a general rule, that when the indictment is duly exhibited in open court and indorsed 6 a true bill,â€?it is evidence that it was duly found by a legal grand jury. But â– when the records of a county show that the grand jurors were not legally selected, and had no authority to act, it is evidence of a higher grade, and shows that the indictment could not have been found, exhibited, and indorsed by legal authority,â€?also Hitter v. State, likewise reported in 4 Greene, 291, and see opinion of court on formation of grand jury, on pages 292, 293; also State v. Symonds, 36 Maine, 128, which was a case presenting the identical question of that of Petrea. The defendant had filed a plea in abatement to the alleged indictment, that it had been found by a grand jury not selected as the statute provided. The plea was overruled, and he was required to answer upon the merits. He pleaded not guilty, and on trial was convicted. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, upon the ground that the grand jury, not having been legally selected, could present no valid indictment. The court, per Howard, J., saying, among other things, â€?Every indictment must be found by a grand jury legally selected, and duly constituted and competent for the purpose; â€?also Doyle v. State, 17 Ohio, 222. In that case, an indictment purported to have been found by fifteen grand jurors, which was the exact number requisite to make a grand jury. To the alleged indictment the prisoner pleaded a special plea, that one of the fifteen grand jurors did not have the statute qualifications of grand jurors. To this plea there was a demurrer, which was sustained by the trial court. On writ of error the Supreme Court of Ohio reversed the conviction, and the court, per Read, J., pages 224, 225, 226, after stating the organization of the grand jury, said : â€?Hence no indictment in this case was ever found by a grand jury, because there was no grand jury to pass upon it. Hence that which purports to be an indictment was no indictment, and the party charged could not be put upon trial to answer. It should have been quashed or set aside as a nullity. But it is said the objection comes too late. Ho objection can come too late, which discloses the fact that a person has been put to answer a crime in a mode violating his legal and constitutional rights. The doctrine of waiver has nothing to do with criminal prosecutions. Ho person can be put upon his defense on the charge of crime, or be convicted of crime, except in the exact mode prescribed by law. . . . What an indictment is, is matter of law. Who shall constitute a grand jury, how it shall be summoned, composed and organized, is all matter of positive law. Ho man can, by his consent or will, constitute a grand jury. Ho man, by express consent, can confer jurisdiction upon the court to try him for crime. Ho man by express consent, can make that indictment, authorizing the court to try that which, in fact, is no indictmentalso Barney v. State, reported in 12 Smedes & Marshall, 68, in which the High Court of Errors and Appeals of Mississippi, decided in the same way in a precisely similar case; also White v. Commonwealth, 6 Binney 179, in which a conviction for murder was reversed, because the precept to summon the grand and petit jurors omitted to order the latter to be summoned from the county in which the court was held, and the return of the sheriff did not affirmatively show that the trial jurors were summoned from such county; also Rawkinsâ€?Pleas of the Grown, book 2, ch. 25, Â§Â§ 16, 26, 28). It is useless, however, to pursue this discussion. It has progressed thus far without intending in the slightest degree with a fault-finding spirit to criticise the opinion of the Court of Appeals in the Petrea case, which will be adopted and followed ; but simply and only to show the extent to which the position of the learned district-attorney goes, who occupies the extreme ground that the accused has no right to object at any stage of the proceeding to the fact that a so-called grand jury has been organized for his prosecution in a mode forbidden by the Constitution. The proposition is certainly startling, but it needs examination. Has the Court of Appeals held in the Petrea case that if the objections which were made after indictment, had been made prior to the organization of the grand jury, they would have been unavailing?
Judge Andrews (1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 243) says: â€?The jury which found the indictment was a de facto jury selected and organized under the forms of law. The defect- in its contitution, owing to the invalidity of the law of 1881, affected no substantial right of the defendant. We confine our decision upon this point to the case presented by-this record, and hold that an indictment found by a grand jury of good and lawful men, selected and drawn under color of law, is a good indictment by a grand jury within the sense of the Constitution, although the law under which the selection was made is void. It will be time to consider the extreme cases suggested by counsel when occasion shall arise.â€?It is not now proposed to discuss, whether or not a defacto grand jury can exist at all, when its existence as organized, by the methods and machinery employed, is a violation of the Constitution ; nor to maintain the proposition that a body upon which power is conferred must, to exercise that power, be organized and formed as the law directs, and that while the possessor of an office may as a de facto officer wield the power of the office,-yet there can be no such thing as a de facto court or jury, when organized without and against the law; nor to consider whether or not a grand jury can be said to be selected and drawn under â€?color of law,â€?when the Constitution expressly says its members shall not be selected and drawn in the .mode and by the machinery they were in fact drawn and selected; All these questions must, by this tribunal, be deemed settled, and they are only now suggested to submit in the most respectful manner to the court of dernier ressort, whether or not the opinion in the Potrea case is carried too far?
But it is insisted, that the Court of Appeals has not yet decided that if a body of men-has been obtained in an illegal manner for a grand jury, that an objection, taken by a person whose case is to be considered by it' before the organization of the grand jury is made, would be unavailing. That court has held, that after an indictment has been found by a body of men who, one and all, possess the statute requirements of grand jurors, organized and accepted by a competent court, without objection, as such, that an objection to the manner of their selection is unavailing. They have held, that there may be a de facto grand jury, whose work when completed may be valid; but they have not said that it was the duty of the court to create a defacto grand jury by the machinery of a void statute, when its attention was drawn to the fact, and objection made to its being done. Further than this, as has been stated, has not been held. On the contrary, the court say, â€?We coniine our decision upon this point to the case presented by this record ; â€?and also, â€?It will be time to consider the extreme cases suggested by counsel when occasion shall arise.â€?What â€?the extreme eases . . . suggested by counselâ€?were, is not known. Certain it is, that, this motion presents an extreme case, for the court is asked by persons who were under recognizances there to appear and to answer to any indictment which might be found, and, therefore, interested vitally in the organization of a grand jury, to set aside and not place in such a body men who had been selected by machinery and in a manner which the law forbade. Can a judge or court, to which such an appeal is made, disregard it? Can a judge presiding at a court, who knows that the individuals there attending as grand jurors, have been selected under an unconstitutional and void statute, and not in â€œthe modeâ€?prescribed â€œby special statutes,â€?still in force, when his attention is called to what has been done, disregard the appeal, and proceed to organize the grand jury without the slightest regard to the Constitution, which he has sworn to support ?
These are certainly questions as grave as any which can be propounded to a tribunal for decisipn. An executive officer may appoint an individual to fill an office, which is vacant, to do which he has no authority, and yet the officer may, as a de facto one in possession of the office, effectually wield the functions thereof; but would that fact justify the executive in making an appointment which he knew lie had no power to make ? It is possible, for the Court of Appeals has so decided, for a court to organize a grand jury by the machinery of an unconstitutional law, and an indictment by such a body, when found without objection, is good; but what possible protection does that, fact afford to a court for organizing- it contrary to the Constitution, when it knows that by so doing it violates that instrument ? Can it be gravely argued that a court, which is informed by the decision of the highest tribunal of the state, that the individuals then attending to serve as grand jurors have been chosen and obtained by unconstitutional and forbidden methods, with which opinion its own, on full and careful examination, agrees, must, with open eyes, deliberately and against an objection plainly made, accept such men as grand jurors and proceed to organize a grand jury, to the end that a de facto body of that character should be formed ? Grant that the work of such a body can be effectual, yet can that relieve the court which has, in defiance of law, conferred upon it as a body that power ? It is one thing to hold that authority to act has been given, but it is quite a different thing to hold that the power conferred should, under the law, have been conferred. If the court of last resort decides that on objection made to the organization of a grand jury, this court can legally and properly uphold and use the machinery of a law to obtain the members thereof, which the Legislature was forbidden to pass, and disregard. legal enactments for their obtainment which are still in force and unrepealed, then this court, as now organized, will cheerfully obey, for the opinions of that court make the law for the guidance of the lower tribunals. Until, however, that court has so held, the responsibility of overruling objections so clear, and thus plainly and palpably violating the Constitution of the state, cannot be assumed:
The learned district-attorney has also argued that the objections made to the organization of the grand jury amount to a challenge â€?to the panel or to the array of the grand jury,â€?which is forbidden by section 238 of the Code of Criminal Pro-' ced'ure, and that therefore they cannot avail. If the true construction of this section is that which is claimed, it is then proper to consider what force the section itself can possibly have. The Constitution of the state (article 1, Â§ 6) has said: â€œLfo person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime â€?(with certain exceptions therein contained, none of them, however, being applicable to these cases), â€?unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury.â€?It is true that the Constitution has not defined what a legal grand jury is. and the attempt has been made in the prior part of this opinion to show, both on reason and authority, that it means a body â–?of men, the members of which have been selected, chosen and summoned according to the provisions of law regulating such selection, choice and summoning. There is, however, another argument upon this subject worthy of a separate statement, for from its force, there seems to me to be no escape, and it is this : While it is true the Constitution has not said how a grand jury shall be obtained.and organized, in order to find an indictment, which shall be sufficient and valid to compel a party â€?to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime,â€?yet it has declared what shall not be a lawful grand jury to accomplish that result. The eighteenth section of its third article, by its prohibition to"" the Legislature from passing a local bill for â€?selecting, drawing, summoning or impanelling grand or petit jurors,â€?has expressly forbidden its organization under any enactment which disregards that constitutional prohibition. B.y no possibility can it be said that the Constitution intends'to call that a legal grand jury, which it has, if due force be given to .all its provisions, directly declared shall not be one. It is true that section eighteen of article three is an enactment by the people, subsequent to section six of article one, and that prior to the adoption of such section eighteen of article three, there was no constitutional declaration to the effect that a grand jury, obtained in any particular way, was not a lawful grand jury, and incapable to find a valid indictment, to which the party indicted could be compelled to answer; but the two now form parts of the same one instrument and must be construed together as the present command of the sovereign power to the tribunals which it has created. ""
It is not necessary, in the present cases, to demonstrate that the pretended law, under the so-called machinery of which the individuals, at whom the objections in these cases were aimed, were selected, was repugnant to, and therefore made void and of no effect by the eighteenth section of the third article of our state Constitution. That problem, if one it ever was, was worked out in the opinion written in the Petrea case, and with the conclusion there reachedâ€”that such pretended law was no law, so far as it relates to the grand juryâ€”the Court of Appeals has agreed and stamped upon it the declaration that it is null and void. 'Eegarding and considering, then, the two sections of the Constitution (article 1, Â§ 6, and article 3, Â§ 18) together, what have we for our guidance but a single command by the fundamental law, declaring to this court, and to all courts of the state, you shall not place a person upon trial â€œfor a capital or otherwise infamous crime, . . . unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury,â€?and you shall not obtain such grand jury under the machinery of a local bill passed by the Legislature for â€?selecting, drawing, summoning, or impanelling â€?its members. The Constitution must mean this or nothing, for of what possible practical force can its prohibition to the Legislature be, unless it is extended to the courts, which alone are to use the machinery of laws, which the Legislature enacts ? Without this construction of the fundamental law, the singular spectacle is presented of Ã¡ prohibition to the Legislature from passing a bill, and yet when passed, having all the effect of a valid law, because freely used and made effective by the courts. â–?This court, having been informed by the decision of the Court of Appeals that the individuals before it, who have been summoned to.act as its grand jurors, are there in violation of . the Constitution of the state, cannot, when objections plainly call attention to that fact before their acceptance as grand jurors, organize them into a grand jury; and any statute, which forbids the defendants from raising objections of the character presented, or the court from considering them when made, must and will be regarded as of no force or effect. â€?The court is, however, well satisfied that the author of tlie Code intended no such legal impossibility. Its author, whose fame is worldwide, used the words â€?panel or . . . array of the grand juryâ€?in no such sense as is attributed to them. He used them in their legal sense, and not to designate men who could not possibly be called grand jurors, but only such as were present, who, having been obtained by legal methods, could be called a â€?panel or . . . array of the grand jury.â€?When such a body is present, the right of challenge is limited, but he did not intend to prohibit the court from ascertaining whether or not it had such a body before it. The objections presented are not a challenge in the sense used in section 238, but they go further, and insist that there is no material present which can make a â€?panel â€?or â€?array,â€?and an inquiry to ascertain the truth of such allegation is not forbidden.
There is also another answer to the objections of the district-attorney, and it is thisâ€”while section 238 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has declared : â€?There is no challenge allowed to the panel or to the array of the grand jury,â€?it, nevertheless, also provides that â€?the court may, in its discretion, at any time discharge the grand jury and order another to be summoned,â€?for several causes therein specified, of which the following is one: â€?That the requisite number of ballots was not drawn from the grand jury box of the county.â€?This provision recognizes a legal direction in regard to the number of ballots to be drawn, when a grand jury is to be selected, and the existence of a place of deposit of the ballots containing the names of persons who have been selected to serve as grand jurors, which is called â€?the grand jury box of the county.â€?There was no grand jury box in the county of Albany, there had been no selection in such county of persons to serve as grand jurors, and there had been nothing whatever done therein for the obtainment of a grand jury which the law required. On the contrary, the provisions of a void and unconstitutional act were obeyed1 and followed. In view of these conceded facts, and the words of the section of the Code, which have been given, if the court has a discretion to set aside the panel for non-compliance completely with the provisions of law for the obtainment of grand jurors, how should that â€?discretion â€?(if it can be called by that name) be exercised, when it is conceded that no list of grand jurors has been made, that not a single ballot containing the name of a person selected according to law to serve as such,, has been placed in â€?the grand jury box of the county,â€?and consequently not one ballot drawn therefrom? This question would seem to admit of only one answer, and it is this, a wise exercise of judicial discretion requires a court, whenever it plainly appears that every safeguard of law in the selection of grand jurors has been disregarded, and new and unconstitutional methods of choice have been employed to set aside the supposed panel, and to order a new panel to be summoned in accordance with existing and unrepealed statutes. Ho other order can be made, if plain statutes are to be obeyed, and the organic law is of force.
From what has been said it is plain what judicial conclusion would have been reached, if the objections made to the composition and organization of the grand jury had been argued and pressed to a decision when made. By consent of counsel, however, the motion was not then submitted, but such omission to ask for a decision upon the objections, was with the express understanding, and stipulation on the part of the district-attorney, that if the defendants were indicted, they should be entitled to the same order to which they would have been entitled had the1 decision been made prior to the organization. . The object of that stipulation undoubtedly was to prevent the failure of the grand jury, to which many cases were to be presented against parties who had made no objection to the constitution thereof, and indictments against whom would, if found, be'valid under the decision in the Petrea case.
With some doubt as to what the order should be, the conclusion reached is, that the indictment against each of the defendants should be quashed. They have been found by a grand jury, to the organization of which valid objections were made, and which would have been sustained if they had then been pressed; and as such objections were not then determined upon the stipulation of the district-attorney, that the court could, after indictment, make such an order as it would have originally made, and as the order would have been one which would have prevented the finding of an indictment against either of the defendants by the body as subsequently organized, because such organization would not have taken place, it follows, that what was done by such body against the defendants should be set aside and held of no effect.
The conclusion just stated is also the legal one, for another reason. Objections are now made, not only after an indictment found, to the organization of the grand jury that presented it, and which should be disregarded because of the decision of the Court of Appeals in the Petrea case, but such objections preceded the organization of the body called a grand jury, and how, when then made, the case should be decided, that of Petrea does not determine. Even though the district-attorney had â€¢not stipulated that the court should decide the questions upon their merits, without regard to the fact that an indictment had been found, as-an original question, it must be held that valid objections made to a grand jury before its organization,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but then reserved and not decided, and renewed after indictment, must be held effectual to quash the indictment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is proper to say in conclusion, that the questions which have been discussed ought to be settled before the county of Albany is subjected to the expense and costs of many trials, if that be possible, and the orders to be entered will be in such shape and form, both in these cases and in several others in which Mr. Meegan and other counsel have raised the same objections, as may be necessary to review them, and to preserve the rights of the people. What should be the form of the orders is not now determined. If the orders to be made are final and incapable of review (and upon that point no opinion is expressed), whilst regretting that fact, it cannot alter the legal conclusion which, after most careful thought and study, is too clear for a single doubt. Eights guaranteed by the Constitution are too sacred to be trifled with. They cannot be brushed away by calling them â€œtechnicalities,â€?and insisting that in doing so â€?no harm has been done.â€?It is impossible to legally affirm that â€?no harm has been done,â€?when something guaranteed by law has been refused, for it is a proposition, as old as the law, that every violation of constitutional right in a criminal case is, of itself, conclusive evidence that substantial injury has been un-ought. It is impossible to judicially know of the criminal guilt of an individual, except by and through legal and constitutional methods of procedure, because until the ascertainment of the contrary by such methods, the presumption of innocence is the shield of every man against punishment. Courts should be zealous to uphold, and not ingenious to get around or over constitutional enactments; and to no class of such enactments is this remark more applicable than to those which are designed to secure proper and impartial jurors, both grand and petit. If the judges of England had been subtle in thÃ©ir endeavors to take away such constitutional protections from the accused, then the learned Blackstoue could not have effectively answered Montesquieuâ€™s assertion â€?that because Rome, Sparta and Carthage had lost their liberties, therefore, those of England must, in time, perish,â€?by the argument he uses in his Commentaries (book 3, page 397), that Montesquieu â€œshould have recollected, that Rome, Sparta and Carthage at the time that their liberties were lost, were strangers to the trial by jury.â€?In making that answer, a profound truth was uttered, but such answer can only be true, where judges carefully preserve every safeguard of jury trials. The presentment and trial by jury are the boast and pride of America as they are of England. They should be most carefully and sedulously guarded, and the labor in preparing this opinion, as well as that in the Petrea case, will be amply rewarded if either or both shall contribute a mite to uphold and protect the guaranties which the Constitution gives to every citizen for his protection, without regard to his antecedents, or to the misfortunes which surround him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1164436,PEOPLE v. HOVEY,1883-07,"By the Court.â€”Davis, P. J.
The court have given to the case on this appeal, and to the motion to dismiss the appeal their careful consideration, and have reached conclusions that will now be indicated.
As to the appealability of the order a majority of the court are of opinion that no appeal lies in such a case. Section 517 of the Code of Criminal Procedure declares in what cases appeals may be taken by the defendant in criminal cases. It is-in these words: â€?An appeal to the Supreme Court may be taken by the defendant from the judgment on a conviction after indictment, and upon the appeal, any actual decision of the court in an intermediate order or proceeding forming a part of the judgment roll as prescribed by section 485 may be reviewed.â€?Section 485 makes provision for the inclusion in the judgment roll which may be brought up by the appeal under section 517, of â€?a copy of the minutes of any proceedings upon a motion either for a â€?new trial or in arrest of judgment.â€?. Provision is therefore made for the revision of motions of this character when they are embraced in the judgment roll as provided Vy section 485. But we look in vain in the act for any provision for an appeal on a motion for a new trial in any case except in the case and form presented by section 517. At common law no appeals could be brought from judgment orders or interlocutory proceedings in criminal cases. The right of appeal in such oases is purely statutory; but in cases where there is no statutory provision, the right of appeal does not exist. The code has made no statutory provision for an appeal from an order denying a motion for a new trial in any case where the motion is made after final judgment in the action, unless the findings and order be embodied in the judgment roll. It has, however, by. the provisions of the act of 1882, now section 517 of the Code, granted to the convicted party an opportunity to make a motion in the trial court in capital cases, or when the application cannot be made to the trial court prior to the execution of the sentence, by application to a justice of the Supremo Court or a Special Term thereof. But while it has given this new privilege to a party convicted of a capital crime, where sentence of death has been pronounced, the legislature has not seen, fit to superadd the right of appeal by any statutory provision. It has only granted an additional privilege to the convicted party which terminated with the application to the court or judge before whom the motion is made. A majority of the court have come to the conclusion that this is the correct view of the statutory provisions and of the law in respect of the right of appeal in such cases.
But notwithstanding the views of the majority of the court, and especially because one of the judges entertains a different opinion, and because the case is a capital one, involving the life of the defendant, we have concluded that it is our better course to consider the appeal and dispose of it on its merits without finally determining the question whether or not^ an appeal li.es.
The provision of the act of 1882 (now section 466 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) allows in capital cases at any time before the sentence is executed, an application to be made to the court before which the trial was had, or if that court be not in session, to any justice of the Supreme Court or any Special Term thereof for a new trial upon several grounds. These grounds are enumerated by section 465. They are seven in number, upon all or either of which a motion of this character can be made under section 466. But when the motion is founded upon the seventh subdivision of section 465 the Code expressly prescribes what must appear as sufficient grounds for granting a new trial.
That section is in these words : â€?When it is made to appear by affidavit that upon another trial the defendant can produce evidence such as if received would probably have changed the verdict, if such evidence has been discovered since the trial, is not cumulative, and the failure to produce which on the trial was not owing to want of diligence.â€?On such a motion the court or judge is to act not only upon the affidavit presented, but also of course upon the testimony and proceedings had and taken upon the trial at which the conviction occurred; and it must be considered whether the evidence claimed to be newly discovered if it had been given upon the former trial would probably have changed the verdict.
How if we take the case the prisoner made for himself and assume that his testimony would have been the same if this new evidence had also been produced, we can hardly conceive it possible for the jury to have rendered any other verdict, because liis own evidence and the manner in which he detailed the act which constituted the homicide and the manner in which he states what he did on that day and what he said, and the effect of his version of the transaction, would be in direct conflict with all that is sought to be added upon the new trial. If the new evidence had been given in the case, the jury would have been driven to the necessity of rejecting his own account of the affair in order to give him the benefit of the new evidence now sought to be introduced.- So that we are not able to come to any conclusion different from that reached by the justice at Special Term upon the question whether it would probably have changed the verdict.
But if we had reached a different conclusion we must then be satisfied that the evidence has been discovered since the trial within the meaning of the law. That it existed before the trial is indisputable. Has it been discovered since the trial within the meaning of the law ?
We must assume that the prisoner, on the former trial, knew that he had been arrested ten days previous to the commission of the crime in a state of intoxication, had been in prison three days and subject to the close confinement described in the affidavit by reason of his conduct, although he may not have known the exact condition physically and mentally in which he then was. All that preceded the crime, therefore, in respect of his condition, so far as relates to the intoxication and the arrest and imprisonment for intoxication, were known to the prisoner. If it was known to him before the trial, it cannot properly be called newly discovered evidence. It was a fact, which it was his duty, if he regarded it as important, to have made known to his counsel and to have had it brought to the attention of the court by summoning witnesses.
What occurred after the commission of the crime and his arrest as detailed by the affidavit of the prison doctor is also not newly discovered. It is not the development of some unknown fact, but of facts which had previously existed, and must well have been known to the accused. If he were under the treatment of the medical man who makes the affidavit is there any question blit that that fact was within his knowledge ? The only thing newly discovered is the fact that it might have been of some importance to himself if it had been produced. That is not what the law contemplated when a party seeks a new trial upon this ground.
But again, it must appear not to be cumulative. The fact that it is not cumulative must be shown affirmatively. In this case it appeared by the testimony of several of the witnesses, and to some extent by the testimony of the defendant himself, that he had been drinking for some days'before the commission of the crime, and that he was intoxicated at the time of its commission. The subject therefore of'his condition by reason of the use of intoxicating drinks was one circumstance presented by the testimony for the consideration of the jury. It would be cumulative evidence in the meaning of the law to give additional proof of his intoxication and of its effect prior to the commission of the crime, by producing the witnesses who could testify to those facts. There is, therefore, no doubt that the learned court was correct in holding that if this evidence was produced it would be cumulative in.its character. We do not lose sight of the fact insisted upon by the learned counsel that the evidence goes so far as not merely to show habits of intoxication, but also that the prisoner had by the use of sedatives as well as of intoxicating liquors produced a diseased condition of the mind which he was incapable of controlling. That evidence, however, would of necessity, have been required to be sufficient to convince the jury that his mind was in such a condition as to be incapable of forming a deliberation and premeditation required to constitute murder in the first degree. But evidence upon that question was of necessity before the jury. The whole case, as a matter of course, involved the condition and mental operations of the accused party at the time of the commission of the crime, In such cases that question is one of primary importance. If, therefore, any evidence is produced on the trial to establish that the mental condition of the party was such that he did not or could not form the deliberation required by the statute, all that has a tendency to make that more potent in its influence on the minds of the jury is cumulative. So ihat if any accused party relies for the purpose of proving the' character of the crime, upon the condition of his mind at the time of doing the act, he must proceed to establish that condition by the production of all evidence bearing upon that question, within his knowledge or which he could have procured by proper diligence. In this case the prisoner went into that evidence to a certain extent. He brought before the jury the proof of the fact that he had been drinking and was intoxicated to some degree on that morning ; and accompanied that evidence with his statement, clear, coherent, and as it appears from the record if credited by the jury, justifying a verdict of minor character, because of the alleged accidental nature of the act which caused the death. All the evidence that is offered here relative to his condition is in our opinion cumulative within the sense of the law.
In addition, however, to the things already noticed, the section requires it to appear that the failure to produce it on the trial was not owing to want of diligence.
It is perfectly obvious, as we think, that the failure to produce this evidence upon the trial was owing to want of diligence. We do not mean to impute wnnt of diligence in any sense of neglect of duty, to the counsel employed. They have at no time been lacking in diligence in doing their whole duty toward this prisoner, and the motion now pending is in itself strong evidence not only of diligence but of extreme diligence in favor of this unhappy man. But what the law means by lack of diligence is the omission on the part of the accused to disclose the facts to his counsel, so as to enable him to judge whether matters of any kind are within his knowledge would be important to him on the trial. Diligence on his part would have disclosed the fact of his arrest ten days before for intoxication, his confinement in prison and the treatment he was subjected to, and that that indicated the condition of mind as now claimed.
So also, as it seems to us, very slight diligence on his part would have disclosed his illness in, prison and the attendance he received from the doctor; and a single question to the doctor would have developed the facts as to the condition of the prisonerâ€™s mind for a week previous to the commission of the crime, judging by his condition as the doctorâ€™s affidavit states it, several days after his imprisonment for the crime.
On none of these several requirements of the seventh subdivision of section 455 of the Code does the affidavit come up to what the law demands.
The result is that this court is of opinion on the merits that the decision of Mr. Justice Donohue at Special Term was in all respects entirely correct ; and that it is our duty to affirm the order without dismissing the appeal because the order was not appealable as we might do under the opinion of the majority of the court.
The order of the Special Term must therefore be affirmed.

1164489,PEOPLE v. WILLIAMS,1883-04,"Hardin, J.
[After stating facts as above.]â€”It is now provided by statute that the testimony of an accomplice is not sufficient to warrant a jury in convicting an accused person of a crime. By chapter 360, of the Laws of 1882, section 399 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was amended so as to read as follows : â€?Section 399. A conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless he be corroborated by such other evidence as tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime.â€?Prior to this statute a jury might convict upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice although courts were required, and it was their duty, to caution juries against rendering a verdict upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice; and juries were advised not to convict on such testimony in the absence of confirmation of the material facts thereof by other evidence. People v. Costello, 1 Den. 83 ; People v. Dyle, 21 N. Y. 578; Dunn v. People, 29 Id. 523; Lindsay v. People, 63 Id. 154.
In the case in hand we have.found in the appeal book no direct and positive testimony, aside from that given by the accomplice, which connects the accused with the crime charged in the indictment; but many circumstances and some admissions and declarations of the accused, when considered in connection with the positive testimony of the accomplice tending to implicate the accused in the commission of the offense. In the circumstantial evidence relied upon by the people to implicate the accused and corroborate the accomplice, is the testimony given for the purpose of establishing that William Oortright was seen at the time and place narrated, by Martin Teeter. It appears by this witnessâ€?evidence that he said, viz.: â€?I cannot swear that this man was Oortright â€?whom he met. â€?I donâ€™t know whether it was he or not.â€?When the witness , was asked if - he had an impression who it was, the defendantâ€™s counsel objected' to it as incompetent. The objection was overruled, and the defendant excepted. The witness was permitted to answer, viz.: â€? donâ€™t know for certain, only whom I thought it was; I thought it was William Oortright, but I donâ€™t know. I had known him for a number of years and seen him frequently.â€?After this ruling, the district attorney propounded the following question, viz.: â€?It was your impression at the time % â€?and the witness answered â€?Yes. sir.â€?Following ' O this answer, the appeal book shows that the defendant asked to have the testimony of this â€?witness about passing this man stricken out; â€?and that the court refused and the defendant took an exception. In these several rulings occurring in the testimony of this witness Teeter, we think there was error. First, it expressly appears by the testimony that the witness was not able to identify positively or upon knowledge the person lie met as that of William Cortright. The most that he could say was that he had an impression who it was, and that he â€?thought it was William Cortright.â€?We are of the opinion that such impression and such â€?thought â€?of the witness ought not to have been received, or, having been received, ought to. have been stricken out upon defendantâ€™s motion. People v. Wilson, 3 Parker Crim.. 206. Strong, J., says, in the case last cited, â€?Ordinarily the question of identity is one of fact, and a witness may be asked whether he knows a pai-ticular individual, and if so whether he is the person indicated. But the question put to this witness is not the ordinary one of identity. It calls for an opinion relative to a body which, if that of the deceased, had been submerged in salt water for upward of five months, and had undergone many changes. The witness can only state a conclusion drawn from the points of resemblance mentioned by him. The jury have heard his statements, and it is for .them, and not the witness to decide whether the body was that of the deceased captain.. The question must be rejected.â€?Again, if a witness could be allowed to testify to an impression to a â€?thought at the time,â€?it would be difficult to predicate and establish perjury in respect to such answers.
We are of the opinion that the usual course upon trials is to require the witness to state knowledge, recollection or memory of facts in respect to the identity of individuals, and not to allow them in the first instance, as evidence in chief, to state â€œimpressionsâ€?or â€œthoughtsâ€?in respect to the identity of individuals. It appears to us the rule was departed from in receiving and retaining the testimony of the witness, Teeter. We cannot say -this erroneous evidence was not prejudieal to the rights of the accused. We are not able to say that it had no influence in producing the verdict rendered against the accused; nor can we say that â€?if his evidence was struck from the case the proof of defendantâ€™s guilt would be clear and overwhelmingand we can say therefore, that the rule, found in the Gonzalez case, is not applicable. People v. Gonzalez, 35 N. Y. 58.
Second : As amended by chapter 360 of the Laws of 1882, section 5,27 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides, viz.: â€?.. and the appellate court may order a new trial if it be satisfied that the verdict against the prisoner was (1) against the weight of evidence, or (2) against law, or (3) that justice required a new trial, whether any exception shall have been taken or not in the court below.â€?This is the first capital case which this court has been called upon to review under the provision of the section just quoted. Our impression is that it was the design of the legislature by this provision of law to allow the appellate court to order a new trial, if in any aspect of the ease error was committed in the progress of tlie trial, and that the narrow and technical rules in respect to the exactitude of exceptions was abrogated in respect to this class of cases. We must, therefore, look into the proceedings upon the trial to discover whether any error has occurred, and if such error is found we must declare the error, and allow it to produce a new trial â€?whether any exception shall have been taken or not in the court belowâ€?sufficient to formally and directly raise the question of alleged error or not under the previous strict and technical rules.
With this new statutory provision in mind, we turn to the charge of the learned judge in the case before us, and find that in laying down the rule under section 399 (supra), he stated the"" law correctly in the body of his charge in two or three instances, which are pertinent to the question whether he properly refused to yield at. the close of his charge to a request which was made of him. In the body of his charge he said, viz., 1st. â€?If there is any evidence tending to show that Cortright was connected with the crime, yon are not to take it as against the defendant unless the evidence shows that the defendant was also connected with it.â€?2nd. â€?The law now provides that the corroboration must connect the defendant with the commission of the crime. In this case it must be corroborated by testimony tending to show that Sam Williams was the person who perpetrated the crime.â€?...
3d. â€?The evidence must also tend to show that Williams was there, and to fix upon him the guilt of the crime there must be some evidence outside of the story of Â¡Newport which will enable yon to say that Williams was with Â¡Newport at the time the crime was committed. That evidence the people have sought to give.â€?,
4th. â€?The corroborating evidence must be such as tends, outside of the testimony of Newport, to point to the defendant.â€?Notwithstanding these statements, which appeal1 in the body of the charge, the appeal book shows that the prisonerâ€™s counsel made a request of the court, viz., â€?to charge the jury that there must be evidence tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the office; that this requires more than such evidence as merely raised a suspicion of guilt,â€?thereupon the court refused, except as charged, and an exception was taken to such refusal. If this request was being considered under the rule, which obtained before that laid down in section 527 (supra) perhaps it would be a good answer to say that the request was too broad; that it called upon the court to repeat what had already been stated, as we have seen, in the questions we have made in the body of the charge.
But under the more liberal rule given to us by section 527 to which we have alluded, we are of opinion that the court erroneously refused to yield to that portion of the request which called upon it to say that the rule enacted in section 399 required more than such evidence as merely raised the suspicion of guilt. The court might in response to that part of the request well and properly have said, that the rule described in section 399 required that the testimony of the accomplice should be corroborated in'material points; and secondly, that it should be corroborated in respect to such matters as legitimately tended to establish that the accused was connected with the crime, and that in establishing such connection with the crime, it was incumbent upon the people to give such evidence as legitimately and naturally carried conviction to the minds of the jury, that the accused was connected with and was guilty of the offence charged ; and that such evidence â€?as merely raised the suspicion of guilt â€?was insufficient to satisfy the requirements laid down in section 399. There is a wide difference between evidence which tends to satisfy an intelligent jury that the accused has perpetrated a crime and such evidence as merely tends to raise in the mind of the jury â€?a suspicion of guilt.â€?""We are of the opinion that such instructions as were requested ought to have been given by the learned trial judge to the jury in this case. We must therefore say that justice requires a new trial, and that it is not material to determine that the exception taken is technically well founded under the practice which obtained prior to the amendment of 1882, of section 527 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
As the views already expressed lead us to order a new trial, we do not deem it necessary or useful to examine the numerous other grounds urged upon us in the argument of the counsel for the appellant.
Judgment and conviction reversed and new trial ordered in the Oyer and Terminer of Wayne county, to which court these proceedings are remitted, with directions to proceed.

1164475,PEOPLE ex rel. LUMBARD v. WARDEN OF AUBURN STATE PRISON,1883-02,"Merwin, J.
From evidence outside of the record it appears that one of the justices of sessions, Mr. Weaver, was a justice of the city of Borne, elected in pursuance of chapter 25 of the Laws of 1870, entitled, â€?An Act to Incorporate the City of Borne.â€?It is claimed, on the part of the petitioner, that Mr. Weaver was not eligible to the position of justice of sessions; that therefore, his designation as such was not legal, and that the Court of Sessions, of which he was a member, was, therefore, not a competent tribunal. Hence the main question on the merits is whether a justice of the peace elected under the charter of the city of Borne is eligible to the position of justice of sessions. In the Constitution of the state as amended in 1869 (article 6, section 15), it is provided that Courts of Sessions may be held by â€?the county judge, with two justices of the peace to be designated according to law.â€?Under this provision and the statute passed in conformity therewith, justices of sessions are elected. There is no constitutional qualification for such justices of the peace. By the same article of the Constitution (section 8), it is provided that the electors of the several towns shall, at their annual town meeting, and in such manner as the legislature may direct, elect justices of the peace, whose term of office shall be four years. The same section provides that justices of the peace shall be elected in the different cities of this State in such manner and with such powers and for such terms as shall be prescribed by law. So that justices of the peace of towns and justices of the peace for cities are both recognized by the Constitution, and each class, for aught that appears in the Constitution, are eligible for the position of justice of sessions. Bo distinction is made between them. We have no right to say that only town justices are eligible. Their eligibility does not depend upon the amount of criminal jurisdiction they may individually have. They do not carry their individual criminal jurisdiction in the Court of Sessions. The , jurisdiction of that court does not depend upon the jurisdiction of the component party, but upon the statute, which, in pursuance of the authority given by the Constitution, prescribes what the jurisdiction of the court shall be. I find, therefore, no reason in the Constitution why a city justice of the peace, elected in pursuance of law, specially authorized by the Constitution, is not eligible to be designated as justice of sessions.
The city of Rome was incorporated by chapter 25 of the Laws of 1870. The boundaries were the same as the town of Rome. Four justices of the peace were provided for, who should have and exercise all the powers, authority and jurisdiction, and discharge all the duties of justices of the peace of the several towns of the State, except as modified by the act; and it was provided that all laws applicable to the justices of the peace of the several towns and to their official acts, duties and powers, should apply to the justices of the peace of said city to their official acts, duties and powers. The act gave to the recorder, except in case of absence or inability, sole-and executive jurisdiction in said city, of all criminal matters, ordinarily cognizable by justices of the peace in towns. In case of the absence or inability of the recorder, either justice of the peace could act in his place, so that each justice had full criminal jurisdiction in certain contingencies. Aside from this limitation the justices had full power and authority of justices in towns, and this limitation did not, in terms or in reason, or by any fair implication, have anything to do with their right to be designated as justices of sessions.
With regard to one of these very justices, the General Term in this department, in the decision of the cÃ¡se of Haley v. Connell, say: â€œWe are of opinion that he was a duly elected justice of the peace, and had all the powers of a justice of the peace of a town.â€?Host of the decisions referred to by the counsel had reference to the constitution before 1869, which had no provision specially authorizing the election of justices of the peace in cities. In the case of Geraty v. Reed (78 N. Y. 64), the efiect of the amendment of 1869 was not considered.
In People ex rel. White v. City of Rochester (11 Hun, 241), the question was whether courts held by justices of the peace in the city of Rochester, elected under an act passed in z. 1861, were inferior local courts within the meaning of the Constitution, and therefore be liable to be abolished by the Legislature, and it was held that they were.
In Wenzler v. People (58 N. Y. 516), on the question whether police justices in Hew York city could be deemed to be either justices of the peace or district court justices, as named in the Constitution, it was held that they could not be, and Judge Johnson, in giving the prevailing opinion, argued that the title justice of the peace, as used in the Constitution, was not descriptive of function, but the name of a particular office. Judge Allen, giving the dissenting opinion, argued to the contrary. It does not seem to me important to refer to the other cases cited by counsel on this question. They do not, as I regard them, give us any light. The point, as I regard it, is just this: The Constitution provides for the election of two classes of justices of the peace. It also provides for another position that may be filled by any justice of the peace. That means that any justice of either class may fill it. Under the statute providing for the manner of designation of justice of sessions (L. 1847, ch. 280, Â§ 40, ch. 470, Â§ 34), any justice of the peace in the county having the required length of time to serve, may be named. It is my opinion, therefore, that a justice of the peace in the city of Borne is eligible. Having reached this conclusion it is not important to consider the other questions raised.
It follows that the proceedings must be dismissed.
The General Term affirmed the above decision by default, April, 1883.
Hote.â€”See Ostrander v. People, ante, 274. The case of Haley v. Connell, referred to in Judge Merwinâ€™s opinion, has not been reported in full.

1164438,PEOPLE v. WEED,1883-05,"Barnard, P. J.
The prisoner was indicted for bigamy. The offense was clearly proven. The prisoner married one Louisa Bryson, in Westchester county, in this state, in 1875, and he again married one Carrie Megol, in May, 1881, in Westchester county. Louisa Bryson was at the date of the second marriage, and is yet living. It was proven upon the trial that before the second marriage the prisoner and his wife signed articles under seal, in Connecticut, that if either party should' apply for a divorce the other would not oppose the application, and would not appear against' the petitioning party.
A question was put by the prisonerâ€™s counsel to him whether the justice of the peace in Connecticut who witnessed the paper did not not tell him that the paper was.in legal effect a divorce. The same question Vas put to another witness to the paper. These questions were overruled and an exception taken to the decision. This presents the only question in the case. We think it was not an erroneous ruling. The general rule is that all are presumed to know the law, and that ignorance of the law excuses no one from crime.
The particular crime alleged was fully made out. The two marriages were understandingly entered into by the prisoner, with full knowledge of the facts which by statute establishes the offense. The prisoner when he married the second time knew that his first wife was still living. M either the deputy sheriff who drew the papers nor the justice who read it over could destroy the effect of an intentional violation of a statute by advice that such violation could be lawfully done. ""
The conviction should, therefore, be affirmed.

1164439,MULLALLY v. PEOPLE,1881-03,"Daniels, J.
The only exception required to be reviewed for the purpose of disposing of this case, is, that taken to the refusal of the Court to direct the jury to find a verdict of not guilty, for the reason that a dog was not the subject of larceny. It was proved that the dog wore a collar at the time when he was taken, and the indictment charged that to be of the value of ten dollars ; but as no actual value was given in the evidence to the collar, it is doubtful whether the jury would, in that state of the proof, be justified in finding it to have been valuable, and for that reason the subject of larceny. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the other point presented, whether the dog himself was property of such a nature as to be capable of being the subject of larceny. At the common law the rule was established that the crime of larceny could not be committed by feloniously taking and carrying away a dog. Wharton Crim. Raw, 4 ed. Â§ 1775. This rule was followed in the ease of Ward v. State, 48 Ala. 161; and other cases have arisen in which it has been applied in the same manner.
All the cases, however, concede that a dog is property, and its owner is entitled to redress by way of a civil action against any person injuring or unlawfully taking it. But by the common law it was deemed to be property of such an inferior nature that it could be taken without committing the crime of larceny.
This was a valuable dog, worth a sum not exceeding that of Â§25. And the statute of this state has provided that a person .who shall be convicted of stealing, taking and carrying away the personal property of another, of the value of Â§25 or less-shall be adjudged guilty of petit larceny. 3 R. S. 6 ed. 969, Â§ 1.. This provision is so general in its term as to indicate it to have' been the intention of the Legislature to include within it all such articles as, in any just and proper sense, may be characterized as personal property. But in the revision which was made, containing this provision, that was not left to be determined as a mere matter of inference, for care was taken to define the phrase â€?personal property,â€?and as so defined it was declared to-mean goods, chattels, effects, evidences of rights in action, and written instruments by which any pecuniary obligation, or any rights or title to property, real or personal, shall be created, acknowledged, transferred, increased, defeated, discharged or diminished (Id. 995, Â§ 55). This enlargement of the meaning of the phrase included it as it had been used in the portion of the statute declaring what should be the subject of larceny.
And it was referred to in the notes of the revisers in such terms as to indicate the intention to be to comprehend within the phrase all such articles as would ordinarily be understood to come within the fair definition of personal property. Upon this subject, in referring to the general provision so made, it was stated that this broad and comprehensive definition was given to prevent the enumeration of each particular instrument or article that might be the subject of larceny, robbery, embezzlement, or obtaining property under false pretenses, and that anything that can be stolen, and which is of value to the owner, should be protected by the law. 5 N. Y. Stat. at L. 562, Â§ 32. When this revision was made, dogs were legally defined as chattels, as well as property, as of value to their owners and for the purposes of private redress, within the protection of the law, as it had before then been declared. At the time when the common law relating to larceny was settled, the severity of' its punishment induced the courts to decline to apply it to the taking of property ""of this description. But with the modification in that respect which has since been made, the reason upon which the exception was based has ceased to exist. That was the case at the time when these statutory provisions were made, and there was then no just grounds for continuing to discriminate against this class of property. The dog had been and. was not only the servant, but, to some extent, the companion of his master, participating in his pastimes and sport, and protecting his property; and he was, and he still is, the only one of the brutes which will forsake his own species, and in his friendly attachments, follow his owner through all vicissitudes and dangers, and act as the ever faithful sentinel of his interests. He was, as he is now, a marketable commodity, and as larceny has been so much mitigated in its punishment, no good reason exists for allowing the act of stealing him to be made an exception to the very general provision contained in this statute. An act in similar terms, as to the nature of the property designed to be protected, was made a law in the state of Hew Hampshire. Its design was to provide for the punishment of the willful and malicious injury or destruction of personal property, and in the case of State v. McDuffy, 34 N. H. 523, the point was presented whether a dog was in protection of the provision, and it was held by the court that he was, and consequently it was an offense maliciously to destroy or injure him.
This is a direct authority, supporting the construction given to the provisions of the statutes of this state, which have â€¢already been mentioned.
A similar point was presented in the case of the People v. Malloney (1 Park. Crim. 593), and also in that of the People v. Campbell (4 Id. 386). In the latter case the authorities were well considered by Bussell, City Judge, and in both it was held, that as the statutory law existed in this state, the crime of larceny might be committed by feloniously taking and carrying away a dog. Upon this subject the Legislature have not seen fit to adopt the excejffion existing under the common law, but the law defining the crime has been framed in such terms as to include whatever may properly be designated as personal property. All the authorities concede dogs to be property of that description, and as the reason for the old rule of the common law disappeared many years before the enactment of these provisions, it was no longer required to be maintained or perpetuated in this state.
The intention of the Legislature may well be presumed to be opposed to its continuance, and to require the enactments made upon this subject-to be so applied, as to protect all descriptions of personal property against felonious appropriation by the act of others. The case was clearly made out against the prisoner, and literally his act was a crime under the laws of the state. Although they may have created a change in this respect, it was a wholesome and proper one to be made, and no strained construction should be adopted for the purpose of defeating what may fairly be inferred to have been the design and intention of the law.
The prisoner was properly convicted, and the judgment should be affirmed.

Note.â€”In affirming this decision (86 N.

1164495,PEOPLE v. WILLETT,1883-03,"â€?Miller, J.â€”This
This case arises upon a writ of error, on behalf of the people, to review the judgment of the general term of the supreme court reversing judgment of conviction of defendant on an indictment for murder in the first degree.
Upon the examination before the coroner a witness, Mrs. Wing, was sworn, who identified the defendant as- the person whom she had seen at her house on the night of the murder, a few miles from the place where the crime was committed, and with whom she had some conversation. Experiments were made before the coroner for the purpose of testing .the recollection of Mrs. Wing. The defendant and others were placed around the room'and witness was asked to pick out the person, she saw at her house that night, and she designated the defendant. The same persons were made to pass behind her, each repeating the words, as to asking for a dr.ink of water, which as she testified had been used at her house on the night of the murder, and she was asked to detect by the voice the one who had used the same language at her house on the night in question, and she recognized the defendantâ€™s voice as belonging to such person. The defendant did not deny, in answer to either test, that he was the person Mrs. Wing saw that night.
These experiments were admitted as evidence upon the trials on the ground that the silence of the defendant was an admission of his guilt. The evidence was objected to and the objection overruled. It is claimed that the ruling of the court, in this respect, was erroneous. The same question was raised by the defendantâ€™s counsel on motion to strike out the evidence which was denied and an exception duly taken. Also by a request to the court to charge the jury to disregard it, which was refused and an exception taken. The question whether the defendant was bound to speak, and understood that he was at liberty to speak if he chose, was submitted to the jury by the court in his charge, and an exception taken thereto. The doctrine as to silence being taken as an implied admission of the truth of allegations spoken or uttered in the presence of a person, does not apply to silence at a judicial proceeding or hearing. And if the proceedings before the coroner were of a judicial character, the evidence was erroneously received. It is very apparent that the examination before the coroner partook of a judicial character and what there transpired must be considered as a part of the proceedings; the coroner was there, a jury had been etnpanneled and witnesses were examined whose testimony was returned as a portion of the coronerâ€™s proceedings. It is difficult to see upon what ground it can be claimed that the experiments which were made were not in connection with the proceedings before the coroner and a part thereof. The claim that they were informal and outside of the proceedings is not well founded, and it would be extremely difficult to draw the line between the other proceedings and these which are said to have been outside of them. We think the submission of the question to the jury, whether it was a judicial proceeding, was erroneous; the court should have held whether the proceedings before the coroner were judicial or otherwise, thus giving to the defendantâ€™s counsel the benefit of an exception.if he chose to take one. The evidence in regard to the coronerâ€™s proceedings was before the court; and it should have determined whether the facts referred to constituted a part of these proceedings, and it cannot, we think, be said that it was proper to leave the same to the jury for the reason that it could have done no harm. It is very evident these experiments were made with a view of sustaining the correctness of Mrs. Wingâ€™s testimony, and hence they constituted a part of the proceedings before the coroner. The evidence of Mrs. Wing was for the purpose of showing circumstances tending to prove that the defendant was in the vicinity at the time of the commission of the crime and his silence might be taken as assenting to that fact. The fact that he thus remained silent and did not deny that he was present at the time stated by Mrs. Wing might well have affected the minds of the jurors.
Under the circumstances presented, the proceedings before the coroner were clearly of a judicial character and the defendant was not bound to speak,â€”his silence could not be regarded as an evidence of guilt.
There are other questions in the case, but inasmuch as they may not arise upon another trial, we do not deem it necessary to consider them.
The judgment of-the General Term should be affirmed.

1164479,PEOPLE v. SCHEWE,1883-01,"Hardin, J.
In Rau v. People (63 N. Y. 279) the Court of Appeals said: â€?Hitherto the courts have not been willing to take notice that lager-beer is intoxicating, but have submitted the question to the jury to be determined upon the evidence. The plain and obvious intention of the section is to prohibit the sale of all intoxicating liquors; and where the liquors are not such as are known to the courts to be intoxicating, their character as intoxicating or not must be determined, as it was in this case, upon competent evidence as a question of fact.â€?Following the rule we have quoted the Court of Sessions in this case received evidence tending to show that lager-beer is intoxicating, and evidence tending to show that the lager-beer sold by the defendant was not intoxicating and then carefully and fully submitted the question of fact to the jury, and they have found against the defendant, and after reading the evidence in the appeal book we feel prepared to say the evidence fairly warranted the verdict. We agree with Wells, J., when he says in Commissioners of Excise v. Taylor (21 N. Y. 178) that but one safe and sensible line of distinction can be drawn between the different kinds of liquor containing alcohol in order to determine upon which of them- the statute was intended to operate, and that is between those which are capable of causing intoxication and those containing so small a percentage of alcohol that the human stomach cannot contain sufficient of the liquor to produce that effect.â€?Of course we are not unmindful of the fact that different liquors and different quantities will produce different effects, upon different persons, and that the effect upon persons may depend upon their habits, their health, their age and constitutions.
In the case before us the trial court had all these considerations before it and many others, and was called upon to submit, as it properly did, the case to the jury.
Hull, as a witness called for the people, and who said he had drank lager-beer at different times in the defendantâ€™s garden adjoining defendantâ€™s house, â€?was asked if he had ever seen persons intoxicated on lager,â€?and the defendant made a general objection thereto which was overruled by the court.
It is now urged that the inquiry ought to have been confined to the beer sold by the defendant. If the trial court had been asked to thus confine the inquiry we cannot say that it would not have complied, and we can say that the point now taken should have been raised at the' trial. Salisbury v. Howe, 87 N. Y 134. Nor was it error to allow Dr. Hamlin to give an answer to the question, viz.: â€?In your opinion can the human stomach contain enough of beer containing 2TW per cent, of alcohol by weight to ordinarily or commonly intoxicate?â€?The objection was general, and the evidence tended to support the issue. The case of Manke v. People (17 Hun, 414) is distinguishable, for there the question was objected to upon the ground â€?that the opinion of the witness was incompetent and improper and on the ground that the subject was not one of science or skill.â€?Nor was it error to exclude the offer to show by witness Gardner, a revenue officer, â€?that he told all applicants that they should pay $25 and that it was the universal practice to take the $25 license instead of the $20 one.â€?It was too broad. It was immaterial what the revenue officers told other applicants, and it was immaterial what the universal practice was in that regard; nor was the custom for parties who only sell ale and beer to obtain the $25 license pertinent or useful evidence. It was properly excluded. Bellinger v. Gray, 51 N. Y. 610. '
A violation of a statutq cannot be justified by custom. Fellows v. Mayor, 8 Hun, 484.
Defendant was sworn in liis own behalf and gave evidence material to the issue, and in the course of his cross-examination he was asked if his license had been taken away, and he replied it had, and he was then asked : â€?Upon what charge the license had been taken away ? â€?to which question an objection and exception were taken. The witness answered, â€?For violation of the excise law;â€?and he was then asked â€˜â€?Wasnâ€™t the charge for selling on Sunday ? â€?To which the defendantâ€™s counsel objected and excepted, and the witness answered, â€?I think it was. It was two years ago, I think.â€?A revocation of a license is provided by section 4 of chapter 549 of the Laws of 1873, and the proceedings for such revocation are in the nature of a trial (People ex rel. Beller v. Wright, 3 Hun, 306), and the accused is entitled to notice. The question was proper in a cross-examination. People v. Crapo, 76 N. Y. 288 ; Grow v. Garlock, 15 Week. Dig. 259; Code Civ. Pro. Â§ 832, and amendment of 1879.
The defendant, after the court had charged the jury, made several requests, and it is now urged that error was committed in refusing the fourth, fifth and sixth requests. They were as follows:
â€?Fourth. There is no proof in the case that any lager-beer containing two and eleven hundredths per cent, of alcohol is intoxicating, except the opinion of Dr. Hamlin, and there is no proof that any lager-beer containing a less percentage of alcohol than two and eleven hundredths is intoxicating. The evidence all agrees that a beer containing but one-half per cent, of alcohol is not intoxicating.â€?â€?I decline to charge you that, gentlemen. I leave you entirely by the evidence to say whether the beer sold by the defendant was an intoxicating liquor.â€?â€?Fifth. There is no direct proof as to the amount of alcohol contained in the beer sold by defendant.â€?â€?I decline to charge you that.â€?â€?Sixth. If you find that the analysis of Koenigâ€™s beer, made-by Professor Towler in November, was a fair test of that beer, and you are not satisfied from the proof that defendant sold any different beer, you must acquit him.â€?â€œI decline to charge you that.â€?â–?First. We think all the questions of fact involved in the requests were fully left to the jury. Second. The defendant was not entitled to have the court say â€?there was no proof as to the amount of alcohol contained in the beer sold by the defendant, as there was no evidence from which the jury were authorized to ascertain the quantity.â€?See evidence of Dr. Hamlin and of Professor Towler. The court had submitted already the question involved in the sixth request, and it was not error to decline to repeat the charge. As a whole the charge presented the questions to the jury clearly and fully, and called upon the jury to resolve the disputed questions of fact, and their verdict seems to accord with the weight of the evidence. The defendant has not called cur attention to any other alleged errors in the course of the trial, and we find nothing in the appeal book which requires us to disturb the verdict and judgment.

The indictment accused Thomas McDonnell of the crime of murder. He pleaded â€?guilty of manslaughter in the first degree,â€?and after sentence by the General Sessions and judgment thereon, appealed to the Supreme Court, where the judgment was affirmed.
In this conclusion we find no error. The indictment charges the commission of the offense under circumstances constituting its highest degree. Upon trial he might have been convicted of a lower degree (2 R. S. 702, Â§ 27; Keefe v. People, 40 N. Y. 348), and in that case could not again be tried nor convicted of a different degree thereof. 2 R. 8. 702, Â§ 28. The same result follows a plea of guilty. It was not necessary to aver in the indictment the facts or circumstances which, if proven, would constitute the lesser crime.
These are matters of evidence for the benefit of the accused.
People v. Butler (3 Park. 377), cited by the appellant, is not to the contrary, but recognizes the rule that an indictment under the common law form is sufficient notwithstanding the statute, and permits a conviction for the offense charged in any degree according to the evidence. Nor do the cases referred to by his counsel support his contention.
The judgment should be affirmed.

Under chapter 19 of the Laws of 1875 the plaintiff in error was indicted, tried and found guilty. That statute is entitled, â€?An act to provide more effectually for the punishment of peculation and other wrongs affecting public moneys and rights of property.â€?Section one declares u every person who with intent to defraud shall wrongfully obtain, receive, convert, pay out or dispose of . . . or in any other manner or way whatever shall. aid or abet any other in wrongfully obtaining, receiving, converting, paying ,out or disposing of any money, funds, credits or property, held or owned by this state, or held or owned officially or otherwise for or on behalf of any public or governmental interest by any municipal or other public corporation, board, officer, agency or agent, of any city, county, town, village, or civil division, sub-division, department, or portion of this state, shall, on conviction of such offense, be punished by. imprisonment in a state prison . . . &c.â€?Plaintiff in error insists the indictment is fatally defective, for the reason that it does not allege that the bonds charged to have been obtained and received by him were held by the comptroller of the city of Buffalo for or on behalf of any pub-lip or governmental interest.
The indictment chargÃ©s: First: The city of Buffalo was and is a municipal corporation, duly organized and incorporated. Second : That Thomas B. Clinton was an officer of said city of Buffalo, to wit, comptroller of said city. Third : That on the first of October, 1875, at the city of Buffalo, as such officer of said city of Buffalo, â€?the said Thomas B. Clinton held officially for and on behalf of the said city of Buffalo, such city and municipal corporation as aforesaid, a large quantity of bonds of the said city of Buffalo, to wit: Two hundred bonds of the said city of Buffalo, such city and municipal corporation as aforesaid, then and there unpaid and unsatisfied, of the kind known as City and Connty Hall bonds, and of the denomination of one thousand dollars, each bond of the vahie of $1000, each bond the credits, funds and property of the said city of Buffalo, such city and municipal corporation as aforesaid. Fourth : That on the first day of October, 1875, at the city of Buffalo aforesaid,. Joseph Berk, with intent to defraud the said city of Buffalo, such city and municipal corporation as aforesaid, feloniously, fraudulently, wickedly and wrongfully, did obtain and receive from some person or persons to the jurors aforesaid unknown,. and did convert to his own use, pay out and dispose of a large quantity of bonds, to wit: One hundred bonds of the said city of Buffalo, such city and municipal corporation as aforesaid, then and there unpaid and unsatisfied, of the denomination of one thousand dollars each bond, and of the value of one thousand dollars each bond, and of the value in the aggregate of one hundred thousand dollars, a further or more particular description of which said bonds, and of the kind, quantity and value of which said bonds is to the jurors aforesaid unknown, of the funds, credits, and property of the said city of Buffalo, such city and municipal corporation as aforesaid, then and there held so as aforesaid by said Thomas It. Clinton, such officer as aforesaid of the city of Buffalo, such city and municipal corporation as aforesaid, officially for and on behalf of said city of Buffalo, such city and municipal corporation as aforesaid, to the great damage of the said city of Buffalo, such city and municipal corporation as aforesaid, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace of the people of the state of New York, and their dignity.â€?All elements and incidents of the crime, as the same is defined by the statute, are contained in the indictment. Phelps v. People, 72 N. Y. 334.
The bonds when held by Clinton, the comptroller, were by him held for the city of Buffalo. They -were held by him officially for and on behalf of said city. That city is â€?a public or governmental interest,â€?and when they were held by the comptroller, they were held for and on behalf of a public or governmental interest, by a municipal .or public corporation. The bonds were the property of the city, and the fraudulent receiving of them, the fraudulently disposing of them, obtaining, converting or paying out thereof (they being the property of the city) was a crime, within the intent and meaning of the statute.
All the facts needful in proof for the people to establish the crime defined by the statute were averred. The case is unlike Wood v. People (53 N. Y. 511), where it was needful to prove a pardon or discharge upon the expiration of his sentence, as the statute required, to establish the crime as a second offense.
It was said in that cÃ¡se that the indictment must aver all the things that make the offense. Folger, J., in People v. Phelps (72 N. Y. 355), says that, â€?the reason of that rule is to inform the accused of the leading grounds of the charge ; to enable the court to pronounce the proper judgment affixed by law to the combination of facts alleged, and to enable the party to plead, the judgment in ""bar of a second prosecution.â€?We think the requirements of the rule, an averment of the elements and leading grounds of the charge under the statute, were satisfied and complied with so fulty that the indictment should be upheld and pronounced by us sufficient under the statute.
The bonds in the hands of the comptroller were property. The paper and labor thereon had been procured by the city, to enable it to put them into the public market upon which to obtain a loan of money, in accordance with a statute authorizing the city to do so. People v. Wiley, 3 Hill, 194; Commonwealth v. Rand, 7 Metcalf, 476; Reg. v. Morris, 9 Carrington & Payne, 347; People v. Campbell, 4 Parker, 386; U. S. v. Nolton, 5 Mason, 537.
The jury have found that the plaintiff in error wrongfully with intent to defraud, obtained, received, and disposed of the funds, credit or property of the city, and that finding is supported by evidence, and we must accept their conclusion, in the consideration of the questions presented.
Their verdict was warranted by the evidence produced upon the trial.
It was not error to receive in evidence the resolution of the Common Council, authorizing the issue of the bonds, nor proof of the statutes under which the bonds were issued. These facts were proper to establish the validity of the bonds, and their value incidentally depended upon the authority upon which they were issued. Having found no error in the course of the trial, we must affirm the conviction.
Conviction affirmed and proceedings remitted to the Oyer and Terminer of Erie county, with directions to proceed thereon.

1164457,BORK v. PEOPLE,1883-01,"Andrews, Ch. J.
The indictment under which the conviction was had, which is now the subject of review, was found under the act of February 17,1875 (chap. 19), entitled, â€œAn act to provide more effectually for the punishment of peculation and other wrongs affecting public moneys and rights of property.â€?The first section, which defines the offense of which the defendant was convicted, is as follows : â€?Â§ 1. Every person who, with intent to defraud, shall wrongfully obtain, receive, convert, pay out, or dispose of, or who, with like intent, by willfully paying, allowing, or auditing any false or unjust claim, or in any other manner or way whatever, shall aid or abet any other in wrongfully obtaining, receiving, converting, paying out, or disposing of, any money, fund, credits, or property, held or owned by this state, or held or owned, officially or otherwise, for or on behalf of any public or governmental interest, by any municipal or other public corporation, board, officer, agency, or agent of any city, county, town, village or civil division, sub-division, department or portion of this state, shall, upon conviction of such offense, be punished by imprisonment in a state prison for a term not less than three - years, nor more than ten years, or by a fine not exceeding five times the loss resulting from the fraudulent act or acts which he shall have so committed, aided or abetted, to be ascertained as hereinafter mentioned, or by both such fine and imprisonment.â€?The indictment charges, in the con junctive, that the defendant, with intent to defraud, did feloniously and wrongfully obtain, receive, convert, and dispose of the bonds mentioned. The statute is pointed against the criminal misapplication of public funds or property. The offense may be committed in any one of the several ways mentioned, that is, by receiving, obtaining, converting, etc., such funds or property wrongfully with intent to defraud. It was not necessary to prove that the defendant did all the specific acts charged in the indictment, to justify a conviction. It was sufficient to prove that he did any one of the acts constituting the offense. Where an offense may be committed by doing any one of several things, the indictment may, in a single count, group them together, and charge the defendant tb have committed them all, and a conviction may be had on proof of - the commission of any one of the things, without proof of the commission of the others. People v. Davis, 56 N. Y. 95.
The question whether the proof established a wrongful receiving by Bork of the City and County Hall bonds, as charged in the indictment, was fully argued by the respective counsel. We do not deem it necessary to determine this question! There is much plausibility in the suggestion, that as the bonds were delivered to Bork by the comptroller, voluntarily, and according to the established course in respect to the bonds of the city, intended for negotiation, and without any request by Bork, or any fraud or artifice on his part to induce the delivery, he could not be deemed to have received or obtained them wrongfully. The fact that Bork was then a defaulter, and that he misappropriated a portion of the bonds soon after they come to liis possession, is claimed on the other hand to furnish an inference that when he received them he intended to defraud the city, and that, if such intention existed, he received them wrongfully within the statute. Whatever may be the correct view of this question, it is unnecessary to decide, for the reason that assuming,, as the defendantâ€™s counsel contends, that Bork did not wrongfully receive or obtain the bonds, his subsequent delivery of the bonds to the broker in Hew York for sale, accompanied with a direction to credit Lyon & Co., with the proceeds of sale of twelve of the bonds, was a clear conversion of these bonds, it being his intention, as the jury have found, to appropriate them to the use of his firm. The bonds were delivered by the comptroller to Bork for a specific purpose, viz: for sale in the city of Hew York for the city of Buffalo. The authority, conferred doubtless included an authority to sell them through a broker according to the custom. But the direction to sell the bonds for and on behalf of the city, was inseparable from the authority to sell, and a sale for his own benefit was not a sale within the power. His direction to sell the bonds and credit the proceeds to Lyon & Co., was the exercise of a dominion over them, inconsistent with the right of the true owner, and was a conversion of the bonds. Whether the indictment, charging Bork with the conversion of the proceeds, might not have been sustained, is not material. That the transaction may be treated as a conversion of the bonds is plain. The principle was decided in Commonwealth v. Butteriek (100 Mass. 1), where it was held that an indictment for the embezzlement of a promissory note, taken by the defendant to be discounted at a bank for another person, was supported by proof that the defendant procured the note to be discounted at the same bank on his own account and the proceeds placed to his own credit. We are therefore, of opinion that the proof sustains the conviction on the merits, unless the learned counsel is right in the contention that, assuming a conversion of the bonds, still the case is not within the statute.
Bork, at the time of this transaction, was treasurer of the city of Buffalo. It is insisted that he received the bonds by virtue of his office as treasurer, or, if not strictly as an official trust, at least as the servant or agent of the city, and that his conversion of them constituted the crime of embezzlement (2 R. S. 678, Â§Â§ 59, 60 ; Laws 1874, ch. 207). It is further claimed that the statute of 1875 was not intended to apply to the offense of embezzlement, already defined and punishable by existing laws, but was intended to make something criminal, which was. not criminal before, and that this new offense, while neither larceny nor embezzlement, was something else of which the ingredient to defraud the public, was the essential element, but which was not' before the subject of indictment. This argument overlooks, we think, the purpose and language of the statute in question. We have no doubt that frauds by private persons holding no fiduciary relations to the state or a municipality, are within the purview of the act. But we think the act applies to cases within its general language, whether the offender is an officer, agent, or servant having the custody of the funds charged to have been, misappropriated or owing a special duty in relation thereto, or a private individual having no official or other confidential relation to the state or municipality defrauded by his act.
It is a part of the public history of the time, that when the act was passed, public attention had been recently called to gross frauds committed by municipal officers, especially in the city of Mew York, in the abstraction, diversion, and embezzlement of public funds and property. The malfeasance of officials intrusted with public means and property, was the danger especially apprehended. Without their direct act or connivance, it would be difficult to accomplish the frauds against which the statute was aimed. It was one of the purposes of the act, as the word peculation in the title indicates, and, perhaps, its primary purpose, to afford additional security against the betrayal of official trusts, by imposing severer punishment for embezzlements, or other frauds, when committed by public officers in misapplying public property, than was provided by existing laws. The language of the statute defining who may be offenders is as broad and comprehensive as possible. â€?Every person â€?is the language used. The acts constituting the offense include the wrongful pa/yvng out of public funds, and the willful paying, allowing, or auditing an unjust claim with intent to defraud. These particular acts could ordinarily only be committed by officers or agents having a duty to perform in respect to the public funds, or clothed with a public trust in the adjustment of claims. Moreover, the second section of the act is framed to meet the case of a wrongful transfer by public officers of deposits in banks of any credit, claim, chose in action, or right, or demand belonging to the public, by which the public right shall be defeated or impaired, and declares that such transfer shall be deemed a conversion within the act. And finally, to put it beyond doubt that offenses punishable by existing laws were not excluded from the purview of the act, it is declared in the third section, that if on any trial (under the act) â€œit shall appear that the acts of which the defendant was guilty constitute any other crime, he shall not, by reason thereof, be entitled to an acquittal; but after such trial and judgment, he shall not be liable to prosecution for such other crime.â€?It was certainly competent for the Legislature to provide, by an independent statute, that certain acts of embezzlement, punishable by the existing statute, should constitute a distinct offense, and affix a severer punishment than was provided by the general law relating to that class of offenses.
The effect of the construction of the act of 1875, claimed by the defendant, viz.: that it applies to frauds by private persons only, would be to subject them to a much greater punishment than is visited upon faithless officials guilty of embezzlement, a crime of greater turpitude than the fraud of a private person, involving, as it does, in addition to the element of fraud, a breach of public trust, and it is difficult to suppose that such discrimination was intended.
We are of opinion, therefore, that, assuming that the facts proved constitute the crime of embezzlement, the indictment was properly framed, and the conviction legally had, under the statute of 1875. It was unnecessary to aver in the indictment the fiduciary relation of the defendant. In an indictment for embezzlement, under the statute of embezzlement, such an averment is essential (Com. v. Simpson, 9 Met. 138), because the existence of that relation is an essential element of the crime. Under the statute of 1875, that is not the case, as the offense may be committed either by an officer, servant or agent, or by a person occupying no such position. The evidence that Bork was, in fact, treasurer, was not, however, objectionable. It was one of the facts of the case, and tended to illustrate and explain other pertinent facts.
The further point was taken on the trial, and is urged on the appeal that the bonds, not having been issued when they were received by Boric, had no intrinsic value, and were not â€?money, funds, credit or property â€?of the city of Buffalo, within the descriptive words of the statute. It is incontestable that they did not become valid obligations of the city of Buffalo until they had an inception by the -transfer and sale. But they were, when received by Bork, complete in form and capable of becoming effective instruments by delivery to a Iona fide holder. We think they were properly described as bonds in the indictment, and that they were, though unissued, property within the meaning of the statute of 1875.
In People v. Wiley (3 Hill, 194), the indictment charged the receiving by the defendant of â€?ten promissory notes, usually called bank-notes, of the value,â€?etc., knowing them to have been stolen. The proof was that the bills were stolen from the bank, whose bills they xvere, and which, though complete in form, had never been issued. The court sustained the conviction.
In Commonwealth v. Band (7 Met. 475), the indictment was for the larceny of certain bank bills which had been redeemed by the bank, and were in the hands of its agent at the time of the theft. Â»The statute of Massachusetts specified bank bills as the subject of larceny, and the court held that the indictment was sufficient.
The counsel for the defendant refers to the case of People v. Loomis (4 Denio 380), in which it was held that stealing a receipt from the hands of the party wdiose act it is, it never having taken effect by delivery, is not larceny. The stealing of personal property, and not of personal goods, as at common law, is by the Bevised Statutes (2 R. S. 679, Â§ 63), larceny, and the words personal property, as used in the chapter containing the section above referred to, are declared to mean â€?goods, chattels, effects, evidence of rights in action, and all written instruments by which any pecuniary obligation, or any right or title of' property, real or personal, should be created, acknowledged, ' transferred, increased, defeated, discharged or diminished.â€?An unissued receipt is not within the descriptive terms of this statute, and if stolen from the person who signed it, it neither defeats, discharges, nor diminishes any right. The only possible consequence is to subject the. party signing it to inconvenience, in showing the circumstances under which the possession was obtained, but this element does not make the transaction larceny within the statute. The learned judge who delivered the opinion in People v. Loomis, justifies his conclusion by reference to some early English cases, among others, Walshâ€™s case (R. & R. Cr. Cas. 215), which arose under Stat. 2 Geo. II., ch. 25, in it was held that a check signed, but not delivered while it remained in the hands of the owner, is not the subject of larceny. By that statute, the stealing of certain written securities was made larceny, but the statute declared that the money due thereon, or secured thereby, and remaining unsatisfied, should be taken as the value of the securities stolen, and the court construed the statute as referring to securities which were valid outstanding securities, and which were, therefore, presumptively of the value of the sum expressed therein, which could not be true of unissued instruments. In the case of Bex v. Metcalf (1 Moody's Cr. Cas. 433), which arose under Stat. 7 and 8, Geo. IV., ch. 29, Â§ 5 (which, in describing the instruments which are subjects of larceny, uses very nearly the same language as Stat. 2, George II.), it appeared that the prisoner, who was occasionally employed by the prosecutors, having received from them a check on their bankers, payable to a creditor for the purpose of giving it to the creditor, appropriated it to his own use, and it was held by the judges on a ease reserved to be a larceny of the check. The same ""point was ruled in Beg. v. Heath (2 Moodyâ€™s Cr. Cas. 33).
The case of People v. Loomis was clearly not a case of larceny within the Be vised Statutes. It does not control the question now before us, which depends on the construction of the words â€?money, funds, credits or property,â€?in the act of 1875.
We think the cases of People v. Wiley and Commonwealth v. Band (supra), support the conclusion we have reached on this branch of the case.
There was no error in admitting in evidence the affidavit of Bork, made in January, 1876. It tended strongly to establish his fraudulent purpose in directing the proceeds of the twelve bonds to be passed to the credit of Lyon & Co.
The point that the bonds were not averred in the indictment to have been held on behalf of â€?any public or governmental interest,â€?is not tenable. The bonds of a city which can only be paid by taxation, if property in the corporation, under the statute of 1875, although unissued, as we have held, were public property, and were mainly held for a â€?public or governmental interest,â€?whatever this' somewhat obscure language may mean, and it wTas not necessary to aver what is necessarily implied, in the description in the indictment. So also it was unnecessary that the indictment should allege that the bonds were negotiable. This was matter of description. The indictment alleges that the bonds were the property of the city, arid if the truth of this averment depended upon their negotiable or non-negotiable character, the question could be made on the trial, and could not be raised by demurrer, or on motion in arrest of judgment.
We find no error in the record, and the conviction should therefore be affirmed.
All concur, except Rapallo, J., absent.
Mem.â€”After the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of affirmance in this case, a motion was made by defendant for a reargument on two grounds, which it was claimed had escaped the attention of the court on the appeal.
I. There is no evidence of a conversion of the bonds in the county of Erie.
II. The verdict is void for want of a finding by the jury of the value of the property converted.
This motion was denied by the Court of Appeals (March 6, 1883), the following opinion being written:
Per Curiam.
The question whether the verdict is defective is not presented by any exception, and cannot be considered upon this record. Whether a sentence can be imposed upon the verdict is a matter not now before us.
The other point, upon which a reargument is asked, also raises a question suggested for the first time on this motion. The answer is the same as to. the other pointâ€”that there is no exception which renders it available here.
The motion for re-argument will therefore be denied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164447,PEOPLE v. BORK,1883-05,"Haight, J.
Section 527 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, provides that â€?an appeal to the Supreme Court on a judgment of conviction, or other determination, from which an appeal can be taken, stays the execution of the judgment or determination upon filing with the notice of appeal a certificate of the judge who presided at the trial, or of a judge of the Supreme Court, that in his opinion there is reasonable doubt whether the judgment should stand, but not otherwise,â€?etc.
The defendant now moves under this section for a certificate upon which the execution of the judgment entered against him upon his conviction of the crime of embezzlement may be stayed, pending his appeal from Ihe judgment, and from the order denying his motion in arrest of judgment. The district attorney contends that he â–?has had a review by the General Term and Court of Appeals, and is now entitled to no further hearing.
The practice is, to some extent, confused, by reason of the change from the Revised Statutes to the Code of Criminal Procedure. The conviction took place under the Revised Statutes, and before the Criminal Code went into effect. Under the Revised Statutes, two modes of review were givenâ€”one after conviction and before judgment by certiorari, the other after judgment by writ of error. Under the Criminal Code, writs of error and certiorari are abolished, and the only mode of review now given is by appeal. â–?Section 517 of the Code provides that an appeal to the Supreme Court may be taken by the defendant from the judgment on a conviction after indictment, and upon the appeal any actual decision of the court in an intermediate order or proceeding, forming a part of the judgment roll, as prescribed by Section 485, may be reviewed. This section only gives the right of appeal after judgment. No review can now be had after conviction and before sentence. The old system was found to be cumbersome, and resulted in unnecessary delay. All of the questions sought to be reviewed, can be reviewed afte^ sentence as well as before. See Revisersâ€?notes. In his case, after conviction, a certificate staying sentence was obtained, and the case was removed by certiorari into the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, at General Term, affirmed the conviction, and the case was then removed by writ of error to the Court of Appeals. That court heard and passed upon all the questions raised, and has affirmed the conviction. That decision is final, as to all the questions that can be raised by the record at that time.
The case was remitted to the Oyer and Terminer of Erie county for sentence. Before sentence was pronounced, the defendant moved that judgment be arrested, upon the ground that the verdict failed to specify and find the value of the property embezzled. The motion was denied, and from this order appeal has been taken. This question was not raised by the record before the General Term or the Court of Appeals, and was consequently not passed upon by either of these courts. The order is an intermediate order, within the provisions of Section 517, from which an appeal can be taken. The certificate mentioned in Section 527 can, in a proper case, be given in any case in which an appeal can be taken.
The order from which the appeal has been taken denies the defendantâ€™s motion to arrest judgment. It is claimed that sentence could not be lawfully passed for the reason that the verdict failed to specify the value of the property embezzled. The statute provides, â€?that the defendant shall, on conviction, be punished by imprisonment in a state prison, for a term not less than three years or more than ten years, or by a fine not exceeding five times the loss resulting from the fraudulent act or acts which he shall have so permitted, aided or abetted, to be ascertained as hereinafter mentioned, or by both such imprisonment and fine. When rendering a verdict of guilty upon the trial of any person indicted under this act, the jury may find and determine with the verdict the amount of, loss resulting from the offense of the defendant.â€?The indictment charges the unlawful appropriation of two hundred bonds of the city of Buffalo, of the denomination of $1,000 each, and of the value of $1,000 each, making a total valuation of $200,000. The verdict was a general verdict of guilty. It appears tome that this verdict is a finding as to the valueâ€”is a material allegation of the indictment. The verdict found is a finding of all the material allegations of the indictment. This view gives full force and effect to the provisions of the statute. If the value, as alleged in the indictment, be the same as proved upon tire trial, the verdict of guilty, as alleged in the indictment, is proper. If the value alleged in the indictment should be different from that established from the evidence, the jury, in rendering a verdict of guilty, may find and state with their veiâ€™dict the amount of loss resulting from the offense, etc. This view, as to the effect of a general verdict, appears to me to be sustained by the reasoning in the case of Williams v. People, 24 N. Y. 405. It is true that the question was not raised in that case, but it would appear to follow from the argument employed. I have not been able to find any case in this state in which the precise question has been decided. In Wisconsin, however, the question appears to have been settled in the case of the State v. White (25 Wis. 350), in which it was held that a general verdict of guilty is a finding of the truth of all the material averments in the indictment, including the averment of value when value is material. To the same effect, also, is the case of Schoonhover v. State, 11 Ohio, 7 Critchfield, 294.
Appeal has also been taken from the judgment, and it is now claimed that the court which pronounced sentence was improperly constituted ; that it was composed of persons who were not members of the court. The judgment record shows that the court was composed of a justice of this court and two justices of Sessions, naming them. Section 23 of the Code-provides that the Court of Oyer and Terminer is held by a justice of the Supreme Court, without associates. Justices of Sessions are no longer members of the Oyer and Terminer. The remittitur from the appellate court to the Oyer and Terminer for sentence was to that court as now organized by statute, and sentence should have been pronounced by the justice holding the court without associates. This has recently been held in the General Term of this Department in the case of the People v. Ostrander, convicted of murder ; opinion by Hardin, Judge. But I am at a loss to understand how this question is raised for review. Ho exception is taken or objection made to the power of the court as constituted to pass judgment. There was, in fact, a court of Oyer and Terminer, sitting at which a justice of this court presided, and that court had jurisdiction to pass judgment in the case. The Court of Appeals have recently held, in this case, on a motion for re-argument, that it could not consider the question as to whether the verdict should have found the value of the property embezzled, for the reason that there was no exception that raised the question. In the case of Messner v. People (45 N. Y. 1), it was held that before sentence the court must ask the prisoner if he has any cause to show why judgment should not now be pronounced against him; and that a failure to give him .this opportunity to show cause was error; that that deprived him of a substantial legal right. It was his right, at this stage, to move in arrest of judgment for any legal defect in the indictment or other proceedings. He can then object to the jurisdiction of the court or its power under the statute, to pass judgment upon him. He can then take such exceptions as will protect his rights on appeal. This is the last act before judgment; it is the last opportunity for the prisoner to be heard. This opportunity was given to the prisoner, as appears from the judgment record. Ho objection was then made,"" or exception taken, to the court as constituted, and, consequently, no exception is presented by the appeal for review.
Mv conclusion is that the certificate should be refused. The questions presented are important; but my convictions are as above expressed, and so firm are they that I am unable to say that there is a reasonable doubt remaining. Punishment in this case has been long delayed. Seven years and upwards have elapsed. The case is of great public importance. The courts should be zealous in securing to the prisoner every right that is given him by statute, after which speedy punishment should follow. The prisoner has had the benefit of one stay, under which his case has been taken to the court of last resort, where all the questions raised by him were discussed and disposed of. ""Under the circumstances 1 am of the opinion that no further stay should be granted.
Certificate refused.

1164471,PEOPLE ex rel. BORK v. GILBERT,1883-05,"Macomber, J.
After the verdict of the jury, in 1881, convicting the prisoner Bork of the crime of embezzlement, the case was removed by certiorari from the court of Oyer and Terminer to this court. That process removed the entire record from the Oyer and Terminer to this court. The conviction being affirmed in the General Term, the case w'as taken to the Court of Appeals by a writ of error, and that court affirmed the decision, and remitted the case to the Oyer and Terminer to pronounce judgment, which had not before been done. The certiorari and writ of error transferred the case out of the. Oyer and Terminer completely, so that there was nothing pending m that court.
The provisions of the Criminal Code preserving the old organization of the court of Oyer and Terminer in cases pending therein, have no application to this case. For when the Court of Appeals directed that the Oyer and Terminer pronounce judgment, and remitted the case to the Oyer and Terminer, the court was organized solely by one justice of the Supreme Court, the statute saying that the Court of Oyer and Terminer is held by one justice without any associate.
This court, at a recent general term, in the casÃ© of Ostrander v. People, "" held that, in a case that had been taken to the Court of Appeals, the statute having been changed in the mean time, the court of Oyer and Terminer was organized by a single judge without any associate.
It is sought, by counsel for the prisoner here, to apply that decision to the case of Bork, so that he may receive his discharge because he was sentenced by a tribunal illegally constituted. It has been held in this state, uniformly, since the case of Cancemi v. People, 18 N. Y. 128, that in the matter of the organization of the court, in cases of felony, nothing that goes to the composition or jurisdiction of the court can be waived, even by the prisoner.
The sole question in this case is whether the court that pronounced this sentence, was a court at allâ€”whether it was a body of persons having no jurisdiction, or whether the error of' allowing the two justices of Sessions to sit there, was a mere irregularity. If their presence was a matter of substance; if it can be clearly seen that their presence necessarily affected the judgment, it would doubtless be regarded as a matter of jurisdictional import, and the sentence doubtless would have to be vacated and the prisoner remanded to that court for a new sentence. But, in my judgment, it was a mere irregularity; a justice of this court was present; the judgment of the court was pronounced by him; it was at a term of the Oyer and Terminer, over which a justice of this court alone can preside. The circumstance that he called upon two men, who were justices of Sessions, to sit by his side, is of no more significance than if he had called upon two personal friends to sit on the bench with him. If the prisoner had any reason to believe that the presence of these gentlemen on the bench would affect his case prejudicially to him, an objection should have been made, and, if objection had been made, it doubtless would have been regarded as a good objection, and would have been sustained, and the presiding justice would have dismissed these two gentlemen, who happened to be justices of Sessions.
This is all there is of the case; it is all that can be said about it. I must remand the prisoner to the custody of the warden of the state prison at Auburn.

1164461,PEOPLE v. LYON,1883-08,"Barker, J.
On a prior day of this term the defendant was convicted of the offense charged in the indictment.
The defendant moves for a new trial on a case and exceptions.
The indictment is grounded on chapter 19, Laws of 1875, entitled â€?An act to provide more effectually for the punishment of peculation and other wrongs affecting public moneys and rights of property.â€?Section 1 creates and defines the offense, and is as follows : â€?Every person who, with intent to defraud, shall wrongfully obtain, receive, convert, pay out, or dispose of, ' or who, with like intent, by willfully paying, allowing or auditing any false -or unjust claim, or in any other manner or way whatever, shall aid or abet any other in wrongfully obtaining, receiving, converting, paying out, or disposing of any money, funds, credits, or property, held or owned by this state, or held or owned, officially or otherwise, for or on behalf o.f any public â€¢or government interest, by any municipal or other public â– corporation, board, officer, agency or agent of any city, county, town, village or civil division, subdivision, department or portion of this state, shall, on conviction of such offense, be punished by imprisonment in a state prison for a term not less than three years or more than ten years, or by a fine not exceeding five times the. loss resulting from the fraudulent act or acts which he shall have committed, aided or abetted, to be ascertained, as hereinafter mentioned, or by both imprisonment and fine.â€?The indictment in substance charges that on the 14th day of September, 1875, Joseph Bork was treasurer of the city of Buffalo, and as such officer was custodian of the moneys and funds belonging to the city, and had in his possession large sums of money, and on that day defendant wrongfully and fraudulently received from the hands of Bork thÃ© sum of twenty-two hundred dolÃ­ais, the funds and money of the city. Bork was the city treasurer for the period of four years, from January, 1872, until the 31st day of December, 1875. During all this time the defendant and Bork were copartners, as bankers and real estate agents, their offices being in the city of Buffalo. As bankers the business was carried on under the firm name of Lyon & Co.; as real estate- agents under the style of Lyon, Bork & Co., each member giving active and personal attention to the business. Soon after. Bork was inducted into office he commenced abstracting funds in his hands as city treasurer, and using the same in the copartnership business; at the end of his term of office the sums thus purloined amounted in the aggregate to over four hundred thousand dollars. The moneys were abstracted in various ways and on many different occasions, before and after the passage of the act mentioned. In' some instances cash on hand was taken directly from the drawers and safe in the city treasurerâ€™s office and there used in that business. In other instances, bonds issued by the city and duly authorized by law were negotiated by Bork, in his official capacity, in the city of New York, for and on account of the city of Buffalo, and a portion of the proceeds of such sales was by his direction deposited to the credit of Lyon & Co., with their correspondents in that city, and the same was afterward drawn out on their drafts and on their account. On the books kept by Lyon & Co. entries were made of these transactions, plainly indicating that the funds of the city were being used in the business carried on by Bork and the defendant.
The defendant resided in the city of Buffalo, and when in town he visited the business office daily, having an opportunity to inspect the books containing such accounts. The evidence fully tends to prove, and to my mind satisfactorily establishes, that on the day mentioned in the indictment, under the personal direction of Bork, twenty-two hundred dollars, consisting of cash items, was taken from the city treasurerâ€™s office, being the funds of the city, and used in the banking business of Lyon & Co. It is conceded that, on the day this transaction occurred, Lyon was not in the city, but was in the territory of Utah, where he had been for several weeks prior to this occurrence. It was not claimed on the trial, nor is it now insisted upon, by the people, that the defendant had personal knowledge of the conversion and use of this particular sum of money. The theory of the prosecution is, that prior to this time and soon after Bork became treasurer, and before the passage of the act upon which the indictment is based, that Bork and the defendant combined together, planned and arranged, that whenever the business in which they were engaged as copartners should be in need of money beyond their own resources, Bork should supply the same out of the money and funds in his hands as city treasurer, and that such arrangement continued and was acted upon up to and including the time when the sum was. taken as charged in the indictment. That all the money which Bork did, in fact, take from the funds of the city and use in the copartnership business, was with the actual consent of Lyon, and in pursuance of the original understanding and conspiracy.
That the prisoner had personal knowledge that moneys belonging to the city were being used in the copartnership business, is overwhelmingly established by the evidence. That he was aware of the fact from about the time the first sums were taken, cannot be doubted ; that he never protested against the practice, and used in his private business, in an indirect manner, a portion of the proceeds, is, to my mind, abundantly proved.
The verdict is not against the weight of evidence, but is firmly sustained by it. Every fact upon which the people relied, to sustain a conviction, is supported by evidence and circumstances so convincing in their character that no impartial and intelligent man can doubt as to the truth of the same.
. The correctness of some of the rulings on the trial depends upon the question whether the offense created by the statute is a felony or a misdemeanor. The statute creates and defines the offense and provides for its punishment. The grade of the offense is not mentioned in the statute nor classified as a felony or a misdemeanor. On conviction, the punishment to be inflicted is largely in the discretion of the court; it may be imprisonment in the state prison for a term of yearsâ€”not less than three or more than tenâ€”or by a fine not exceeding five times the loss resulting from the fraudulent act, or by both such imprisonment and fine.
The provision for an imprisonment in a state prison, a degrading punishment, does not necessarily make the offense a felony; but the other provision that the punishment may be limited to a mere nominal fine, makes it a misdemeanor onlyâ€?and such was evidently the intention of the legislature. The discretion vested in the court, to grade the punishment, is exceptionally large. It will be observed that for wrongfully converting the smallest sum of money, with an intent to cheat and defraud, the offender may be sentenced to inprisonment for the full period of ten years, and for purloining an amount as large as the sum which was used in the defendantâ€™s business, the punishment may be limited to a nominal fine.
In this state there are no general statutes defining a felony, nor naming the offense which may be deemed one. The common law distinction between felony and misdemeanor is preserved and continued, and when not declared by statute, the same must be resorted to determine the grade and character of the offense. By the common law felony is defined â€œas an offense which occasions a total forfeiture of either lands or goods, or both, and to which capital or other punishment may be superadded, according to the degree of guilt.â€?Blacks. Com. 94.
The statutory definition of felony, as given in (he second Revised Statutes, 702, section 30, does not make the offense created by this statute a felony. That section provides that the term â€?felony,â€?when used in any statute, shall be construed to mean an offense for which the offender on conviction shall be liable by law to be punishable by death or by imprisonment in a state prison. It purports to give a statutory definition of the word â€?felony â€?when used in a statute, and does not assume to define the meaning of the term felony except when it is used in some statute. The enactment upon which the indictment is based does not use the term felony. This section does not declare that every offense punishable in a state prison is a felony, nor does such a conclusion necessarily follow from its language. Fasset v. Smith, 23 N. Y. 252; Mowrey v. Walsh, 8 Cow. 238.
As an offender convicted of a felony is deprived of many of the privileges of citizenship, and stands degraded in the minds of the public more than if convicted of a misdemeanor only, it is important that the offense created by this statute be properly ' classified, and I am of the opinion that it is not a felony. As the sum of money mentioned in the indictment was, in fact, transferred to the business of the defendant, he is brought within ' the provisions of the statute, and is guilty of receiving and converting to his own use public money belonging to the municipality of the city of Buffalo. The same having been accomplished through his own pre-arranged plan with the city treasurer, the act was in every sense wrongful, and, upon all the evidence, a case was' made for the jury to say whether it was done with an intent to defraud the city. An attempt is made to escape criminal liability, for the reason that at the time the offense was consummated by transferring the fund from the city treasury to the banking business of the defendant, he was out of the state, and did not personally do the act which completed the offense. The prisoner is indicted as principal and not as an accessory. In misdemeanors, all guilty participators are held and treated as principals. The jury having found that the money was taken by Bork, and used in the co-partnership business, in pursuance of a pre-existing arrangement between Bork and the defendant, the act of Bork, bis instrument, is in the law deemed his own act. The circumstance that Bork was a guilty and not an innocent agent, does not change â– the law. If the crime was of the .grade of a felony, then the rule would be different, for when an offense of that grade is com-. mitted, through the agency of a guilty.instrument, the principal is regarded as an accessory before the fact, and must be indicted and tried as such. In the ease of a felony, however, if the agent be innocent, for reason of lunacy, idiocy, or other cause, then the procurer may be indicted as principal. As to the correctness of these propositions, there is no controversy, as they are fundamental and recognized in our criminal law. People v. Erwin, 4 Denio, 129 ; Irvine v. Wood, 51 N. Y. 224; Wixson v. People, 5 Park. 121; Russell on Crimes, 27.
As it was not necessary for the defendant to be present at the time' the crime was consummated, to make him a guilty party, it is wholly immaterial whether he was within or without the state at the time the money was purloined from the .city treasury. He cannot be heard to say that he was beyond the Â° jurisdiction of the state. Our laws were violated by the act and procurement of the prisoner, although he was absent at the time,, and cannot claim that he was guiltless. Every act which constitutes the crime charged iii the indictment was done and performed within our jurisdiction; the money abstracted was owned by a municipality created by the laws of this stateâ€”it was used and converted in the business of the defendant, carried on here ; his accomplice was a local officer, having the lawful custody of the money misappropriated. The defendant did no act, while absent from the state, which aided in the consummation of the crime that he planned before his departure. If he is not amenable to the laws of this state, then he must be regarded as entirely guiltless, as he has not violated the laws in any other state. The prisoner is a citizen of this state, and owes allegiance to its laws ; having entered into a conspiracy to violate the same, for his own personal gain and advantage, he should not escape punishment because the act which he planned was accomplished during his temporary absence from our jurisdiction. If this were so, our criminal laws could be violated with impunity and rogues would have the advantage. The protection from punishment, which the defendant seeks in the proposition presented, is repudiated and condemned in many well considered cases both here and in England. People v. Adams, 3 Denio, 190, affirmed in 1 N. Y. 173; King v. Johnston, 7 East, 65 ; People v. Erwin, 4 Denio, 128 ; People ex rel. Sherwin v. Mead, 28 Hun, 227; affirmed in the Court of Appeals, 1883.'
On the trial the people were permitted to prove, by Boric as a witness, several instances in which he used the funds of the city in the business of Lyon & Co., which occurred after the time of the alleged conspiracy, up to and including the transaction set forth in the indictment. This evidence was objected to on the part of the defendant as incompetent and immaterial, and as tending to prove violations of the statute not set forth in the indictment. The objection was overruled and the defendant excepted. The evidence thus objected to and received, related to numerous transactions, tending to prove the conversions of sums of money belonging to the city and used in the business of Lyon & Co. The proof was confined to transactions which took place after the time of the alleged conspiracy, and none of the evidence was received until after the evidence had been given tending to prove that such plan and scheme had been entered into between the prisoner and the witness. At the time the evidence was received, it was ruled by the court and the jury were then instructed that the evidence was not received, and should not be used by them with a view of establishing that the sum of money mentioned in the indictment was, in fact, taken from the city treasury and used in the business of LyÃ³n & Co.; but that the evidence was received for the purpose, and could be only used to establish guilty knowledge on the part of the defendant, and to prove that the $2,200 was received with an intent to defraud the city. With this limitation placed upon the evidence, it was, in my opinion, competent. The other evidence in the case tended to prove that a scheme and plan had been entered into between the witness and the defendant to divert to their own use the money of the city as the banking business required. Such proof also tended to establish in a very striking manner that such money was being so withdrawn from the city treasury by Bork with the prisonerâ€™s consent and used in the business with which he was connected. In addition to proving the actual wrongful conversion of the sum of money mentioned in the indictment, it was incumbent upon the people to prove that the same was done with an intent to defraud the city. As bearing upon the question of intent, it was pertinent to prove the aggregate amount of the money loaned in pursuance of the conspiracy and all the circumstances connected with each conversion of the funds of the city. This evidence was competent for the purpose for which it was received, although it may have established that the defendant was guilty of other offenses, not charged in the indictment.
The general rule is against receiving evidence of another offense. There are, however, some exceptions to this; when guilty knowledge, or an intent to defraud, is made an ingredient of the crime, then other acts of a similar character, indicating guilty' knowledge on the part of the accused, or of an intent to to cheat and defraud, may be proved, and the circumstances that such evidence may establish that other offenses have been committed by the defendant does not render the proof incompetent. This is now a well-established proposition and it was so held in the following cases. Coleman v. People, 55 N. Y. 81; Bielschofsky v. People, 3 Hun, 40; People v. Wood, 3 Park. Cr. 681; Pierson v. People, 79 N. Y. 424; Weyman v. People, 4 Hun, 511; 1 Greenl. Ev. Â§ 53; People v. Dowling, 84 N. Y. 486; Pontius v. People, 82 N. Y. 347; Commonwealth v. Eastman, 1 Cush. 189; Commonwealth v. Miller, 3 Cush. 250; Commonwealth v. Merriam, 14 Pick. 519;. Commonwealth v. Tuckerman, 10 Gray, 173.
All the evidence received related to the misappropriation of public moneys belonging to the same municipality, converted by the same parties, and devoted to the same use, in pursuance of a conspiracy entered into prior to any of the transactions to which the evidence related. The offense charged in the indictment is based upon an alleged illegal act, which was one of a series of acts of a similar nature, constituting a part of one continuous transaction. The evidence presented by the people, taken together, tended to prove that all the money misappropriated by Bork was with the consent, and received the approbation of, Lyon; that he was conscious from first to last that funds were brought into the copartnership business which came from the city treasury. The sums so transferred were on occasions so near each other and so many of them entered on the copartnership books, that it may in all reason be regarded as a continuous transaction. There was no interruption in the practice of withdrawing the money, the sums misappropriated increased in amount and frequency, and so far as they were indirectly used by Lyon, in his private business by overdrawing his account with the firm. The occurrences were near each other, not many days intervening at any time between the several and separate transactions. All these transactions had intimate relations with the one set forth in the indictment, and tended to prove all were done in pursuance of the scheme and conspiracy devised by the defendant and Bork, and with an intent to to cheat and defraud the city of Buffalo. The i'ule, as established and laid down in the authorities cited, was not, in my opinion, disregarded, but practically adhered to on the trial.
Upon the question of an intent to cheat and defraud the city, the jury were instructed that under the statute the offense was not complete unless there was an intent to cheat and defraud on the part of the defendant, and that was a question of fact for them to determine upon all the evidence. They were also instructed, that if they should find that there was an intention on the part of the defendant to return the money to the city, that it would not in and of itself prevent a conviction; but if they should find that such an intention did exist on the part of Lyon at the time he received the money, it was evidence in his favor bearing on the question of an intent to cheat and defraud the city. The learned counsel for the defendant makes the argument, that if there was in 'fact an intent to repay the city, then there could not exist a criminal intent to cheat and defraud within the spirit and meaning of the statute, and the jury should have been so instructed. This argument, should it prevail, would in effect nullify the statute, and the misappropriation of moneys which the statute intended to prevent and made criminal, might be committed with impunity if the person who is guilty of the misappropriation had enough of the sense of right left to form an intention to return, at some future time, the funds unlawfully abstracted. The abstraction must necessarily precede the restitution. The first will be completed before there is a possibility of commencing the act by which it is to be followed; and thus, whatever may be the purpose of the guilty party ultimately to do, the offense prohibited by the statute will have already been consummated before he can do any act in mitigation of the wrong he has done. It is a fraud in law for a person to appropriate to his own personal object and gain, money or the property of another when the same can only be accomplished by doing an act prohibited by a positive law. The argument presented in behalf of the defendant is not novel. The same proposition has been considered and repudiated by a court of great learning- in a case not unlike this in all essential particulars, and it is safe to follow the reasoning of the tribunal referred to as the same is found in the case of Commonwealth v. Tuckerman, 10 Gray, 173. See also Commonwealth v. Coe, 115 Mass. 481.
The defendant gave proof showing that previous to the disclosure of the transactions proved on the trial, he possessed a good character and enjoyed the reputation of being a correct and upright business man. Upon this evidence the court charged the jury in substance, that such evidence was pertinent upon the question of the defendantâ€™s guilt, and should be duly weighed and considered by them; that it might be assumed in disposing of a criminal accusation, that a person who possessed a good character would not commit an offense of the nature of the one imputed to the defendant; that good character was not a controlling item of evidence, but was to be considered with all the other evidence in the case, in disposing of the question of the defendantâ€™s guilt; that it should have greater weight where the evidence upon which the people relied for a conviction was circumstantial than where the evidence was direct and positive, and that it was for the jury to determine how much force and reliance should be placed upon the same, in the face of' all the other evidence in the case. The defendantâ€™s counsel thereupon ashed the court further to charge the jury, â€?that evidence of good character is not only of value in doubtful cases, but that it may raise a doubt in the mind of the jury where, without it, none would exist.â€?The court declined further to charge the jury upon the subject.
In the charge as given no limitation whatever was placed upon the force and effect which the jury should give to the evidence of good character. The jury were left free to apply and use this evidence upon every question of fact which they were to pass upon. It was not in the province of the court to say to the jury, as requested, that the evidence of good character might raise a doubt in their minds, as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant. People v. Lamb, 2 Keyes, 378; Cancemi v. People, 16 N. Y. 501.
If the views already expressed Ã¡re sound, then it is unnecessary to consider the many exceptions taken during the trial, to the receipt of evidence, for they only bring up in another form the questions discussed.
The motion for a new trial is dismissed.

1164462,PEOPLE v. MONGANO,1883-02,"Cullen, J.
The prisoner, a life convict, was convicted of murder in the first degree for killing a fellow-convict, Williams, at the Sing Sing state prison.
Two exceptions were taken to the charge of the court. It is urged that it was error to charge â€?that no length of time is required â€?previous to striking the blow in which to premeditate and deliberate. If it were conceded that such a statement standing by itself were erroneous, I do not think the exception- here well taken. The expression was'not a single isolated proposition submitted to the jury, but must be construed in connection with the whole contents of the charge on that point. The district attorney asked the court to charge in the language above given. â€œBy the court.â€”I will charge that no particular length of time is required, but that no time is required I will not chai -ge. (Defendant excepts). Mr. Baker.â€”I mean no appreciable length of time. The court.â€”I will charge that no length of time is required, but there must be deliberation and premeditation. (Defendant excepts).â€?Taking all of this together, the charge was unobjectionable in my opinion. In effect, it was that no particular time was necessary, provided there was deliberation and premeditation. Upon being requested to charge that the word â€?deliberate â€?has a different meaning and signification from the word â€œpremeditated,â€?the court said: â€?1 suppose there is a slight shade of difference; I will so charge.â€?To the first statement the prisoner excopted. We think there is substantial difference between those two terms as used in the statute. But we think no question was raised by the exception. The court charged as required.
It had already defined the meaning of these terms accurately. If the prisoner wished such definition made with greater minuteness, there should have been a direct request to that effect. We think, therefore, neither exception tenable. But the question is presented to us, a motion for a_new trial having been made, that the verdict is against the evidence; that is, that there was no sufficient evidence of deliberation to justify the conviction in the first degree. Formerly in criminal cases courts could not grant new trials on such ground. How by the express terms of the law a motion for that purpose can be made, and an appeal from the judgment brings before us for review the decision of such motion as well as the proceedings upon trial. The power of interfering with the verdict in a criminal case is doubtless to be exercised with caution, especially where the question of fact to be determined is one incapable of direct proof and only to be established by inference from other facts. The old decisions denied not only the- power but the propriety of vesting such power in the courts; but the legislature having cast upon the courts such duty, we are bound to exercise it. The history of this case is brief. There is little or no conflict between the witnesses or dispute as to the fact. Its salient features are beyond dispute. The deceased, one Cornetti (an Italian) and the prisoner were all at work in the prison peeling potatoes. Cornetti applied some opprobrious epithet to the ' deceased, upon which the deceased struck Cornetti with a stick. . Cornetti then seized a stick or stool and attacked the deceased.
While this altercation was transpiring, the prisoner picked up a broom and also attacked the deceased. One Coburn, a convict, but a sort of overseer over the others, slipped between the parties to stop the conflict, and' seized the defendant. A convict named Cash took the broom from the prisoner and thrust him aside the distance of two or three barrels, when the prisoner immediately took the knife which he had used in his work, rushed towards the deceased and struck him, inflicting the fatal blow. It was proved there was no dispute or ill-feeling between the parties prior to this occurrence. The whole affray lasted, according to one witness, five minittes; the others place it at from two to three minutes. The time that elapsed between the disarming of the prisoner by Cash and the striking of the blow with the knife was, according to One witness, â€?half a second,â€?according to another it was â€?instantly.â€?This is substantially the whole occurrence. How is there sufficient evidence in it to warrant the finding of the jury of deliberation on the part of the prisoner? It is true that such deliberation is incapable of proof, save as an inference from other facts. But that does not authorize the jury to arbitrarily draw such inference as they see fit. The facts must point to and warrant the inference, otherwise a verdict cannot stand. This undoubtedly is the rule in civil cases. It should hardly be less potent where life is involved. The inference is generally proved1 by the nature of the occurrence, the manner in which the crime is committed, the weapon, threats, or expression of hostile feeling toward the deceased, or preparation on the part of the prisoner. But this case seems barren of all such features. There is not ground even for suspicion that prior to the altercation the prisoner meditated an injury to the deceased. When the fight between deceased and Cornetti occurred the prisoner attacked the deceased, but with a weapon not calculated to inflict fatal or even serious injuries. For, while many blows were struck by Cornetti and the deceased, who were similarly armed, no serious results followed to either party.' When disarmed by Cash, the prisoner took from his person 'the knife, not possessed byJiim for any unlawful purpose, but used in the work in which he had heen engaged, and immediately stabs the deceased. The use of the deadly weapon and the thrust at the vital part would warrant the conclusion that the prisoner intended to take life, and therefore that the act was premeditated. But there is nothing to show deliberation, but on the contrary, the facts of the transaction negative that conclusion.
As we have said, there is a substantial difference between premeditation, and deliberationâ€”a difference more readily appreciated than to be accurately defined. An apt statement is. to be found in the opinion of Judge Daniels in People v. Leighton, speaking of the elements necessary to constitute murder in the first degree, he says: â€?The- execution of the guilty purpose is required to be settled and determined upon reflection, before the crime of murder in the first degree can be committed. A full and determined purpose is rendered necessary as distinguished from a mere impulsive fatal act.â€?Â¡No particular period of time is requisite for the deliberation, but still deliberation must take place. We do not say that in no supposable case could deliberation be consummated in so brief a period as that occupied by the broil in which this crime was committed; but we do say that in this case there is nothing to show deliberation, but rather a passionate, vicious impulse. ' The result of these views is that the prisoner obtains practical immunity for his crime; for being a prisoner for life nothing, save a capital execution can increase his punishment. We can not but think that this consideration affected the verdict.' But the law recognizes no distinction between one in the condition of this prisoner and a free person. If it be necessary for the purposes of prison discipline, or to protect the lives, whether of keepers or convicts, that offenses committed by prisoners shall be punished more severely than those committed by others the remedy is with the legislature. The courts must carry out the law as they find it, and not strain it to punish even the greatest of offenders.

1164425,PEOPLE ex rel. SHERWIN v. MEAD,1883-05,"Finch, J.
The application for the relatorâ€™s discharge from arrest was properly denied.
1. The statement of the offense charged contained in the warrant was sufficient. That commanded the officer to â€?take Frank It. Sherwin, who stands indicted in the Court of Sessions of the County of Albany for contempt.â€?It was issued after indictment found (2 R. S. p. 728, Â§ 55), and by the district attorney, who was duly authorized to issue it (2 Laws of 1847, p. 444); and sufficiently specified the offense charged in the .indictment. That was for â€?contempt.â€?While it is true that an act or omission may be in the nature of a contempt and properly described as such, without constituting a crime, yet it is also true that a contempt may be such as to fall within the criminal law and subject the offender to indictment. The statement in the warrant was of a contempt which had already served as the basis of an indictment and necessarily implied a willful contempt, and of a character which constituted a misdemeanor. The person arrested could not be misled by it, and was fairly apprised of the nature of the pending accusation. A warrant issued after indictment found may briefly state the offense, and need not be more precise and accurate than is sufficient to apprise the prisoner of the charge against him. Pratt v. Bogardus, 49 Barb. 92. The Code of Criminal Procedure does not apply (Â§ 962); nor is this a case of commitment for contempt within 2. R. S. 567, Â§ 40.
2. It was not necessary to the validity of the indictment that the accused should first have been adjudged in contempt by the court whose process he disobeyed. The two proceedings are wholly independent of each other. One who disobeys the lawful order of a court not only offends against the dignity of the particular tribunal, but also against the public law. The particular court may pass over the contempt and suffer its order to be spurned, but the offense against the People remains. Their authority * has been contemned, the administration of public justice assailed, and its power despised.- For such an offense the guilty party may be punished by indictment, although the court, whose order has been disobeyed, may take the indignity in silence. The statute has made such disobedience, when willful in its character, an offense against the people, and not left it dependent upon the action or non-action of the specific judge or court. The statute contemplates that both remedies or either may be pursued. If the court has first moved and proceeded against the offender by attachment and inflicted punishment, he may nevertheless be indicted for the same wrong, but in that event the sentence is to be affected by the previous punishment. 3 R. S. [6th ed.] p. 442, Â§ 14. We have considered the argument very elaborately stated, founded upon the phrase in the criminal statute, â€?every person who shall be guilty of a criminal contempt,â€?and construing the word â€œguiltyâ€?to mean adjudged guilty by the court whose process has been disobeyed, without being convinced by it. We have no doubt that the language means guilty in fact of the willful disobedience which constitutes a criminal contempt, although not so adjudged by the court whose process has been disregarded.
3. It is said the offense was not committed in the county of Albany. The relator was served with a subpoena requiring him to appear before the court of Oyer and Terminer at Albany. He did not so appear. The disobedience and the contempt were there and could be nowhere else. The order, if obeyed, was to be obeyed in Albany, and, if disobeyed, could only be disobeyed there. The witness was called in Albany and omitted to appear and answer in Albany. We have no doubt that the offense for which he was indicted was committed there; if, indeed, it shall be shown upon the trial that any offense was committed at all.
4. There was no error in refusing to take bail when the application was made. At that time the Albany Oyer and Terminer was in session, and in such case the Justice of the Supreme Court to whom the application was made in Eew York had no power to let the prisoner to bail. 2 R. S. 728, Â§Â§, 56, 57. The Albany Oyer and Terminer had authority to try the prisoner although the indictment was found in the Com-t of Sessions. 2 R. R. 205, Â§Â§ 29, 30. The -very object of bail is to cover an interval before the session of the next court at which the trial can be had. It takes the place of the imprisonment during such interval. When, therefore, there is no such interval, and the court being in session the presence of the prisoner is due at once, there is no necessary occasion or proper cause for bail, unless by the court sitting, and the statute therefore devised the authority in such event to any tribunal except the court in session, before which the indictment was triable. People v. Clews, 77 N. Y. 39. There is no difficulty in harmonizing the provisions of title 2 and title 4. The first relates to arrest before indictment found, and the last to the indictment and proceedings thereafter. The whole subject was considered in the Clews case, and its argument does not need to be repeated.
Some other objections have been considered but do not require discussion.
The order of the General Term should be affirmed, and it should be â€?ordered and adjudged that said Frank E. Sherwin, appear at the next General Term of the Supreme Court, to be held in the first judicial department, on the .first day of said General Term, at the opening of said General Term, or as soon thereafter as counsel can be heard, and on such other days or times as may be fixed by it, and abide by and perform its judgment or order in the premises.â€?All concur.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164451,PEOPLE v. FITZPATRICK,1883-09,"Boardman, J.
The defendant had been held to await the action of the grand jury to convene at May Term, 1883, of the Albany Oyer and Terminer. Before the grand jurors were sworn in, the defendant, by counsel, appeared, and filed a paper-containing certain objections to the grand jury, and prayed the court to discharge them. The district attorney apposed this application. It was thereupon consented by both parties that the motion should stand over, without prejudice to defendantâ€™s rights, or to the right and duty of the court. That if an indictment should be found the objection should be considered and determined with the same force and effect as if decided prior to the organization of the grand jury.
The grand jury, then organized, found an indictment against the defendant. About.three months thereafter, an order- was made in' said Oyer and Terminer that, as to said defendant, the body impaneled as a grand jury be set aside and discharged, as of the date of the first presentation of the objections ; that the said indictment against the defendant be not received, and stand as quashed ; that such'order was to take effect as of May 7th; that nothing therein was to affect the action of said grand jurors as to persons not having made such objections.
From this order the people appeal; and counsel on each side desire that the case may bÃ© considered and disposed of on the main question 'rather then upon any technical ground which does not dispose of the merits.
In the first place, there is an obvious inconsistency in the order. A grand jury can not be discharged as to some of the persons indicted and remain as to the others. If discharged"" as to some, it must be discharged as to all. Otherwise there would, or might be, two grand juries at the same time, because -the section which provides for discharging a grand jury requires the summoning of another. Code Crim. Pro. 238.
Again, it is obvious that when a body of men, sworn and impaneled, as a grand jury, aS such have found indictment, they may be discharged as having finished their labors. But they cannot be discharged retroactively, as is attempted in this order, so that the order shall take effect as of a date prior to their action as a grand jury.
Undoubtedly the indictments found by them may, for good cause, be quashed. But that is a very different matter. Uo order of the court takeÃ± subsequent to the finding of the indictment can alter the fact that a body of men summoned as a grand jury were not discharged, but acted as .such, and found the indictment.
But counsel on both sides express the wish that this appeal should be considered as if the order had, in fact, been made on , the 7th of May. And, therefore, we pass over the inconsistencies above mentioned. Still they seem,to have occurred to the learned justice, because the order not only discharges the grand jury nunc pro tunc, which could not have been done, but it also quashes or sets aside the indictment; and thus we have the further difficulty, that an order, which is to take effect May 7, quashes or sets aside an indictment which had not then been found. That is, it quashes it in advance.
The learned justice well expresses in his opinion the doubt as to what the order should be.
Let us next inquire whether the order was proper so far as it quashed the indictment. The objections raised are precisely those urged in the Petrea case, 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 198-233; 28 Hun, 140. It was in that case held by the Court of Appeals, affirming the decision of this court and of the Court of Sessions, that, where an indictment had been found by a grand jury, drawn under this very law and in the very manner now in question, it should not be quashed on the defendantâ€™s motion. It cannot be necessary or proper to argue that question again. Whatever else may have been said in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, that principle was absolutely decided, and such decision should govern. The Oyer and Terminer, then, should not in this case have quashed the indictment. We think the learned justice must have seen that his decision in this respect was contrary to the law of the Petrea case. For a large part of his opinion is made up of citations of authorities, principally from other states, tending to show that the decision of the Court of Appeals is wrong, and that an indictment found by a grand jury selected under an unconstitutional law, should be quashed on the defendantâ€™s motion.
It is suggested, however, that although an indictment, after it is found, ought not to be quashed upon the ground urged in the Petrea case, yet, if these grounds were presented to the court before the indictment was found as a reason for quashing it after it should be found, then, the decision in the Petrea case would not apply, and the indictment should be quashed. But this cannot be. That decision held that no constitutional right of the defendant was invaded by holding him to answer under the indictment, although the same facts appear there as appear here. An indictment cannot be quashed before it is found. After it is found the facts now alleged present no reason for quashing it, as was decided in the Petrea case. Hence the same facts can never be a ground for quashing an indictment; because, until an indictment shall be found, a motion to quash cannot be made. But, again, this order discharges the grand jury, dr the body so called, and by agreement of counsel we are to consider the order as if it had been made May 7.
The first objection to this part of the order which is obvious is that just stated, viz : That on a motion by a person held to trial, the court assumed to discharge the grand jury as to him, and allow it to stand as to others. How could such an order be properly made at the opening of the court, or at any other time? Would the court on May 7, have summoned another, especially for this defendant? Would the court have charged the one grand jury to inquire as to all crimes except those oÃ­ Thomas Fitzpatrick, and the other to inquire as to his only ? It is plain that even when we treat this order as one made at the opening of the court, it is inconsistent with itself. Again, there are more serious objections. This paper filed by the defendant, call it by any name he may please, is really, in effect, a challenge to the array. This is a well known term, which calls for no definition. Similar objections were defined to be a challenge in the Petrea case. 28 Hun, 440 ; 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 198-233.
Now section 238 of the Code of Criminal Procedure forbids any challenge to the panel or to the array of a grand jury. The counsel for the defendant urges that this section does not prevent objections made before the grand jury is impaneled. But a challenge is an objection made to the swearing in and impaneling of the grand jury, not an objection made after they are sworn in and impaneled. Such has been the ordinary meaning of the word, and in that sense the legislature must have used it when it forbade challenges to the panel or array. It would be trifling to enact a section which meant that challenges to the panel or array could not be made after a grand jury was sworn in and impaneled, but might be made before.
The learned justice, however, takes another view, and thinks that the challenges to the panel or array, which are forbidden by this section, are challenges to a legal panel or array of grand jurors, and not challenges to an illegal panel. One would suppose there was not much necessity to prohibit challenges to the. panel or array of a legal grand jury. The section means just what it says. That is, that challenges or objections to the panel or array of the grand jury can no longer be taken. It was evidently thought that as the grand jury was only an accusing body it was unnecessary to give an accused person the right to make objections to the details of its selection.
If the code had not forbidden challenges of this kind, still, / under the decision of the Petrea case we do not sec how this could be allowed. If the law in question were unconstitutional this could not be asserted by a party whose rights it did not affect. Cooley Const. Lim. 163 ; People v. Brooklyn, Platbush & Coney Island R. R. Co., 89 N. Y. 75, per Finch, J. ; Pierrepont v. Loveless, 72 N. Y. 211. And the decision in the Petrea case was that the defendantâ€™s constitutional rights were not invaded by holding him to answer the indictment, and therefore not invaded by the mode of selecting the grand jury. Friery v. People, 2 Keyes, 425.
The learned judge, however, places this order on another ground. Section 238, above cited, after forbidding challenges, provides that the court may, in its discretion, discharge the grand jury and order a new one to be summoned for any of several causes ; among them, â€?that the requisite number of ballots was not drawn from the grand jury box of the county.â€?We can hardly understand how the order appealed from could have been made in the exercise of that discretion. Because the learned justice says in his opinion that â€?whenever it plainly appears that every safeguard of law in the selection of grand jurors has been disregarded,â€?&c. (that is, by the enactment of the very excellent chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881), then it was a wise exercise of discretion to set aside the supposed panel and to order a new panel to be summoned. How, if this were so, the same wise discretion would seem to require that other indicted persons should be protected as well as this defendant. And it would seem an unwise exercise of discretion to grant as a special favor to this defendant the safeguard to which others were equally entitled. Yet the order, in the discretion of the court, withholds from those who have not made the objections â€?the guaranties which the constitution gives to every citizen for his protection.â€?It may be remarked in passing, that while in the opinion of the Court of Appeals in the Petrea case the act in question was spoken of as unconstitutional, yet it was distinctly held that the question of constitutionality could not be raised by the defendant in that case. As it could not be raised by him, it could not in that case be decided by the court. As is said by Judge Finch in People v. Brooklyn, Flatbysk & Coney Island TÃ­. It. Co. (89 N. Y. 92), â€?it is our duty to decide a constitutional question only when it is directly and necessarily involved in the issue to be determined.â€?Whatever was said as to the unconstitutionality of the law was obiter, that is, it was not involved in the decision, and only served to encourage further efforts to thwart the criminal law.
Was, then, the discretion proper which was thus exercised by the court of Oyer and Terminer in favor of Fitzpatrick, and refused as to other accused persons ?
The Court of Appeals had held that such a grand jury was competent to find valid indictments. â–?Why, then, should the court of Oyer and Terminer set aside- this competent, jury ? The requisite number of ballots had been drawn. These ballots had been drawn from the only box and list of jurors made up in the county from which to draw grand jurors. This box and this list were in fact the grand jury box and list. It was plainly immaterial what the box was called. It held, in fact, the names selected under color of law as gjâ€™and jurors. And there was no other box or list from which grand jurors could be drawn. This box and this list were to such extent the box and list from which to draw grand jurors, and it had been held by the Court.of Appeals that a grand jury drawn therefrom was a valid grand jury. For what possible reason or under what discretion, then, should a grand jury so drawn be set aside? Not the least objection was made to the competency or qualification of any or all of them. If the learned justice had refused to set the jury aside, the indictments found by them would have been valid and the administration of the criminal law would not have been obstructed by an objection without any real merit. We think it was not a wise exercise of discretion to set aside a body of unexceptionable men, whose competency to find indictments had been established by the Court of Appeals.
It seems to us the error which underlies nearly all of the reasoning of the learned justice in his opinion is,. that he assumes that any man may set up the unconstitutionality of a law,â€?although it does not affect his rights or subject him to any wrong. This is carried a step further in assuming that it is a wise discretion to set aside a body of competent officers against the mode of selection of whom, even if it be illegal, no one has the right to set up any objection.
Ho objection is made by the defendant to the right of the People to appeal from the order, and so that subject is not considered.
The order appealed from should be reversed.
Learned, P. J., concurs.
Bockes, J.
I think the order should be reversed. It was, 1 as I think, improper to quash or set aside the panel as to Fitzpatrick, yet in effect hold it good as to all other persons charged with crime who omitted to interpose objections, inasmuch. as the objections raised a question of jurisdiction. If the panel was without jurisdiction as to Fitzpatrickâ€™s case, it was equally without jurisdiction as to all others similarly charged.
But we are asked to consider the case on the merits, just as it was examined in the court of Oyer and Terminer, to raise the validity of the objection urged against the panel by Fitzpatrick, as regards the mode of drawing, summoning and impaneling the grand jury. This question is, I think, settled against Fitzpatrick by this court, and by the Court of Appeals, in the Petrea case.
It was held in that case that the objections here urged in Fitzpatrickâ€™s behalf could not be maintained by one charged with a criminal offense, further than to see that the action or proceeding challenged as irregular and void was taken"" under the color of lawful authority / and, as was said in the case cited it would not alter the case even if such action involved some proceeding of an officer or of officers taken under an unconstitutional law; the.court would still retain this jurisdiction over the matter and the proceedings. The authorities upholding this conclusion are cited in Petreaâ€™s case, as well in this court as in the Court of Appeals. It was said in the latter court, in answer to the objections here urged, that an indictment found by a body drawn, summoned and sworn as a grand jury, before a competent court, and composed of good and lawful men, fulfill the constitutional guaranty that a jury so formed was a de facto jury, because selected and organized under the forms of law; that a defect in its constitution, owing to the invalidity of a law under which a panel was drawn, affected no substantial right of one charged with crime ; hence an objection based thereon was not available to him. So it was held â€?that an indictment found by a grand jury of good and lawful men, selected and drawn under color of law, was a good indictment by a grand jury within the sense of the constitution, although the law under which the selection was made was void.â€?It would seem to follow that if an indictment, when found, would be good and valid, it could hardly be maintained that the grand jury which found it acted without jurisdiction or authority in the premises. I am of the opinion that the decision in the Petrea case determines all questions presented on this appeal against the objections urged in the Oyer and Terminer in Fitzpatrickâ€™s behalf. It follows that the order appealed from should be reversed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164492,PEOPLE v. McTAMENEY,1883-09,"Learned, P. J.
The Penal Code, section 528, defines larceny ; sections 530 and 531 define grand larceny in the first and second degrees; and section 532 declares every other larceny to be petit larceny. The prisoner was indicted for grand larceny and was convicted of petit larceny. We think that this was proper under sections. 444 and 445 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The offense of which he was convicted was of a degree inferior to that of which he was indicted. And we do not think that section 56 of that same Code is to be construed to take from a jury in the Courts of Oyer and Terminer and of the Sessions the power to find a verdict of petit larceny when the prisoner has been indicted for grand larceny, and is on trial before them for that crime. If such construction were to be given to that section, and if such a jury should be obliged to acquit in case they were satisfied the stolen property was not of the value of more than $25, probably the prisoner could not thereafter be tried for such stealing.
The next question is as to the length of the sentence.
The sections of the Penal Code above cited are intended to take the place of 2 R. S. (m. p.) 679, section 63, and 690, section 1. Section 535 declares that petit larceny is a misdemeanor, meaning petit larceny as in that Code defined. Section 719 declares that an offense specified in the Code committed after, etc., must be punished according to the provisions of that Code. Section 15 declares the punishment of misdemeanors to be imprisonment for not more than a year, or a fine of $500, or both, unless some other punishment is specially prescribed by the Code or by some other statutory provision. Ho other punishment is specially prescribed by the Code for petit larceny, and none by any other statute, unless 2 R. S. (m. p.), 690, section 1, be in force.
The Penal Code is a general statute intended to define nearly all offenses, and to prescribe the punishment. Section 726 repeals all inconsistent acts so far as they impose any punishment for crime. The penalty imposed by the section of the Revised Statutes above cited is certainly inconsistent with that imposed by the Code. It cannot be understood that the exception made in-section 15 of the Penal Code was to take away the effect of section 726.
The argument of the prisoner is that whenever a punishment had been prescribed for a misdemeanor previously to the Penal Code, which was not in express and specific language repealed, that punishment remains in force.
How if we turn to 2 R. S. (m. p.) 697, section 40, we find a provision for the punishment of all misdemeanors of which the punishment is not prescribed by some other statute. Therefore, according to the argument of the prisoner, a punishment is especially prescribed for every misdemeanor, and therefore every misdemeanor is excepted from section 15 of the Penal Code. This is plainly unreasonable.
Again, the definitions of larceny in the Penal Code arc not identical (in language) with those in the Revised Statutes. Therefore, that part of section 1, 2 R. S. (in. p.) 690, which defines petit larceny is not in force. Why, then, the residue of the section'{
The prisonerâ€™s position, if correct, would apply apparently to other cases of misdemeanors. For instance, section 651 of the Penal Code declares certain interference with gas-pipes to be a misdemeanor, but prescribes no penalty. This section is substantially the Act of 1854, cli. 109, sections 1 and 2, by which the crime was declared and a penalty prescribed, of six months imprisonment and a fine of two hundred and fifty dollars. Arc we to understand, then, that a violation of section 651 of the Penal Code is not punishable under section 15 of the samo Code, but that the penalty prescribed in the act of 1854 is in force ?
Under such a construction the Penal Code would cease to be a complete system, as it was intended to be. Section 7.
The judgment and conviction should be affirmed.

1164453,PEOPLE v. TRUMBLE,1883-01,"Bockes, J.
We are confronted in this case, in the outset, , with the question whether the defendant had the right of appeal, under the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, from the judgment rendered by the police justice to the Court of Sessions of Fulton County.
The defendant was convicted and sentenced under sections 42 and 43 of the act entitled, â€?An act to reorganize the village of Gloversville,â€?in the county of Fulton. L. 1873, ch. 505, pp. 712, 785, 786. The offense of which the defendant was convicted was the selling of intoxicating liquors, to wit: lager beer, in quantities less than five gallons, without license. By the sections above cited, such offenders are declared â€?disorderly persons,â€?and provision is there made for their summary trial and punishment, by and before the Police Justice of the village. The proceeding in this case was.taken before that officer, not acting as a Court of Special Sessions but as Police Justice under the authority conferred on him by the provisions of the village charter above cited. The record shows that the defendant was convicted of the offense charged, and that he was sentenced to confinement in the county jail for the period of thirty days. An appeal was taken from such conviction and judgment to the Court of Sessions of the county pursuant to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, good in form in all respects, as an appeal from a judgment upon conviction rendered by a court of Special Sessions. Sections 749 et seq.
A motion was made in the Court of Sessions to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was unauthorized by law. The motion was denied and the denial was entered in the final judgment of affirmance rendered by that court on the appeal. From such judgment of affirmance an appeal was taken to this court. It is again urged that the appeal to the Court of Sessions from the judgment of the police justice was without authority of law inasmuch as he acted as an officer merely under special authority conferred by the village charter, not as a Court of Special Sessions, and that in such cases the right of appeal to the Court of Sessions is not given by the Code, or otherwise.
If the point be well taken that the appeal was unauthorized, the Court of Sessions should have granted the motion to dismiss, as in that case the court was without jurisdiction to hear the case on the merits, and it would follow that this court should reverse the judgment of affirmance rendered by that court, and do what that court should have done, dismiss the original appeal from the judgment rendered by the police justice.
The result would be to leave the convictions and judgment by the Police Justice in full force and effect. That result must follow if the original appeal to the Sessions was without authority of law.
The right of appeal exists only when expressly conferred by-statute ; hence there could be no appeal to the Sessions from the judgment of the police justice in the case, unless given by law.
It is claimed that such right is conferred by section 749 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides for appeals from judgments rendered by a Court of Special Sessions. We are cited to no other express provision, nor are we aware of any, under which the appeal in this case can be upheld ; and the question is whether it comes within the purview of that section. We have held at this term, in the People v. Burleigh, that where authority is conferred upon a particular officer or magistrate, giving to him special jurisdiction in a criminal matter, with special directions as to the mode of procedure, he must be deemed to actas an officer, and not as a Court of Special Sessions.
In addition to what was said in the case cited, it should be noticed that a distinction is marked between Courts of Special Sessions and courts authorized to be held by police justices under special provisions of law, both in the constitution and laws of the State; and particularly is the distinction marked in the Code of Criminal Procedure, in numerous instances; indeed, the distinction runs through all its provisions having reference to those courts. They are treated as separate and distinct courts, and are always spoken of in contradistinction. But it is urged that the right of appeal from judgments rendered by police justices was intended to be conferred by section 749, because part Y. of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which embraces that section, is defined by section 2 to relate to proceedings in Special Sessions and Police Courts. But such relation is answered by the separate provisions relative to those courts respectively contained in part Y. Section 699 was amended in 1882, in order to have it expressed that such section should apply to both courts, which it did not do prior to the amendment.
Title III. of part Y. is entitled: â€?of appeals from Courts of Special Sessions and then follows section 749, which gives the right of appeal from judgments upon conviction rendered by Courts of Special Sessions, but not from judgments rendered by Police Courts. We are referred to section 767, where it is provided that if the judgment be reversed, and the defendant be imprisoned in pursuance of the judgment of the Police Court, the Court of Sessions must order him to be discharged; but this provision does not aid the case, inasmuch as section 74, as amended in 1882, declares that â€?Courts held by police justices are called Police Courts, and Courts of Special Sessions are also called Police Courts, and are so designated in different parts of the Code.â€?We find no provision declaring that Police Courts, ex vi termini, are to be held and deemed Courts of Special Sessions.
In conclusion, then, we find no authority for the appeal in this case from the judgment rendered by the Police Justice to the Court of Sessions. The appeal is not given by the charter of the village of Gloversville ; nor by any special statute; nor by any provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure, general or special.
Provision is made by the Code for the review of convictions of disorderly persons (Â§ 39, subd. 6, title VII. of part VI., entitled â€œof proceedings respecting disorderly personsâ€?in certain cases ; but these provisions do not touch the question of the right of appeal in this case.
Our conclusion is that the appeal to the Sessions was without authority of law, hence that the judgment of affirmance by that court was without jurisdiction. An appeal to this court from that judgment is however given by section 770. Thus, the proceeding is before this court for the purpose of correcting the record.

1164454,SINDRAM v. PEOPLE,1882-01,"Davis, P. J.
On the trial of the indictment against him, the plaintiff in error was convicted of murder in the first degree, and sentenced to be executed on the 10th day of February, 1882. Ho stay of proceedings has been granted in his case, and it is therefore important that it be promptly considered and determined by this court. We have given it the careful consideration that its grave character demands; and have reached the conclusion that no error was committed upon the trial that requires us to interfere with the judgment. The principal question presented by the bill of exceptions arises upon the exclusion of evidence offered on the part of the plaintiff in error. Insanity of the accused was not averred nor claimed upon the trial. It was in effect conceded that at the time of the commission of the act the accused was sane within the established rules of legal responsibility. Ho evidence was offered on his behalf with intent to show the contrary, but after the people had rested their case, and had given evidence tending to show that the killing was with deliberate and premeditated design to effect the death of the deceased, and therefore murder in the first degree, a witness, on behalf of the defense, who had known the accused for several years, was asked this question: â€œWas your attention ever called to any peculiarities or eccentricities in his conduct?â€?The prosecuting attorney called upon counsel to state the object of this .question, and the counsel for the defense then stated in substance that the object was' to aid the jury in passing upon the question â€?of the forming of a premeditated and deliberate design to effect the death of the deceased, by giving the jury such information of the history, antecedents and peculiarities and characteristics of the defendant as will assist them in coming to a conclusion â€?.....â€?whether the act was the result of impulse and anger, or a premeditated' and deliberate design to effect death.â€?After considerable discussion by the respective counsel, the court excluded the evidence, and an exception was duly taken.
The counsel for the defense then made the following offer: â€?I offer to prove by a number of .witnesses in court that for a number of years past the prisoner has been characterized by peculiarities and eccentricities of conduct which have caused criticism with reference to his capacity mentally; and also that he is a person who has been known to be the victim of inordinate passion; giving expression to it in various ways, and at various times. We offer rhisâ€™for the purpose of enabling the jury to consider the character, the mental condition, of the defendant prior to and in view of the circumstances of this killing, in order that they may be enabled to pass upon the grade of homicide, either as murder in the first or second degree, or manslaughter in the third degree.â€?And after some colloquy between the court and counsel on both sides, the counsel for the defense added : â€?It is offered, as bearing on the quality of the act, whether murder in first or second degree, and also upon the question whether this killing does not amount, in view of the evidence, and the history we propose to show, to manslaughter in the third degree;â€?to which the court said: â€œI understand it is offered as bearing upon the question of intent and deliberation and premeditation, but at the same time not amounting to insanitytherefore the offer is rejected.â€?The counsel for the defense again excepted. At the time those offers were made and rejected no evidence had been given to show the circumstances of the killing of the deceased, except that on the part of the people ; nor was any subsequently given by or on the part of the accused tending to contradict or affect the testimony of the two witnesses who were present and saw the act of homicide. Whatever there is in the case tending to establish a different version as to what took place at that time was brought into the case by the proof and production, after the defense had rested, of the letters of the accused written while he was in prison awaiting the result of his act, and after the result had led to his indictment of murder. The rulings of the court show that it was supposed that the evidence offered was to some extent mixed up with a question of insanity. The evidence would undoubtedly have been received if insanity had been asserted, for it might have had a legitimate effect in its bearing upon that condition. But the idea of establishing insanity by the evidence offered was distinctly repudiated by the counsel. He put the offer upon the precise ground of the bearing of the evidence upon the degree of. the guilt of the accused. In that question insanity had and could have no place whatever, for there can be no such thing in law as a grade of insanity that changes the .crime of homicide from one degree to another. Insanity excludes the idea of guilt. Ho man can in law be insane as to an act of murder in the first degree, and sane to the same act as murder in the second degree. Hence it was entirely right to exclude the evidence in so far as it was supposed to be offered upon any such hypothesis. But it is quite another thing when such evidence is offered, in a proper case, to show the absence of a deliberate and premeditated degign to effect death, which our statute requires to constitute the crime of murder in the first degree. The statute was designed to define and simplify the distinction between the two degrees of murder, so that courts and juries might make no mistake in its application. The first requires the killing to be with a deliberate and premeditated design to effect death. The second requires a felonious intention to kill, without such deliberate and premeditated design. These degrees are made for the purpose of affixing the penaltiesâ€”to the former, death; to the latter, imprisonment for life. They present upon a trial the consider- . ation of the most solemn questions of fact that can be given to a jury. They are questions, too, of mental operation which cannot be discerned by looking into the mind and observing its actual workings, but only by a process of convinced reasoning based upon established facts, which lead the minds of the jury to see in the mind of the accused the required'condition which accompanied and caused the criminal act. Hence it is of importance in such cases that a jury shall know, so far as. practicable, the character of the mind with which they are called upon to deal. The law recognizes, in all the various degrees of criminal homicide, not only gradations of mental operations and intentions, but the strength as well as the weakness of human passions and human nature; not to excuse from crime, but to denote and adjust the suitable punishment. To killing with deliberate and premeditated design it awards death; to killing with mere felonious intention, imprisonment for life; to killing without intention, in the heat of passion, with a deadly weapon, by gross negligence, or in any of the other modes defined by the statute, it accords punishment ranging from long terms of imprisonment, down to the lightest sentence that courts can pronounce. The spirit and philosophy of our law of homicide cannot be carried into just effect without careful inquiry on the part of juries into the mental condition and operations of the accused party at the time his alleged offense was committed ; and this requires a reasonable range of inquiry into the nature and character of the mind charged with a felonious intent. It would have been no error, therefore, in our judgment, to have admitted the offered evidence, or such portions as bore reasonable proximity to the crime.
But there must be a reasonable discretion in a trial court, in such cases, to restrict and control such evidence, and to exclude it when it is not entitled to any legitimate effect upon the question of the mental condition of the accused at the time of committing the act. In this case the evidence on the part of the people showed in substance that the accused, after having been excluded from the room he had previously occupied, by the direction of the deceased, returned the following morning at half-past ten, armed with a revolver, all the barrels of which (four in number) were loaded, and entered the house of the deceased by means of his pass-key. While standing in the hall he was asked by the deceased what he wanted there, to which he answered that he wished to see her mother (the deceased). The daughter asked, â€?What for ?â€?and his answer was, â€?Hever mind ; I want to see your mother.â€?The deceased was returning from the attic of the house, and. hearing this conversation, called down to her daughter, saying, â€?Who is there ? â€?The daughter answered, â€?It is that Willie Sindram.â€?â€?What does he want in the house now ? he has no right in the house now,â€?said the deceased. The prisoner said, in a cross and angry tone, â€?Come down here, and I will show you what I want!â€?The daughter then started to go up the stairs, and the deceased had reached the landing above. The prisoner drew his pistol from his pocket, and held it down by his side. The daughter saw the pistol, and cried out to the deceased, â€?Mother, run ! he has a pistol! he is going to kill you !â€?The deceased ran from the landing, and the prisoner, pushing the daughter aside, ran up the stairs, and as the deceased was raising a window, crying â€?Murder! police! help! â€?he extended his aim and fired at her. When the deceased heard the shot she left the window and crouched down in the corner of the hall, and the prisoner went up to her, and putting the pistol within three inches of her head, fired the fatal shot of which she afterward died. He then ran down stairs with the pistol in his hand, and out of the house, and fled. This is substantially the testimony of the two witnesses who saw the transaction. One of them (the daughter) said he looked very angry ; the other, a woman who lived on the floor where the shooting occurred, said the prisoner acted coolly. Nothing occurred between the deceased and the accused on that morning which could have awakened any sudden anger. They had not seen each other on the night before, when he left the house. One of the persons present in the room testified that he said he would return in the morning and make a â€?bloody row.â€?The other witness then present testified that he did not hear any such threat. But it is clear, upon the testimony, that he came back to the house armed for an evil purpose ; that he drew his pistol and held it concealed by his side ; that when he saw the deceased was not- coming down he rushed up the stairs and fired as she was seeking to give the alarm; and then, as she crouched in fear, he deliberately wralked up to her and shot her in the head, under circumstances where it was impossible to miss his aim; and then, as she fell, fled from the house. His whole conduct showed a deliberate plan to shoot the deceased. Nothing occurred at that time to arouse sudden passion. His anger was kept in restraint for the purpose of revenge. There could have been no legitimate connection with the eccentricities and peculiarities or passions, which it was offered to show had been .exhibited years before, and on previous occasions of his life ; for proving them could not have shown that he was acting otherwise than with the cool, deliberate purpose with which he carried out his design. To exclude the offer under such circumstances was not error. Nor would the admission of the evidence have been of the slightest benefit to the accused. Nothing was offered in immediate connection with his act; and when that was shown to be a carefully conducted act of revenge, it was a proper exercise of discretion to exclude the offer made on his behalf. We are of opinion, therefore, that no error was committed in the rulings excepted to. We have examined with care all the exceptions taken to the charge, and are of opinion that none of them was well taken. If there were any just grounds of criticism to the charge as first given, the court carefully corrected them when attention was called to them by the counsel for the prisoner. The court also charged in accordance with a large number of requests made by the counsel, and in so doing presented with clearness and precision the several questions to be considered by the jury, and the rules and principles of law by which the jury were to be governed. We are not able to see that any error was committed upon the trial which requires any interference with the verdict and judgment. The conviction and judgment must therefore be affirmed.

1164469,McKEON v. PEOPLE,1883-01,"Haight, J.
The plaintiff in error was indicted in May, 1880, and tried and convicted on Hovember 19, 1881. The Code of Criminal Procedure went into effect September 1, 1881.
Section 515 of the Code provides that â€?writs of error and of certiorari in criminal actions, as they have heretofore existed, are abolished, and hereafter the mode of reviewing a judgment or order in a criminal action is by appeal.â€?Section 962 provides that â€œthis Code applies to criminal actions, and all other proceedings in criminal cases, which are herein provided for from the time when it .takes effect; but all such actions and proceedings theretofore commenced must be. conducted in the same manner as if this Code had not been passed.â€?The plaintiff in error contends that inasmuch as the indictment was found prior to the Codeâ€™s going into effect, the action- and review by writ of error must be conducted in the same manner as if the Code had not been passed. This we do- not understand to be correct.
The suing out of a certiorari or writ of error is the commencement of a new action or proceeding, and is not the continuance of the old one. Femu v. Dickinson, 4 Den. 84-5; Gormley v. McIntosh, 22 Barb. 271-3, and authorities there cited; see, also, Matter of the will of Gates, 26 Hun, 179.
By section 515 these writs were abolished. Under section 962, where writs are sued out before the Code went into effect, the proceedings thereunder would be conducted in the same manner as if the Code had not been passed. This writ, however, was sued out after the Code went into' effect. It was the commencement of a new action or proceeding, and is therefore not brought within the saving clause of section 962.
The Criminal Code having recently gone into effect, the practice is new. The district attorney should have moved seasonably to have had the writ- quashed ; failing to do so, he may now properly be regarded as having waived theâ€?defect.
Upon the trial the people gave evidence tending to prove that the defendant was admitted to bail, and that he failed to appear for trial at the October Court of Sessions, in 1881; that during the session of the court he was about the streets of Bradford, Pennsylvania, in a condition to come to Warsaw, the place where the court was held. Upon the defense, the defendantâ€™s counsel offered to show by the defendant that during the term of court the defendant was seriously ill, and that â€?Dr. Bay stated to him at that time that it would endanger his life to leave his room and come down here,â€?meaning Warsaw, the place of trial. This was- objected to, the objection was sustained, and exception taken by the defendantâ€™s counsel. Witness also testified that he was advised that the court at which he was to be tried, and which he did not attend, had been adjourned. The question was then asked, â€?Were you requested to be at the adjourned term?â€?This was objected to, the objection sustained, and exception taken by the defendant. He was also asked the question, â€œDid you also communicate information that you would be here on that day ?â€?meaning the adjourned day. This was objected to, objection sustained, and exception taken by the defendant.
Also the question, â€?Had you made arrangements for the expenses of your trial and your witnesses on that day ? â€?Objected to, sustained, and exception by the defendant.
These rulings, we think, were erroneous. The people having given evidence showing his non-appearance at the court, to which he had given bail, and at which he was required to attend for trial, it doubtless led the jury to infer that he was afraid to submit to a trial upon the merits.
It was therefore, proper for him to show the reasons for his non-attendance, and, if he had heen required to attend at the adjourned term, his good faith in preparing for trial at such adjourned term. If he were, in fact, prevented by sickness, it would entirely rebut any inference of guilt, or of fear to submit to a trial.
We are of the opinion that the judgment and conviction must be reversed, and the proceedings remitted to the Court of Sessions of Wyoming County, for a new trial in that court.

1164500,PEOPLE v. NOBLES,1883-04,"The statute is: as follows :
Â§ 1. No' person, company or corporation shall manufacture or have in this State, or deal in, sell or give away, for illuminating or heating purposes in lamps or stoves within the State, oil or burning fluid, whether the same be composed wholly or in part of naptha, coal oil, petroleum or products manufactured therefrom, or of other substances or materials, which shall emit an inflammable vapor, which will flash at a temperature below one hundred degrees by the Fahrenheit thermometer, according to the instrument and methods approved by the State Board of Health of Hew York.
*******
Â§ 3. It shall be the duty of the State Board of Health of Hew Y ork to recommend and direct the nature of the test and instruments by which the illuminating oil, as hereinbefore described, shall be tested in accordance with this act. It shall be the duty of the public analysts, who may now be employed by the State Board of Health, or who may be hereafter appointed, to test such samples as may be submitted to them, under the rules to be adopted by the said board, for which service the said board shall provide reasonable compensation; at the first quarterly meeting of the State Board of Health held after the passage of this'act, it shall adopt such measures as may seem necessary to facilitate the enforcement of this act. .
Section 4 excepts from the above, in certain cases, naphtha and other light products of petroleum.
The evidence on behalf of the prosecution showed that defendant, a dealer in oils, had at divers times sold to one Delano, a retail grocer, in the course of his business, kerosene oil claimed to be below the standard degree; that said grocer had retailed it to his customers; that a certain instrument for testing oils under said act had been prescribed by the State Board of Health. The analyst of the said board for the western district of Hew York (S. A. lattimer, Prof, of Chemistry, Boehester University), testified that he had tested samples of the oil so sold, with the prescribed instrument, and found that the samples flashed at from 11 degrees to 94 degrees. It also appeared that the oil sold was not naphtha, or other light product of petroleum, to be used in accord anoe with Â§ 4 of the act.
The defendant testified that he bought the oil of the Phoenix Oil Company, of Buffalo, supposing it to be of the required standard. He knew Delano was in the grocery business, but refused to state that he knew for what purpose the oil was purchased.
The testimony of B. A. Stranahan', an officer of said company, given in behalf of the defense, tended to show that the oil sold defendant, when tested by said company, by an instru- , ment in use by them and different from that prescribed by the State Board of Health, flashed at 104 degrees.
The prosecution called, in rebuttal, Dr. E. G-. Love, one of the public analysts of the southern district of Mew York, who testified that the instrument used for tests by Stranahan was not correct; that oil would not flash at as low a temperature under that test as under the one authorized by the Board of Health ; that the_ burning point had nothing to do with the flashing point, as the latter is the point at which the oil gives out an inflammable vapor which ignites, whereas the oil itself may not ignite.
The Court charged the jury, in substance, as follows:
First. That the question of the quality of the oil was to be decided, for the purpose of the trial, by the tests, methods, and instruments established by the State Board.
Second. That if the jury found that Mobles knew, when Delano purchased the oil, it was to be retailed to customers for â€¢the ordinary purpose, of heating and illuminating, he was liable under the act; that if was not a defense for Mobles to plead that he had no personal'knowledge of the quality of the oil.
Mobles, like every other citizen, was bound to know the law. That if the regulation in regard to testing had been incorporated in the Statute, there could be no question about Mobles having received proper notice; but it was insisted, on the part of the defense, that the question of the methods and regulations regarding the testing having been referred to another body, i. e., the State. Board of Health, for determination, the same rule did â– not apply, and that the people must prove that Mobles received actual notice of these rules and regulations before making the sale ; but the ruling is that as Mobles knew of the passage of the act and the time it was to take effect, the jury would inquire and determine whether it was not his duty to inform himself within a reasonable time as to what rules and regulations had been adopted by the Board of Health.
The jury brought in a verdict of guilty.

1164480,WRIGHT v. PEOPLE,1883-01,"Smith, P. J.
The indictment in this case charges the plaintiff in error, and John Riley, Matthew Regan, and Richard Mullin, with burning a certain salt block or building erected for the manufacture of salt, in the city of Syracuse, the property of Martin Cooney, on the 23d of April, 1881.
The plaintiff in error was tried separately and convicted. The evidence showed that in the spring of 1881, Cooney owned six salt-blocksâ€”three in Syracuse, and three at Greenpoint, in the town of Salina, and that the three blocks last mentioned were burned about one oâ€™clock in the morning of April 23, and the salt block described in the indictment was burned about fourteen hours later. The counsel for the people gave evidence which he claimed tended to show that both fires were caused by the agency of the plaintiff in error, and the persons indicted with him.
The prosecution put in evidence against the objection and exception of the counsel for the plaintiff in error an anonymous letter received by Cooney about two days before the fires, threatening him, in a certain contingency, with the loss of his life and the burning of his salt-blocks. There was no proof of the authorship of the letter. The only evidence tending to connect the defendant with it, in any way, was the following : It was proved that Cooney,.on receiving the letter, caused it to be published in one of the newspapers in the city, and the next morning, on his going to the salt-block, where Riley and Wright were at work, Riley, in the presence of Wright, said to Cooney that he would be billed for publishing the letter, and that his salt-blocks would be burned. It is now contended by the counsel for the people that the letter was admissible as part of the res gestee and as evidence of the extent of the alleged conspiracy The difficulty with the position is that as against the plaintiff in error it is evidence of nothing whatever. He is not shown to have had any hand in writing or sending it, or to have known of its existence till he heard it spoken of by Riley in the conversation above stated. ' The letter was probably received in evidence for the purpose of showing why Cooney was watching his property and was in a position to see who approached it shortly before the fire broke out. But it was wholly unnecessary to show a reason for his watchfulness; or, if proof of the reason tended to corroborate his testimony that he watched, or made it more probable, it was enough to state in general terms that he had been put on his guard by the receipt of an anonymous letter, without giving its contents. It is obvious that the letter may have had an effect upon the jury very damaging to the plaintiff in error. Its reception was error. . It was also error to admit proof of what Biley said to Cooney in the presence of Wright, as above stated. The court remarked, in overruling the objection to it on behalf of Wright, that it was competent as against him upon the theory that silence gives consent. But that rule applies only against a party who is so concerned in what is said as that unless he speaks, his silence may fairly be construed as an admission. Wright was in no such position; Bileyâ€™s remark was not prompted by anything Wright had said, and he was not called on to make any reply to it.
â–?James Kehoe, a witness on the part of the defendant, was asked, on cross-examination, if he had ever been arrested;1 and he answered that he had been arrested once for drunkenness The question was duly objected to. The testimony had no legitimate tendency to impeach the witness, and its admission was error. People v. Crapo, 76 N. Y. 291; Ryan v. People, 79 N. Y. 599.
Objection was taken to the admission of proof of the burning of the salt-blocks at Greenpoint. That testimony was offered for the purpose of showing that the burning of those buildings, and the burning of those charged in the indictment, were parts of one scheme, concocted and carried out by Wright and his associates.
Por that purpose the testimony was proper; and as the bill of exceptions does not purport to give all the evidence, we are to assume that sufficient was shown to establish that theory to the satisfaction of the jury. But as the improper testimony above pointed out may have contributed materially to that result, we must set aside the conviction and grant a new trial.
The conviction and judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered in the Court of Sessions of Onondaga county.
Haedust, J., concurs.
Note.â€”In People v, Crapo the question held by the Court of Appeals to be improper was, â€œWere you . . arrested on a charge of
bigamy ? â€?The Supreme Court, at General Term, say (15 Hun, 272), â€œWe cannot conceive how anybody could suppose this question could be admissible.â€?The well-settled rule in this State is that to render such a question inadmissible there must be a claim of privilege on behalf of the prisoner. This was not done in the cases of Brandon v. People, 42 H. Y. 266; Connors v. People, 50 N. Y. 240; nor (so far at it appears) in People n. Casey, 72 N. Y 293, and the question was admitted.
In People v. Brown, 72 N. Y. 571, privilege was claimed, and the question held inadmissible.
In People r. Hovey, ante, p. 180, prisoner was asked, on cross-examination : Q. How often have you been in prison? A. Three times. Q. For what? A. For stealing. Q. Bach time? A. Tes, sir.

Such questions are rendered admissible by Â§ 832 of Code Civ. Procedure; Â§ 714 of Penal Code.

1164458,PEOPLE v. WHITE,1883-09,"Pratt, J.
The defendant, with one McLuckey, was convicted on a charge of stealing six chickens, by a Court of Special Sessions, at the town of Cortland, Westchester county, and sentenced for five mouths to the Albany County Penitentiary, and on appeal the said conviction was affirmed by the Court of Sessions of Westchester county.
McLuckey is now serving out his term of imprisonment in the penitentiary, and the defendant, Jeremiah White is confined in the county jail of Westchester county, on an order staying said judgment, and this appeal is brought on behalf of the said Jeremiah White only.
It is claimed that the defendant was convicted upon declarations made by McLuckey to the officer in the absence of the defendant. This is true, but the evidence was competent against his co-defendant, and was admitted without objection.
The defendant afterward moved to strike out the evidence, which was properly refused. The proper motion was that the justice should instruct the jury not to consider the evidence as against the defendant. Such motion was not made, and the motion that was made to strike out the evidence was properly overruled.
The charge of the complaint was petit larceny, and the property alleged to have been stolen was of some intrinsic value.
The case was fairly tried and properly submitted to the jury, and we think the evidence was amply sufficient to justify the finding of the verdict.
Conviction affirmed.

1164482,PEOPLE v. LEIGHTON,1882-05,"Daniels, J.
The defendant is now under sentence of death upon a conviction of the crime of murder in the first degree, and this motion is made because of newly discovered evidence, which it is claimed would probably have changed the result if it had been produced upon the trial already had. The application is made under the authority of the recent amendment to Â§ 466 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This amendment in no manner enlarges or qualifies the grounds previously provided for, upon which a motion of this nature may be made. But it simply provides that in this class of cases the motion may be made after judgment, and it must accordingly be determined under the other provisions contained in the Code.
By subdivision 7, section 465, of this Code, a new trial in a criminal case may be ordered because of newly discovered evidence when that would probably have changed the verdict if it had been received, and it is not cumulative. What was intended by the use of this last phrase has been no otherwise defined in the Code than by the mere fact of its employment. But as it was, at the time, a phrase of well known significance, it is to be presumed that the legislature made use of it in the sense in which it had come to be understood in legal proceedings. By that understanding evidence is cumulative when it is of the same nature as that previously produced to establish the same fact or facts. Peck v. Hiler, 30 Barb. 655, 659 ; Parker v. Hardy, 24 Pick. 246, 248; People v. Super. Ct., 10 Wend. 655.
It has been urged in support of the motion that this rule should not be applied when the evidence given upon the trial has been elicited from the party accused as a witness in his own behalf.' But there seems to be no adequate reason for making such an exception to the rule. For when the accused is sworn upon his trial, he becomes a witness in the case. He is then a witness for himself, and was made competent for that purpose by an act in terms designating him as a witness. 3 Rav. Stat. 6th ed. 1832, Â§ 43. And when he elected to place himself in the position of a witness, lie did so subject to all the rights and disabilities attending that relation to the trial. And no good reason has been discovered which should relieve him from the obligations of this rule. The legislature has certainly exhibited no such intent iii the enactment of the provisions under which this motion has been made. It has in terms provided that the application shall not be successful when the evidence is cumulative, and no exception to this provision has in any form whatever been made. If the evidence claimed to have been newly discovered, sustains this relation to that given upon the trial, then the effect of the provision is that the new trial shall not be permitted. And that relation can be as well sustained by it, to the evidence of the accused himself, as it can be to that of any other witness sworn in the case.
The point is therefore presented whether the evidence now proposed to be produced is of a cumulative nature, as that has been defined by the rule already mentioned. And this must be' determined by a comparison of this evidence with that given upon the trial. The statement contained in the first of the affidavits is, that â€œthe woman struck at the man with something that looked to deponent like a stick, and the man immediately struck back; that at once she put her hands to the side of her face, as it appeared to deponent, and went quickly into the basement of the adjacent house.â€?In the other affidavit the statement is that â€?deponent saw the woman strike at the man with what appeared to him to be a stick, whereupon the man struck back and the woman went into a basement.â€?Upon the trial, the prisoner, referring to the same occasion, stated that he said : â€?Mary, wonâ€™t you give me my coat?â€?â€?and as she raised the iron I struck her;â€?â€?she raised this curling iron ;â€?â€?I had it in my hand after; for when she struck me I got it in my left hand together with my caneâ€?our blows were simultaneous.â€?This evidence, which was given by the accused -upon his trial, related to the same occurrence as that mentioned by the persons making the affidavits, and it renders that which it is stated they would be able to give upon another trial, plainly cumulative; for it is of the same nature as that proposed to be given, and detailing what took place substantially as the prisoner himself did when he was sworn in his own behalf.
But even if this rule should not be applied when the evidence of the same nature has been given by the accused, it would still be cumulative within the legal signification of that rule. For the witness Peterson, who was examined on behalf of the accused, testified that she saw these.persons together, and heard Mrs. Dean say : â€?I know you are a man and I am a woman, but I certainly will do it, and she was in the act of doing somethingâ€?she was shaking something in the prisonerâ€™s face what she shook she stated was like the curling iron shown; she then said that she passed them and turned around, and saw the prisoner standing, who then turned around and ran. This, though not given with the same degree of detail, was still substantially what the prisoner himself had sworn to, and was in effect the same as the evidence the persons who mude these affidavits stated they would be able to give upon another trial. In any view of the case, this evidence would be cumulative within the rule to which reference has already been made.
The fact of the deceased striking at the prisoner, which is all that the newly discovered evidence would show, was presented upon and considered at the trial. And when that has been done, it has become the policy of the law not to allow the same thing to be tried again, even though further evidence of the nature of .that produced upon the trial might be given in its support.
But if this further evidence had been given upon the trial, it is not probable that it would have changed the verdict, for there was evidence in the case from which the jury could very well infer, as they did, that the prisoner took the life of this woman with a premeditated and deliberate design to do that. From what transpired when they last met, it appeared that a misunderstanding had arisen between them. She then desired to avoid an interview with him, while he insisted upon it, and when it was concluded, he inflicted this mortal wound upon her with a razor that he had carried about his person during the day.
In the afternoon preceding the interview he had been seen passing and repassing the place of this womanâ€™s residence. And there was evidence that he had previously intimated a design to inflict some serious injury upon her person. These cireumstances, with, what transpired at the time when he did inflict the mortal wound, were of such a nature that the jury could conclude from them that he repaired to her residence in the evening intending to do what he afterward accomplished. And if he went there, as the jury found he did, actuated by such a design, then he was guilty of murder in the first degree, and the legal nature of his act would not be changed by the circumstance that the woman struck at him with'the curling iron before he carried this design into effect. That probably was the view which the jury adopted and upon which their verdict was founded. And adding further evidence relating to the fact of her striking at him', to that which was given upon the trial, could not by any possibility have changed the result. If these circumstances induced the conclusion that he inflicted this wound from a deliberate and premeditated design to kill the woman, their force and effect would not be in the least diminished by adding the testimony of the newly discovered witnesses to that given upon the trial, showing that she struck at him with this curling iron. Upon neither view' of the evidence is there any ground for setting aside this verdict.
The motion made will therefore be denied.

1164422,PEOPLE v. GIBBS,1883-10,"Miller, J.
The defendant was indicted for the crime of an assault with intent to kill one Mabee. He was tried at the Tompkins County Sessions, and convicted of the crime of ah assault with intent to do bodily harm. The evidence upon the trial showed that the alleged assault took place at or near the premises which were then occupied in part by Mabee, between the hours -of seven and eight oâ€?clock of the evening of the 20th of May, 1882. Mabee was in possession of the premises, and the defendant claimed the right to enter upon the same, his wife having been in occupation of a portion thereof, which she had left in the charge of Mabee. The defendant fired his pistol in different parts of the house, threatening to kill the people therein, and there was proof showing that one or more of the shots came very near the persons of some of the inmates, of whom Mabee was one, and that defendantâ€™s intention was to have them do so. After this affray the defendant set fire to a bed, bedstead, and slats, which he had thrown out of the window into the yard. The proof shows that while this fire was burning Mabee came out on the porch, and the defendant fired two shots at him; After this, and at about half-past nine oâ€™clock, one Johnson and two other persons came to this place while the fire was still burning, and an altercation then ensued between the defendant and Johnson, and the defendant used harsh and violent language in regard to Mabee, and Johnson defended him. Under the objection of defendantâ€™s counsel the prosecution then proved an affray between the defendant and Johnson, in which the defendant drew a pistol and attempted to fire it. The pistol went off in the scuffle, and Johnson knocked the defendant down, and with the aid of two other persons tied him fast. The defendant was also indicted for this last offense. The objection made was not to the language which the defendant used in regard to Mabee, but to the evidence showing the affray between him and Johnson, and we think it was well taken. The effect of the evidence was to present to the jury testimony relating to another assault and to an entirely different transaction, which might well tend to prejudice their minds against the defendant in reference to the- charge for which he was on trial. The allegation in the indictment was that he intended to kill Mabee, and testimony showing an intent to kill another person instead of Mabee could throw no light upon the question whether in the previous affray he had intended to kill Mabee. Mabee was not present at the time of the last affray, and no act of violence of the defendant toward Johnson could possibly affect or injure Mabee. The judge, in his charge, referred to the transaction as evidence tending to throw light upon the temper or feeling of the defendant toward Mabee. It is difficult to see how the assault upon Johnson could bear upon the question as to defendantâ€™s intention while engaged in an affray, some two hours previously, with Mabee.
The principle upon which evidence is admitted of other offenses to show the intent of the defendant in reference to the one for which he is upon trial, has no application to a case of this kind. Evidence may be given upon an indictment for passing counterfeit money to establish the passing of other bills of a similar character, for the purpose of showing the intent of the defendant in reference to the passing of the bill for which he is upon trial. So, also, where guilty knowledge is an ingredient of the offense, evidence may be given of the commission of other acts of a like character where they are necessarily connected with that which is the subject of the prosecution, either by some connection of time or place, or as furnishing a clue to the motive on the part of the accused, as in the case of receiving stolen goods, knowing them to be such. Coleman v. People, 58 N. Y. 555.
But this rule can have no application to two different assaults, committed at different times and at different places, and upon different persons, where the motive in the one case could upon no sound principle be the same as in the other. It is very manifest that the defendant in the assault upon Johnson could not possibly have intended to kill Mabee, and the testimony relating to the same could have no bearing whatever upon the offense-for which the defendant was upon trial. Uor can the evidence be justified upon the ground that it was a part of the res gestae.' The assault proven occurred some time after the assault upon Mabee, for which the defendant was upon trial, and was at a different place. . It did not arise directly from the altercation with Mabee, but originated in a quarrel with another and a different person in Mabeeâ€™s absence, and without any intent at the moment to injure Mabee. Johnson had offended the defendant, and he assaulted him with great violence, attempting to use his pistol, which was taken from him, and his aim and object was to injure Johnson. In the case considered, the res gestae was the assault made by the defendant upon Mabee, and the assault upon Johnson did not in any form constitute a part of the former act.
Under the circumstances it is clear that the evidence was inadmissible, and it being apparent that it had no relation to the case upon trial it was erroneously received.
As the judgment must be reversed for the error already stated, it is not necessary to consider the other questions raised.
The judgment and conviction should be reversed and new trial granted.
All concur.

1164449,PEOPLE v. HOVEY,1883-10,"Per Curiam.
In view of the grave interest involved in this case, we have examined the facts presented in the papers on which the application for a new trial was made, without considering or passing upon the question whether an appeal lies to this court, from an order denying a motion for a new trial, in a criminal case, made after conviction and judgment, on the ground of newly discovered evidence.
The newly discovered evidence is in substance, set forth in the affidavit of the physician who saw the prisoner on the day following the homicide at the prison. The physician, in substance, states at that time the prisoner was oblivious of what had occurred for a week before. ,He further states that he ascertained that the prisoner was accustomed' to the use of opiates and sedatives of various kinds. This evidence is only material as it bears upon the criminal responsibility of the prisoner at the time of the homicide; but it is apparent that its bearing upon the point, to say the most, is quite remote. The want of consciousness of the prisoner, on the morning after the homicide, of his acts for a week before, may be quite consistent with the possession of his faculties at the time. It does not appear that he was not, when the examination was made, under the immediate influence of drugs, taken after the homicide ; that his condition observed by the physician was not attributable to that cause.
The facts found on the trial tend to show that the homicide was the willful, conscious, and deliberate act of the prisoner. The prisoner was sworn on the trial, and while professing to recollect the whole occurrence, attributed the homicide to accident. It is not proposed to show, by any acquaintance of the prisoner, that before, the homicide he was not in possession of his reason and accountable for his acts. It may be inferred that he was accustomed, to some extent, to the use of intoxicating drink, but nothing was proved on that trial from which a just inference could be drawn at that the time of the homicide liis power of will or deliberation was affected or weakened by this cause.
It is doubtless true that no adequate motive for the homicide was shown, but this is by no means an unusual fact in criminal cases.
The General Term has carefully considered the case, and we are constrained to concur in the conclusion reached, that a case is not made for the intervention of the court in granting a new trial.
The order affirming the order denying the motion is affirmed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164450,MATTER OF HOFFMAN,1883-10,"Westbrook, J.
The prisoner must be discharged, because the magistrate had no power to impose a sentence in the disjunctive. Either a fine or an imprisonment, or both, should have been imposed, but the sentence should state whether it was one of the two, or both, which the prisoner was to suffer. By the language of the commitment, the prisoner is adjudged either to pay a fine of fifty dollars or to be imprisoned for three months, but it is not definitely and distinctly stated which one will satisfy the judgment. Undoubtedly, the magistrate could impose a fine and also adjudge the' length of imprisonment to be endured if such fine was not paid. This, however, is not the form of the judgment, but the sentence is simply in the disjunctive, without any declaration that by the payment of the fine the condemned will escape the imprisonment.
There is another- question which the sentence imposed involves, and it is this : Conceding that such sentence only imposes an imprisonment provided the fine is not paid, is not the power-to imprison for one year in case of non-payment- of the fine, conferred by chapter 18 of the laws of 1876, taken away by section 718 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which declares that the imprisonment to be endured in case a fine is not paid â€?cannot exceed one day for every one dollar of the fine.â€?The former is a special statute and the latter a general one, but does not the policy of the law require judges to hold that a subsequent general statute prescribing the maximum of punishment for an offense is a repeal of a prior special statute authorizing a greater .penalty for the same offense ? This question, however, is not' decided (see Matter of'Wacher, 62 How. 352; People v. Coffee, Id. 445, and note, page 449 ; Matter of Bayard, 61 Id. 294; Matter of Coughlin, 62 Id. 34), as it has not been argued. It is sufficient to justify the prisonerâ€™s discharge that the penalty imposed is not specific. In other words, the magistrate has not exercised the discretion conferred upon him by statute by specifying clearly the punishment he intended to inflict. The general principle of law which condemns the commitment as bad is expressly recognized in our Code (Â§ 718), which, in addition to the limitation upon the length of the imprisonment hereinbefore stated, also declares â€?a judgment that the defendant pay a fine may also direct that he be imprisoned until the fine be satisfied.â€?In other words, both the general law and the Criminal Code require, if a fine is the punishment inflicted, that the sentence and commitment shall so state, and the right to imprison shall only exist if such fine is not paid.
For the reasons stated, the prisoner is entitled to his discharge. 1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164491,PEOPLE v. WELCH,1883-01,"Hardin, J.
As this trial which we are called upon to review, took place at the Herkimer County Oyer and Terminer, in June, 1882, the Code of Criminal Procedure is applicable to it. That Code took effect September 1, 1881. Code Crim. Pro. Â§ 963 ; L. 1881, c. 442.
To George Snyder, a juror, a â€?challenge for actual bias â€?was taken by the defendant, as by sections 386, 368 and 366, he was authorized to do. Facts upon which the challenge rested being denied, the trial of the challenge was to be, and was, had before the court.
Section 383 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is, viz. : â€œUpon the trial of a challenge to an individual juror, the juror challenged may be examined as a witness to prove or disprove the challengeâ€?.... Section 384, declares, viz.: â€œOther witnesses may also be examined on either side â€?....
No other witness was examined upon the trial of the challenge to Snyder, and the conclusion upon the question of fact involved in the trial was reached by the trial court, in the exercise 'of a sound discretion (Â§ 376), that George Snyder was a competent juror, after hearing and considering the testimony of Snyder, the juror. The same rules of evidence are applicable to such trial of a challenge as apply to the trial of â€?other issues.â€?Code Crim. Pro. Â§ 384.
It is expressly provided in section 465,of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that an exception may be taken to a decision â€?in admitting or rejecting testimony on the trial of a challenge for actual bias to a juror .... or in allowing or disallowing such challenge.â€?In section 395 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it is declared that â€œa challenge is an objection to trial jurorsâ€?. . . . either to the panel or â€?to an individual juror.â€?Section 370 divides challenges into two kinds, viz. : â€?Peremptory,â€?or, â€?second, for cause;â€?and a challenge for cause is an objection to a particular juror, and it may be either general or particular. It is general when the objection is that the juror is â€œdisqualified from serving in any case,â€?or, secondly, it may be â€¢â€?particular, that he is disqualified from serving in the case on trial.â€?Â§ 375.
By section 376, â€?particular causes of challenge are of two kinds the first is when there is â€?simple bias,â€?and the second is when there is â€œactual bias.â€?The latter is the character of the challenge taken in the case now before us. That section sets down a rule for determining the question presented here, and we must consider the second subdivision of the section, which is as follows, viz.: â€œSecond. For the existence of a state of mind on the part of a juror, in reference to the case or either party, which satisfies the court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, that such juror cannot try the issues impartially and without prejudice to the substantial rights of the party challenging, and which is known in this Code as actual bias.â€?.....
It was the duty of the court, when the challenge was upon trial, to consider whether Snyder, the juror challenged, then had the existence of â€?a state of mind â€?in reference to the case or the defendant which satisfied the court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, â€œthat the juror could not impartially and without prejudice to the substantial rightsâ€?of the defendant try the issue formed by the allegations of the indictment and the denial thereof by means of the plea of not guilty interposed by the defendant.
In considering the evidence furnished by the examination of the juror, the court was called upon to observe the language and spirit of that portion of section 376 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which is a substantial re-enactment of the statute of 1872, in respect to the formation or expression of an opinion or impression by a juror. That portion of the section reads, viz.: â€?But the previous expression or f ormation of an opinion or impression in reference thereto is not a sufficient ground of challenge for actual bias, to any person, otherwise legally qualified, if he declares on oath that he believes that such opinion or impression will not influence his verdict, and that he can render an impartial verdict according to the evidence, and the court is satisfied that he does not entertain such present opinion or impression as would influence his verdict.â€?Under the act of 1872, which has been the subject of frequent judicial interpretation, several cases have been considered, and from those cases we may deduce the following results:
(1.) That the legislature intended to remove the strict and stringent rule existing before the legislation to which we have referred, which attached a disqualification to the fact of forming and expressing an opinion, which led Marshall, Oh. J., to say, in 1 Burr Trial, 416, of such a juror, â€?that the law will not trust him; â€?and which led to holding in many other cases, that a hypothetical opinion, or an impression simply, of the guilt or innocence of the prisoner, derived from rumor, or from reading newspaper accounts of the transaction, tended strongly to support a Â¡challenge for principal cause. Balbo v. People, 80 N. Y. 494.
(2.) That the fact that a juror has formed an opinion of the guilt or innocence of a prisoner â€?is no longer in any'case a legal disqualification, provided the juror makes the declaration specified in the statute.â€?Cox v. People, 80 N. Y. 513.
(3.) That the question of a jurorâ€™s competency is to be determined, in ""each case, as a question of fact, and each case must rest upon its own peculiar features. Balbo v. People, supra.
(4.) That when a juror has read in a newspaper the evidence taken in-a former trial, and formed an opinion therefrom, in a case where the evidence is circumstantial, and where the testimony is likely to be repeated, and the juror would hear it with its result already lodged in his mind, â€?he ought not to be permitted to sit.â€?Greenfield v. People, 74 N. Y. 277, and the opinion of Pinch, J., in People v. Oyer and Terminer, 83 N. Y. 458, and of Talcott, J., in Manke v. People, 17 Bun, 411, referring to the Greenfield case.
(5.) That although a juror has read about a case in a newspaper, but has not a fixed and settled opinion, but has an impression based upon a certain fact or condition of facts if proved to be true, and with such an opinion he would be governed by the evidence and render a verdict accordingly, he may be allowed to sit, if the court, under the circumstances disclosed by him, after seeing and hearing the juror, is of the opinion that he is unbiased. Abbott v. People, 86 N. Y. 467; opinion of Miller, J. See Manke v. People, supra.
Now, with these cases before us, we are called upon to review the conclusion of the court below, that the juror Snyder had not such a state of mind â€?in reference to the case of the defendant as to render him incapable of trying the issue impartially, and without prejudice to the substantial rights of the party challenging.â€?The juror was a farmer, residing in the town of Horway, some twenty miles away from Little Falls, where the murder occurred. He was fifty-eight years of age, and he read an account of it in the â€?Journal and Courier,â€?published at Little Falls. When asked if he had read the evidence as published in that paper, or what purported to be the evidence, he answered, â€?I am rather inclined to think I did ; could not be positive.â€?He had read the editorial comments, though he could recollect no â€?particulars about it.â€?He said he formed an opinion, and it would take evidence to remove it, and he would not go into the-jury-box with a mind free from prejudice, free from opinion ; and he said, â€?I donâ€™t know as I should require a great deal of preponderance of evidence on the part of the prisoner to remove my impressions, but I should require some.â€?Later on in his testimony, he was asked, viz. : â€?If you were accepted as a juror in the case, and the oath administered to you, and you took your seat in the box, would yon lay aside and leave any former impression you may have had upon the subject and receive the evidence and act impartially ?â€?His answer was, viz.: â€?That is what I would act upon wholly.â€?Again, he was asked, viz.: â€œAs a juror you would act entirely upon the evidence which was produced here upon the trial?â€?His answer was, viz.: â€?Yes, sir;â€?and he added, he thought no information or impression which he had gained would influence him in any particular in his action as a juror. Some other statements appear in his evidence in respect to the impression made by reading the newspaper, and he stated that he understood that when he got iÂ» the jury-box he would be controlled, by the evidence entirely. He y^as quite as well qualified as the juror Toplitz in People V. Oyer and Terminer, referred to in the opinion of Finch, J., 83 N. Y. 457. Heading his evidence carefully through, as we find it in the appeal book, and bearing in mind the precedent to which we have referred, we cannot say that the trial court did not, in the exercise of a â€?sound discretion,â€?come to a proper conclusion.
Giving that conclusion its proper influence upon us, coming as it does from a court that heard and saw the juror, we do not see any feature of the evidence in the case which should lead us to differ with the trial court, and we cannot declare â€œthat the juror possessed any â€œactual biasâ€?against the defendant or his case, after applying the rule laid down in section 376 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the cases to which we have adverted. We may conclude what we have to say with the language of Judge Milleb, found at page 469 of 86 JY. Y. in Abbottâ€™s case, where he says, viz.: â€?It was very evident that the alleged opinion was merely an impression which would not affect the juror in the conscientious discharge of his duty, and the court, under the circumstances, seeing the juror and his manner of testifying, .were justified in holding that he was competent.â€?Ho other question arises upon the appeal book. We must affirm the conviction and judgment.

1164452,PEOPLE ex rel. BURGESS v. RISLEY,1883-09,"Westbrook, J.
The relator, George Burgess, has been committed by a magistrate of the county of Ulster in default of bail to await the action of the grand jury upon a charge of burglary. The Court of Oyer and Terminer to be held in and for the County of Ulster, at which the case will be presented for the action of the grand jury, convenes on November 19 next.
The sheriff of Ulster county, in whose custody as the keeper of the common jail the relator is, acting in good faith and under advice which he believes to be correct, refuses to his counsel, William D. Brinnier, a private interview with him. The relator asks for an order allowing such an interview.
The Constitution of the state (article 1, section 6) provides that â€?in any trial, in any court whatever, the party accused shall be allowed to appear and defend in person and with counsel, as in civil actions.â€?In People ex'rel. Garling v. Van Allen (55 N. Y. 31), the provision of the constitution just quoted was held applicable to a court-martial.
Perhaps the letter of the constitutional provision would be complied with by allowing to the accused the benefit of counsel upon the â€?trial,â€?but such a construction would illustrate the truth of that part of the old maxim which declares â€œThe letter killeth,â€?and disregard its conclusion, â€?while the spirit giveth life.â€?Undoubtedly the clause of the constitution under consideration was adopted to secure to the accused person all the benefits which could flow from the employment of counsel to conduct his defense; and to give him those it is essential that he should be allowed to consult with his counsel not only during the actual trial, but prior thereto, in order to prepare for his defense. Where a right is conferred by law, everything necessary for its protection is also conferred, although not directly provided for. The privilege of the presence of counsel upon the trial would be a poor concession to the accused, if the right of consultation with such counsel prior to the trial was denied. To give life and effect, therefore, to the provision of the constitution under consideration, it must be held to confer upon the relator every privilege which will make the presence of counsel upon the trial a valuable right, and this must include a- private interview with his counsel prior to the trial.
It is said, however, that there is no indictment as yet against the relator, and that therefore the constitutional provision does#-not apply. This is also, it seems to me, a narrow interpretation of the fundamental law. The relator is in jail and adjudged probably guilty of a grave crime. He has rights even before indictment. He may claim, perhaps, that his detention is illegal; that the evidence taken before the magistrate was insufficient, and may desire, through counsel, to obtain a writ of habeas corpus, or some other process, to inquire into the legality of his . imprisonment. He needs for all this, counsel competent to advise, and a private interview for consultation. Is he to be deprived of this because the letter of the fundamental law does not give it ? Or shall the spirit which procured the adoption of the provision be invoked to give it life? What was that spirit ? Manifestly it was a recognition of the great doctrine that, â€?With us it is a universal principle of constitutional law that the prisoner shall be allowed a defense by counsel.â€?Cooleyâ€™s Cons. Lim. 334.
Ho good reason can be assigned why the word trial, occurring in the constitution, should be construed to mean the final inquiry upon the accusation only, and not any and every step which may be taken to inquire into the imprisonment. It should, to give force and effect to the spirit which prompted it, be so construed as to give to every one accused of or arrested for crime the benefit of counsel at every step and stage of the proceeding.
This construction is demanded by every consideration of humanity, and the enlightened views of personal rights resulting from Christian civilization.
Whilst holding these views no censure is imposed either upon the sheriff or district attorney. They have' both acted in good faith and with due regard for the public interests, their care and vigilance having been aroused by what they deemed to be suspicious conduct on the part of the prisoner. The time of the convening of the grand jury is, however, now so near that the request of the prisoner for a private interview with his counsel should be granted. The sheriff may, of course, take proper precautions to see that no instrument of escape shall be conveyed to the prisoner, and may also, i-f he dÃ­as good reason to suppose that the consultation with the prisoner will be used .for an improper purpose, apply to the court for further instructions.
Upon the facts now before me, no reason sufficient to prevent an interview by the counsel employed with the relator is shown, and the private consultation asked for be allowed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164428,PEOPLE v. NOELKE and MARKS,1883-11,"Finch, J.
TJpon the principal questions in this case the opinion of the General Term is so accurate and full as to make unnecessary any repetition of its reasoning in expressing our concurrence. It holds that the indictment ""was sufficient, because the word lottery, if it has no technical legal meaning, as this court has said (Wilkinson v. Gill, 74 JV. Y. 66), and is to be construed in its popular sense, indicates a scheme for the distribution of prizes, and for the obtaining of money or goods by chance ; and that any possibility of doubt founded upon the use of the word is dispelled by the further allegation which sets out the form of the ticket charged to have been sold, which refers on its face to the â€?monthly two-dollar drawing,â€?and in terms â€?entitles the holder thereof to one-half of such prize as may be drawn by its number in the within-named drawing if presented for payment before the expiration of three months from the date of said drawing.â€?People v. Warner, 4 Bari. 314. It may be added that the Penal Code (Â§ 323) now defines a â€?lotteryâ€?with all needful accuracy and precision. We have attentively considered the authorities cited by the appellants, and the criticism to which they have subjected the averments of the indictment, but remain satisfied that it plainly disclosed and sufficiently charged the substance of the ofÃ­ense forbidden by the statute.
The General Term also held that if Mattocks was to be deemed an accomplice the court gave to the defendants the full benefit of the rule of the Code (Crim. Pro. Â§ 399) that a conviction could not be had upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, but that Mattocks was'not an accomplice, and so discussion upon the rule, or the evidence under it, was rendered unnecessary. We agree that Mattocks was not an accomplice, since he purchased the ticket to detect and punish a crime, and not with intent to aid in committing one.
From the point of view of the prosecution, he was a detective ; from that of the defendants, a spy, or informer; but in no sense a party to the criminal act or intent so as to become an accomplice.
The further contention that because this lottery was lawful under the law of Louisiana, and its tickets issued represented value and were property, their sale in this state could not be prohibited without violating the provisions of .the Federal constitution which give to Congress the power to regulate commerce among the several states, and forbid the passage of any law impairing the obligation of a contract, wTas properly characterized by the General Term as â€?a very extraordinary proposition.â€?The learned counsel for the appellants cites recent decisions of this court as indicating a drift in the direction of his argument, and founded upon a logic wâ€™hicli involves his conclusion: Ormes v. Dauchy, 82 N. Y. 443 ; Van Voorhis v. Brintnall, 86 N. Y. 18. Neither of these cases furnishes the slightest ground for a construction which would repeal our penal laws against lotteries, or make them absolute .nullities. In the first of these eases the precise question was, whether the contract sued upon was a violation of o'ur statute. It did not appear that the advertising of lotteries was to be done in this state, or was in fact done in this state, nor that where contracted to be done it was illegal by the law of the locality. And the recovery was sustained for the reason that our statute against lotteries was in no manner infringed. The second of these cases respected the status of the parties to-a marriage contract made in another state, and valid where made, but which would have been invalid if made within our jurisdiction. Both cases rested upon the undeniable truth that our law could have no extra-territorial operation, but neither intimated that within our jurisdiction we could not forbid the making of contracts deemed immoral and against our public' policy. There is no impairment of a contract obligation by our law against lotteries. We prohibit the making of certain contracts within our boundaries. The statute does not undertake to say what contracts may or may not be made under a foreign law, and no question is here of a contract valid elsewhere, or as to"" property brought within this state. It does not even appear that the'lottery ticket had ever been issued, or acquired any value of its own, or become a.- valid obligation anywhere, when attempted to be sold within our jurisdiction. We cannot impair what does not exist. We forbid the contract within our borders ; we do not tamper with an existing valid obligation. In the present case no valid contract was or could have been made in this state. One never came into existence, either as between Mattocks and the defendants or Mattocks and the Lottery, which under our law was valid or effectual. What happened was purely the violation of a criminal statute, and it made no difference that the lottery itself was authorized by the laws of Louisiana.- People v. Sturdevant, 23 Wend. 420; Charles v. People, 1 N.Y. 184; Grover v. Morris, 73 N.Y. 476. Our statute destroys no vested right of property innocently acquired, and in no manner regulates commerce between the states.
The defendant, LToelke, was examined on his own behalf, and on cross-examination â€™certain questions were asked which it is urged were erroneously permitted. One of these questions was whether, since prior to 1877, he had been engaged in the business of lottery tickets and lottery policies. Another was, whether he had been tried and convicted in the United States court for violating the law prohibiting the sending of matters through the United States mail with reference to the drawing of any lottery. In People v. Crapo (76 N. Y. 288), the prisoner was on tiial for burglary and larceny, and having taken the stand as a witness in his own behalf, was asked on cross-examination if he had been arrested on a charge of bigamy. This court held the question inadmissible, and stated the true rule to be that the disparaging questions must either be relevant to the issue or such as clearly go to impeach the moral character and credibility of the witness. In People v. Brown (72 N. Y. 571), the question asked the party testifying in his own behalf was, how many times he had been arrested, and it was held inadmissible. In Ryan v. People (79 N. Y. 594). the witnesses were asked if they had been indicted. This court, recognizing the right to put questions to a witness as to specific facts which tend to discredit him or impeach his moral character, held that the fact of an indictment could not produce such result, since it was merely an accusation and innocence was presumed. In People v. Oyer & Term., Co. of N. Y. (83 N. Y. 460), we said of this class of questions that our control over them was not absolute, and that as a general rule the range and extent of such an examination is within the discretion of the trial judge, subject, however, to the limitation that it must relate to matters pertinent to the issue, or to specific facts which tend to discredit the witness or impeach his moral character; and to the same effect was People v. Casey (72 N. Y. 393). The Penal Code provides that â€?a person heretofore or hereafter convicted of any crime is notwithstanding a competent witness in any cause or proceeding, civil or criminal; but the conviction may be proved, for the purpose of affecting the weight of the testimony, either by the record or his cross-examination, upon which he must answer any proper question relevant to that inquiry â€?(Â§ 714). Within these rules both questions put to the defendant in this case were proper. We cannot say that the first was not pertinent to the issue. The evidence of the party on his direct examination is not given, but we can see that if for a period of time covering the alleged illegal sale to Mattocks the witness was engaged in the lottery business, it would make much more credible the testimony of the informer. But at least a fact was inquired about which was not merely a charge or accusation but the actual commission of a crime, and an affirmative answer must necessarily have tended to discredit the witness. The second question was admissible for the reason last named, and was within the rule of the Penal Code.
Other objections taken by the appellant it is not deemed necessary to discuss.
The judgment should be affirmed.'

1164496,PEOPLE v. THOMPSON,1883,"Pratt, J.
The defendant was indicted for a misdemeanor, under chapter 784 of the Laws of 1868, in that he had taken oysters from, and for disturbing oysters upon a certain oyster bed in Pumpkin Patch Channel, a part of Jamaica Bay, which oysters had been planted by one Vreeland, to whom a license by the authorities of the town of Flatlands had been granted. The defense was that the oyster bed was a part of the public domain, being a part of the tide-waters of Jamaica Bay ; that defendant was raking for clams upon a natural clam bed which existed at that point; that he had the right there to rake for clams in the public waters; and that the disturbance of the oysters was a necessary incident of his right to rake for clams. It is conceded that the object of the proceeding is to determine the validity and force of the license under the act of 1868, and the right of the license as against the public. It was admitted that this bed was within the town of Flatlands, and hence within the territory of the State of New York. It is not pretended that the town of Flatlands ever obtained any exclusive right to the fisheries within the waters which lie within its territories. There was no evidence of any grant to the- town, and no presumptive right is claimed in its behalf. The case, therefore, shows that these waters were a part of the navigable tide-water within this State. Assuming the power, could the State exercise it through the supervisor and justices of the peace of the town \ We think the first question must be answered in the affirmative.
The opinion of the late Chief Justice Church, with the concurrence of all of his associates (Trustees of Brook-haven v. Strong, 60 N. Y. 56), indicates very clearly that at common law, the king had the right to grant to an individual, or to the inhabitants of a town, the lands under water, and the exclusive right to fish in the waters flowing over the same. We fail to see why the State has not exercised the same right as the king could have exercised in this respect. We find no prohibition or limitation upon that power. The State might have ceded the entire land and water to the town, or to individuals, subject only to the superior right to use the navigable waterâ€™s for the purposes of commerce and navigation. Â¡Rogers v. Jones, 1 Wend. 237; Trustees of Brookhaven v. Strong, 60 N. Y. 65.
It is only where it undertakes to grant the exclusive right to fisheries, disconnected with any right upon, or connected witli the soil, or in disregard of the rights of owners of the soil, that there appears to be any invasion of private right. Even in that case, it is the private right, either of the owner of the soil under or adjacent to the waters, which is disregarded or invaded. Why may not the State, as the owner of the soil and waters, subject to the public right of commerce and navigation, grant away the whole, or any part, of its own aquatic domain ? If it may grant the land and the water, why may it not grant the land without the water, or its right in the water without the land? This would seem especially plain for the purposes of planting trees, erecting or extending docks, etc., and why not for planting that kind of product which, although classed as fish, is nevertheless' a resident and dependent upon the soil almost as much as grain sown upon agricultural lands ? We cannot find the precise points decided of an original grant by the State, but it is quite plain that the State has steadily, since its organization, made analogous grants of land under water, and ratisfied old claims of that nature. The authority for such acts is too old to be questioned. If these views are correct, it would seem to follow that the State might exercise the power of leasing these lands and its right in the waters, especially for purposes which chiefly afiect the soil under the water. It would certainly authorize dumping earth at any particular point and raising an island. It could authorize the occupation of bars, or other acts, as might develope them. Why not authorize the use of the bottom for substantial sub-marine agriculture, with the incidental rights of penetrating the waters to reap the crop ? Another view"" of the subject is, that it is simply the exercise of jpolice power.
We come, then, to the second question. Could the State properly exercise this power through the town officials ? We â€?fail to discover any. restriction or hesitation in this subject. There was no delegation of the power to determine whether or not the lands and waters should be, used, but merely the selection of officers through and by whom the State should attest the fact that it had leased, and .the qualifications of the lands for the purposes of the lease, i. e., the extent in acreage, and whether or not there was a natural oyster bed.
Besides these, the State is really, by this act, following a policy for the promotion of the public good, and the benefit of all its inhabitants. It is encouraging oyster culture, affording special inducements to those who will engage in the industry upon the public domain. It protects them from annoyance, and intrusion by others upon the special field of their operationsâ€”the bottom. It is simply a police regulation ; at most an exercise of police power. Any other reasoning would lead to the conclusion that the public interest in fish culture, for the purposes of food, was wholly subservient to the individual right of each citizen to the mere pastime of catching the fish. The method by which the State shall develope its resources, especially upon the public domain, must be a matter within the discretion of the representatives of her peopleâ€”the legislature. We fail to see why the State should not select these town officers to exercise this right, quite as readily as it could have selected new officers for that purpose.
Who would deny that the State, through its own constabulary, might protect its lessees and licensees in the limitations upon fishing, quite as properly as it can limit the methods of taking fish or game to particular seasons of the year % The State might well prefer to encourage the planting of oysters, rather than to preserve natural clam beds, and that is an essential feature of the bed in question. We think the bed in question was clearly within the powers of the legislature, and that it is valid. If these views are correct, it follows that the judgment and conviction must be .affirmed.

1164468,PEOPLE v. CASSIANO,1883-09,"Barnard, P. J.
The prisoner was convicted of the crime of murder in the first decree, at the Orange County Oyer and Terminer, in January last. After the case had been given to the jury, and they had retired, and after deliberating upon the evidence, the jury requested further instructions. The prisoner was ""brought into court, and the jury were recalled. The counsel who represented the prisoner were not notified of the request of the jury, or of their recall for further instructions, and they were not, in fact, in court. By section 427 of the Code of Criminal Procedure it is provided that in case the jury return for further instructions, the counsel for the prisoner shall be notified.
In the absence of the counsel, the jury asked for the statutory punishment for murder in the second degree, â€?what the sentence is.â€?The court replied that that was not a matter for their consideration in arriving at a verdict. 'JSTecessarily there was no exception to this course, as the counsel were absent; but upon appeal it must be passed upon whether or not the refusal was right. Two questions are thus raised : was it error to answer the jury without notifying counsel, without regard to the correctness of the charge ; and, second, were the jury entitled to the information sought ?
We think it was an absolute right of the prisoner to have his counsel notified after the jury returned into court, and before they were instructed. The words of the statute (Code Crim. Pro. Â§ 427) are imperative, that the information sought by the jury â€?must be given after notice ... to the counsel for the defendant; and, in case of felony, in the presence of the defendant.â€?As to the defendantâ€™s rights to be. present, that was the requirement of the Revised Statutes ; and when correct, instructions were given in the presence of the counsel for the accused, but in his absence, the court of appeals revised the judgment. People v. Maurer, 43 N. Y. 1.
The right of an accused to counsel is part of our system. In the present case it is apparent that the counsel for the accused might have induced the court to furnish the information sought, as there can be no doubt but that it Was within the discretionary power of the court, even if it was not a legal right. We think the information should have been given. In all cases the jury should know the effect of their verdict. While it is proper to instruct them that When a crime is proven the extent of the punishment therefore is no sufficient reason why a verdict according to the facts found should not be rendered ; yet, as part of the case, the punishment should be known by the jury. It.was therefore a fatal error not to notify the defendantâ€™s counsel when the jury asked for further instructions.
It is not material to examine the question whether the jury were authorized to take into their consideration the intoxicated condition of the defendant when the crime was committed, in determining the question whether the blow was struck in sudden passion, and without the deliberation now needed to constitute murder in the first degree.' Since the trial of the case, the present Code has gone into effect, and by section 22 it is provided that the fact that the accused was intoxicated at the time can be taken into consideration in determining purpose, . motive, or intent.
The conviction should be reversed and a new trial granted.

1164499,MATTER OF MOSES,1883-10,"Per Curiam.
Section 291 of the Penal Code declares under what circumstances children shall be regarded as vagrants ; and, amongst other things, it provides that a female child under the age of fourteen years who is found begging or receiving or soliciting alms in any manner, or under any pretense frequenting the company of prostitutes, â€?must be arrested, and brought before the proper court or magistrate as a vagrant, disorderly, or destitute child.â€?It also declares that such court or magistrate may commit the child to any charitable, reformatory or other institution authorized by law to receive and take charge of minors, or make such disposition of the child as is now or may hereafter be authorized in the case of vagrants, truants, paupers, or disorderly persons.
Section 887 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in defining who are vagrants, provides that any child between the ages of five and fourteen, having sufficient bodily health and mental capacity to attend public schools, found wandering in the streets of any city or incorporated village a truant without any lawful occupation, shall be deemed a vagrant.
The children in the case before us were arrested as vagrants, and taken before one of the Police Justices of the city, and by him committed to the House of Refuge, which is in the care of the Society for the Reformation of Juvenile Delinquents. The warrants of commitment recite in substance that these children, being under the age of fourteen year's, were charged, on the oath of George H. Young, with being vagrants, namely, â€œengaged in the occupation of begging under the pretext of peddling, to wit, Bowery, in said city, at 10:45 oâ€™clock p.m. , on the 5th of April, 1883, and frequenting the company of prostitutes, concert saloons, dance-houses and places of entertainment where spirituous liquors were sold.â€?It further recited that the magistrate caused the children to be brought before him for examination on the charge, and proceeded to inquire into the matter in their presence; and having read the proofs and allegations submitted to him, and duly, considered said matter, the child named in each one respectively was duly â€?convicted, on the competent testimony of George H. Young, of being such vagrants,â€?and was adjudged by the magistrate to be a proper object to be committed to the House of Refuge.
By certiorari in the proceedings, addressed to the Police Justice, the clerk returned to the court the affidavit of George H. Young, and certified that that comprised all the record of the case then on file in that Court. This affidavit, which was sworn to before the Police Justice who convicted the children of vagrancy, states their ages to he, respectively, eleven and thirteen years, and that they were found by him doing the acts of alleged vagrancy, which are described substantially in the same language as that used in the warrants. It is apparent, on the face of the affidavit, that it was made at the hearing before the magistrate.
The learned judge in the court below fell into the error of supposing that the children had been arrested under the provisions of sec. 887 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and he held that the offense was not properly charged to bring them within that section, because it was not alleged that they were found wandering and begging in the streets. But it is obvious that the complaint was made under section 291 of the Penal Code already referred-to, under which it is not necessary to show ' that the' children were found wandering in the streets. The act of begging, or receiving, or soliciting alms makes children under the ages named in the section vagrants, and so when found frequenting the company of reputed thieves or prosti- > tutes. Those offenses are sufficiently charged, both in the affidavit and in the warrant of commitment. If it were necessary to recite the particular act of vagrancy (which was helcl not to be the ease in Grayâ€™s case, 11 Abb. 56), where it is said that-the words defining the particular acts of vagrancy may be regarded as surplusage, yet in this ease the acts are specifially and sufficiently well defined. The word â€?Bowery,â€?as used, is a sufficient indication of the place where the alleged offense was committed, and the omission of the words â€?in the â€?can have no effect upon its validity.
The return of the commitment, in answer to the habeas cor-]>us, and the admission of the facts it contains by the failure to take issue thereon, presented a case upon which, we think, the court should have remanded the children. For that purpose the commitments should be regarded as final judgments under the' provisions of the habeas corpus act, and, being prima facie valid, the jurisdiction of the magistrate making the commitment is the only question 2Uâ€™esented to the justice at Special Term for revievV. But, assuming that the court had authority to go behind the commitments, regular on their face and showing such facts as gave the magistrates jurisdictioh, nothing was bought up by the writ of certiorari that would justify interference with the conviction. The clerk of the court returned the only record of the case' then on file in that court. The testimony on which the conviction was had may well have been taken orally by the court, and it must be assumed that it was sufficient to justify the commitment where the question arises in the present form. The 2>urpose of the writ of habeas corpus is not to review trials before a magistrate on questions of that character. . Where that is the intention, other process is provided by law under which an appellate court may 2>ass upon the sufficiency of the evidence before the magistrate and the correctness of his decisions. '
It is the duty of the magistrate to observe with great care the provisions of the several statutes in such cases, and to see that their records are properly made, and the certificate of conviction duly filed, and that their warrants of commitment are in due form. Section 4 of chapter 359. of the Laws of 1873, which relates to commitments to the House of Eefuge, provides in very general terms a remedy for the failure to file certificates, and for any irregularities, misdescriptions, defects or imperfections in the proceedings, where persons are committed to the House of Eefuge; and -this section would require, if there were any defect or imperfection in matters of form, that fit be corrected by order of the court before which the writ of habeas corpus was returnable.
The order of the court below should be reversed, and the writ discharged, and the children remanded.

1164502,"PEOPLE, ex rel. DOUGLASS v. NAEHR",1883-09,"Pratt, J.
The relator has been adjudged a disorderly person, in that he abandoned, neglected and refused to support his wife, within the meaning of chapter 395, Laws of 1870, and as amended by chapter 171, Laws of 1882. This statute relates to the county of Kings. Its material provisions are as follows: â€?All persons who abandon or threaten to- run away and leave their wives and children, or either of them, without adequate support, a burden on the public, or who shall leave them in danger of becoming a burden on the public, or who shall neglect to provide for them according to their means, against whom a warrant shall be issued upon a complaint made upon oath to any justice of the peace or police justice in the county of Kings, shall be brought before the justice of the peace or police justice who issued said warrant, and if it shall appear by the confession of the offender or by competent testimony that the person so charged is guilty, the justice of the peace or police justice before whom the said offender is brought shall make an order in which he shall specify the sum of money to be paid weekly by said person for the support of the wife or children, or either.â€?It seems that while the relator and his wife were living together in Hew York city a quarrel arose, and that she left him, and came to reside with their daughter, in Brooklyn, where she has ever since lived. He remained in Hew York for a time, and then went to Hew Jersey. He contributed to her support to some extent from time to time, and finally came to Brooklyn, where he now resides. She at last complained to the commissioners of charities,, one of whom presented this charge against the relator.
The judgment recites that the conviction was in part upon his own confession as well as upon the evidence, but the proceedings upon the trial are all returned under the certiorari, and the question arises whether or not this charge was fairly established by the proofs.
It is obvious that the wife had the opinion that the relator had been unfaithful to her, and that she had determined to live with him no more. Before leaving Hew York'he offered to provide a separate house for her in that city, but this she refused. The extent of the relatorâ€™s means was not very clearly shown, but he had 'offered to do something by way of contributing to her support after he came to live in Brooklyn.
The determination of the questions of fact raised by the relator involves a careful consideration of the object of the statute, and the nature and degree of proof required in the proceedings under it. The statute was designed to protect the public against the burden of supporting wives and children when their husband, without just cause, neglected or refused to perform their legal obligations in that regard. It was not intended to give the wife any new remedy, either directly or indirectly. Bayne v. People, 14 Hun, 181. Interpreted literally, it might seem to warrant a conviction when the husband, possessed of proper means, for any cause refused to support his wife. We do not think, however, such could have been the legislative intent. It authorizes a criminal proceeding, and declares that to be a crime which was not theretofore punishable as an offense. It must therefore be strictly construed with reference to the object in view and the general policy of the law existing at the time it was passed. We do not think it imposed any new duty upon a husband toward his wire. It simply declares that unreasonable neglect, or refusal to perform certain existing obligations, in cases when such conduct will result in imposing a burden upon the public, shall be punishable as a crime. Any other view would result in a most serious disturbance of the reciprocal rights and duties which are founded upon the marital relation.
The wife is entitled to reasonable support by the husband. It is her duty as well as right to live with him in such proper place as he provides. He is entitled to determine not only the place, but their style of living, and it is her plain duty to follow him wherever his interest, necessity, or reasonable wish, may lead. It is only when he neglects or refuses to properly provide, or maltreats her, or is guilty of infidelity to her, that she is justified in refusing her submission to his reasonable requirement in this respect.
Then, as general fundamental rules, they are of such importance to the public weal that courts will most jealously guard and enforce them, and every new piece of legislation affecting them has always received strict construction, even as between the parties directly interested. It is our duty to construe this act in aid rather than in hostility to these rules. In this view, it is difficult to find in this act anything more than authority for a criminal proceeding against the husband who so unreasonably neglects or refuses to perform existing legal obligations towards his wife that she has become or is likely to become a public burden. Neither was this statute intended to apply to a case where a wife capriciously and without cause refuses to accept reasonable provision for her support at the place which the husband may have selected, even though she is liable to become a public burden.
The questions here must be tested, not alone by the measure of the relatorâ€™s pecuniary ability, but by the conduct of the wife and his disposition to recognize his pecuniary obligations to her. Is her want of support due to his refusal to provide for her, or to her unwillingness to perform the duties of a wife and live with him % She testified that she was unwilling to live with him. This refusal was not justified by any legal proof in the case of infidelity or cruelty upon his part. If there is any foundation for the suggestion that relator has committed adultery, the wife has an ample remedy in a suit for divorce and alimony.
When we look into the case for proof of a refusal to provide, we find nothing but an original demand for a separate maintenance on the part of the wife. This part of the case is bare of that certainty of demonstration that overcomes all reasonable doubtâ€”which distinguishes the criminal from a civil proceeding.
A careful reading of the case cannot fail to impress upon the mind the belief that the conviction was obtained through an erroneous view of the object and scope of the statute. According to our view of the statute, there is an utter failure to make out a case to warrant a conviction of the offense charged.
The judgment should be reversed.

1164504,"CARNCROSS, et al. v. PEOPLE",1883-06,"Hardin, J.
Section 5, 3 R. S. 2483 (7th ed.), contains .the language under which the plaintiffs in error were indicted, as principal and accessory before the fact; and upon the indictment found under that section their conviction was had. By that section, the burning of any building â€?which shall be at that time insured against loss or damage by fire, with intent to prejudice such insurance . . .â€?shall be arson in the third degree. Facts which show that the accused is brought within the terms of the statute must be alleged in the indictment. Dedieu v. People, 22 N. Y. 180.
The acts which are charged as constituting the offense must be charged with such- certainty as to identify aiid distinguish it from other transactions, and that the prisoner may know what crime he is called upon to answer. People v. Taylor, 3 Den. 91. â€?In the first and fourth courts of the indictment before us, the felonious burning of a dwelling-house is averred, â€?being then and there, to wit, at the time of such burning, insured against loss or damage by fire in and by the Fire Association of Philadelphia, the same being a corporation duly organized, and empowered to take and issue such insurance, with intent to injure, prejudice and defraud said Fire Association against the form of the statute . . .â€?We think the indictment sufficient to admit proof of the facts required by the statute to make out the crimeâ€”first, the burning of the building ; second, that the building was insured against loss by fire; third, the intent to prejudice such' insurer. The case differs from People v. Henderson (1 Park. 563), as in that case the intent to defraud the Poughkeepsie Mutual Insurance was averred, but it was not averred that the house burned was insured. It is clear that the indictment before us alleges a corporation duly organized, and empowered to take insurance, and that it was that corporation the prisoners intended to prejudice and injure. In Cohen v. People (5 Park. 330), the indictment, after stating the corporation injured, said, viz.: â€?A corporation created by and existing under the laws of the State of Massachusetts.â€?The objection, which was sustained by the court, was that there was no evidence proving the existence of the corporation alleged.
The statute under which this indictment was found aims to punish offenses against all insurers, and is not limited to such as are natural persons, or organized under the laws of the state and we think where the insurer is named, be it an individual or a corporation,, the proof of his residence, or the mode of its incorporation or manner of coming into existence may be shown, although not specifically averred in the indictment. People v. Stearns, 21 Wend. 423; affâ€™d 23 Id. 634; People v. Jackson, 8 Barb. 642 ; Mackesey v. People, 6 Park. 119.
The act of incorporation of the insurance company, with proof of user under it, was sufficient to establish the existence of the corporation. People v. Beigler, Lalor's Sup. 133 ; Johnson v. People, 4 Ben. 367. The cÃ¡se of McGary v. People (45 N. Y. 153) was where the name was erroneously stated in referring to a corporation, and the variance was held fatal, and nothing in that case conflicts with what has already been said by us.
Second. It was not error to receive proof that the Fire Association had complied with the laws of the state, and was authorized to transact business in this state. It was a fact tending to show the validity of the insurance.
Third. The fire was on February 19, 1879, and Clark says, a. few days before it occurred an agreement was come to between him and Carncross and Cota that the building should be rifled and burned; that Carncross would give each of them $200 for doing the job. The principal direct evidence tending to establish the conspiracy or plot to burn the building was given by Clark, the accomplice. The People called David. Carncross, who was a cousin of the defendant Carncross, who had had difficulty with him, and he was allowed to testify, against objection and exception, that in 1875, 1876, he had a conversation with defendant Carncross â€?in regard to putting a stock of furniture in â€?the building, and that defendant Carncross said â€?he thought it would be & profitable investment to put in furniture; he said â€?it could be bought very cheap in the rough, and be stained and varnished.â€?We had several conversations in regard to it. . . . He came in, one day, and said to me, â€?I will tell you how some money might be made,â€?(here was an objection and exception) and witness was allowed to say, viz. : â€?He said we might stock up this building with furniture, build up a good fire, and go a-visiting. I told him I thought it would hardly do. I donâ€™t remember anything further. I think this was in April, 1875.â€?We think this evidence was worse than immaterial; it tended to injure the defendants before the jury, and to prejudice them against the defendants. It violated the rule which excludes from the jury evidence of a crime, or proposition for the commission of a crime, other than the one named in the indictment. To receive it was error. Rosenweig v. People, 6 Lans. 462 ; People v. Kennedy, 32 N. Y. 144 ; People v. Dibble, 5 Park. 28 ; People v. Corbin, 56 N. Y. 363 ; People v. Coleman, 55 Ib. 81; Copperman v. People, 56 Ib. 591; People v. Brown, 72 Ib. 571; People v. Crapo, 76 Ib. 291. If the conversation had been after the confederation sworn to by Clark had been made, a very different question would have been presented.
There should be a new trial. The conviction and judgment should be reversed.
Fourth. As a new trial must be had because of the error occurring upon the trial, it is not necessary to examine the motion for a new trial or newly discovered evidence.
Conviction order and judgment reversed, and proceedings remitted to the Court of Sessions of Wayne County, with direction for a new trial.

1164444,PEOPLE v. BURLEIGH,1883-01,"Bockes, J.
The arrest conviction and sentenco of the defendant in this case were in all respects strictly in accordance with section 17 of chapter 628 of the Laws of 1857, as amended by section 2 of chapter 856 of the Laws of 1869, except as to the alleged error of the magistrate in' refusing the demand for a jury trial before that officer.
Intoxication in a public place is, by the act referred to, declared an offense punishable by law, and provision is made for the arrest, trial, conviction and sentence of such offender. The mode of procedure is declared with particularity. The offender may be arrested without warrant, and the trial is made summary by and before the magistrate on whom jurisdiction is conferred. That officer is required, under penalty for refusal, forthwith to try the person charged with the offense, with no right of bail ' for his appearance at the Oyer and Terminer or Sessions, and sentence at once follows conviction. Thus it is seen that the entire proceeding for the punishment of the offense, is made special and exceptional. The disgusting character of the act, and its immoral tendency, make it a very proper subject for summary disposition and speedy punishment without the usual formalities provided by law in dealing with ordinary but less repulsive matters of public offense. But it is insisted that the provisions of this law are superseded and repealed by the Oode of Criminal Procedure; that proceedings for the punishment of the offense of public intoxication must now be taken under and pursuant of the Code, and we are cited to subdivision 12 of section 56 and to sections 58 and 211 (amended by Laws of 1882, chap. 360) in support of this claim. On referring to these sections it will be seen that courts of special sessions are authorized with some exceptions, unnecessary here to notice, to hear and determine charges for â€œoffenses against the laws relating to excise and the regulation of taverns, inns and hotelsâ€?(sub. 12, sec. 56); and that in the cases so designated, the person charged has the right to give bail for his appearance at the next succeeding court having authority to inquire, by the intervention of a grand jury, into the offense (sec. 58, 211). The inquiry now arises, do these or any other provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, supersede or repeal the act of 1857, as amended by the act of 1869, in so far as they relate to the offense of public intoxication? We are of the opinion that this question must be answered in the negative. We are not cited to any express provision of law declaring such repeal; nor have we been able to find any such repealing statute. If the provisions referred to be superseded or repealed, it must be by implication only. But a repeal by implication is not favored by the courts, and will not be allowed save from the necessity of the case Mongeon v. People, 55 N. Y. 616; Hankins v. Mayor, 64 N. Y. 22; People ex rel. Robinson v. Supervisors, 17 Hun, 505 ;f and the controlling question in such case is whether the statutes are inconsistent with or repugnant to each other, whether both can stand and be enforced without conflict, as regards the offense declared or the proceedings for their separate enforcement. As stated in Hankins v. Mayor (supra), â€?the rule is, that a statute only operates as a repeal of a former one to the extent that the two are repugnant; if both can stand, and to the extent that they can stand and have effect, they will both have effect.â€?Again, if it be admitted that the offense of public intoxication is germain to the subject of â€?excise â€?the question still remains whether it falls within the provisions of subdivision 12 of section 56 above cited, which speaks of â€?offenses against the laws relating to excise.â€?A general law will not be deemed to repeal a special law relating to a particular subject unless the intent to effect that result is clearly manifest. Matter of Delaware & Hudson Canal Co., 69 N. Y. 209; Hankins v. Mayor, 64 N. Y. 21, 22; Smith v. People, 47 N. Y. 330 ; Mayor v. Hart, 16 Hun, 387; People ex rel. Bobinson v. Supervisors, 17 Hun, 505. Ho such intent is here apparent, nor, as we think, can such intent be deemed probable in view of the nature of the offense, and of the special provisions made for its punishment. Ho direct reference is made in the Code to this offense, which as may fairly be supposed, would have been the case, had it been intended to bring such offense within its provisions. Should it not rather be inferred that the ordinary subject of excise, to wit: the regulating of the sale of intoxicating liquors by license and the imposition of fines, penalties and forfeitures because of prohibited and illegal sales of such liquors, were alone intended by the phrase â€?offenses against the laws relating to excise? â€?Public intoxication is quite a different matter from fines, penalties and forfeitures declared against prohibited and illegal sales of ardent spirits, although, as above suggested, germain to the subject of excise. This offense, too, is given particular significance under a special statute where its manner of punishment is expressly and solely provided for. In one sense it is collateral to the general subject of excise. We do not think it was intended that it should be brought within the purview of a general law having direct reference to other matters, when by sucli construction the particular offense would generally pass without summary and speedy rebuke. We are, therefore, led to .the conclusion that the provisions of the act of 1857, as amended by the act of 1889, relating to the offense of public intoxication and its punishment, remain in full force and effect as regards the'question of the repeal. Those provisions, as we think, stand to be enforced, not by- a court of Special Sessions, but by-the magistrate before whom the offender shall be brought according to law, the same since the Code went into effect as prior to that time.
It is however urged that the provisions of law above referred to, and under which the defendant was convicted, are repugnant to the constitution and void, because the accused is thereby deprived of the right of trial by a. common law jury after indictment. We are of the opinion that this position is untenable. It is claimed, and it may be admitted, that public intoxication was an offense at common law, that is, that the offender might be proceeded against criminally as a disorderly person ; but was he entitled, under the constitution, which provides that the trial J)y jury in all cases ""in which it has been heretofore used shall remain inviolate forever (art. 1., sec. 2), to demand and have a trial by .common law jury ? It was decided in People v. Justices 74 N. Y. 406, that this constitutional provision did not apply to the petty offenses triable before a court of Special Sessions. The learned judge in giving the opinion of the court in that case, says â€?no jury was permitted in those cases until 1824, when the legislature provided for a jury of six to be selected from twelve to be drawn, if demanded by the accused, and this is the law throughout the State.â€?In People v. Putnam, 3 Park. 386, 388, Judge Pratt says â€?there was always a class of persons or offenders, who from the commencement of the government have been accustomed to bÃ© dealt with summarily before inferior magistrates and to whom the right of trial by jury has not been granted. These were classed under the head of vagrants and disorderly persons. Among the latter, by the Pevised Statutes, were classed drunkards. Persons found intoxicated â–?in the public streets and places of the city might therefore well be classed in the same category, and provisions be made for their summary conviction and punishment,â€?and the learned judge further says â€?I may premise in the first place that there is no constitutional difficulty in the way of making this offense (public intoxication) punishable summarily.â€?This decision was prior to the amendment of 1869, which amendment cured the defect pointed out by Judge Pratt as existing in the act of 1857, and deplored by him (See page 390). The decision in People v. McCarthy (45 How. 97), is to the same effect as those above cited. Judge Davis here says â€?Both in England and in this state long prior to the earliest of our state constitutions, vagrants and disorderly persons, as defined by statute, were made subject to summary trials without jury and frequently from time to time, in both countries, additions have been made by statute to the classes known as disorderly persons, with provisions subjecting them to arrest and trial in the same form; â€?and he adds, â€?there can be no question in view of the statutes and authorities that trial by jury had, before the constitution, never been used in the disposition of vagrants and disorderly persons, and consequently was not intended for such persons, so far as they were defined by the then existing legislation. That the legislature has power to enlarge the class of persons to be affected by laws against disorderly persons and to be summarily tried by the magistrates of the state, seems to be well settled by the authorities above cited.â€?To those authorities referred to by Judge Davis, and particularly to the case of Byers v. Commonwealth 42 Penn. St. 89, attention is here invited. See also remarks of Judge Wright in Board of Excise v. Barrie (34 N. Y. 668, 669). Without further examination of authorities we must hold that the provisions of law here challenged are not obnoxious to the charge of unconstitutionality.
The question still remains whether the defendant had the right of trial before the magistrate with a jury of six. This right was denied him. The constitutional provision above considered does not touch this question as that provision relates, and has application only to the right of trial by a common law jury of twelve.
Mow, on recurring to the law as amended in 1869, it will be observed that the right of trial by a jury of six is not taken away in express terms; and it is insisted that the right therefore remains in accordance with the practice observable on the trial of offenders in courts of Special Sessions. But the very manifest intent of the law is that the trial should be had by the magistrate without jury. It is made the duty of the magistrate forthwith to try the offender, and upon his conviction by that officer, sentence must be pronounced. The fair reading of the act is to the effect that the entire proceeding shall be had by the magistrate. To him is given exclusive jurisdiction to examine, to try, and to convict. The entire proceeding is made special. Special jurisdiction is conferred to be exercised summarily, as above suggested, without the usual formal proceedings necessary to be observed on complaints and trials in courts of Special Sessions. In this respect the case differs from People v. Baird (11 Hun, 289), where the city judge was authorized to hold courts of Special Sessions writh all the powers a,nd jurisdiction of such courts as regulated by statute; and from People v. James (16 Hun, 426), where it was held that the police justice, acting as a court of Special Sessions, was governed by all statutory provisions applicable to those courts generally, except as was otherwise provided. The decision in Hill v. People, 20 N. Y. 363, was made before the amendment of 1869, and must be construed in the light of the cases hereinabove, cited.
We are of the opinion that the record in this case is free from error, hence that the judgment of the Sessions affirming the conviction and sentence of the defendant by the magistrate must be affirmed.
Mem. The question whether an appeal was authorized in this case, from the judgment of the magistrate to the Court of Sessions, was not raised on the argument in this case, hence we have not considered it here. But had we here examined this question and reached the conclusion that the appeal to the Sessions was without authority of law, the result would have been practically the same, as we now affirm the judgment. If, without authority, then the proceeding and judgment in the Court of Sessions were without jurisdiction, and while we would be compelled to reverse the judgment of Sessions, we should also have dismissed the appeal to that Court, in which case the judgment by and before the magistrate would remain in force. On the question of the authority to appeal to the Sessions see People v. Trumble (1 JV.Y. Orim. Rep. 443), decided at this term, wherein this subject was examined.

1164459,PEOPLE v. DOWLING,1884-01,"Learned, J.
The indictment is for murder, alleged to have been committed in 1878, and was found, September 15, 1883. By section 719 of the Penal Code, the offense must be punished according to the law existing when it was done ; and the provisions of that Code do not apply. Section 9G2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, shows that that Code applies simply to procedure. I see, therefore, nothing objectionable in the indictment.
The prisonersâ€?counsel moves for their discharge, on the grounds : First, that there is no evidence to show the death of Truax; second, that there is no evidence shown how he lost his life; third, that there is no evidence showing what degree of murder (if any) was committed.
I am of opinion that there is evidence for the jury on each of these points. I do not specify it, lest I should prejudice the defendants.
The counsel for the prisoners requests that the jury be charged, that under this indictment, and under the constitution and laws (whatever be the evidence), there can be no conviction except for murder, for the following reasons ;
That the crime is alleged to have been committed in June, 1878; that the indictment was found in September, 1883; that under 2 R. S., on p. 726, sec. 37, as amended by chap. 630, Laws 1873, while an indictment for murder may be found at any time after the death, other indictments must be found within five years; that, therefore, as the defendants could not have been lawfully indicted in September, 1883, for manslaughter alleged to have been committed in June, 1878, they cannot be convicted of such crime under an indictment for murder; notwithstanding the general statute. 2 R. S. p. 702, sec. 27.
This undoubtedly presents an important question and one on which no decisions are found in this state.
The position taken by the prisonersâ€?counsel may seem to be within the equity of the statute. It may be said that if the prisoners could not have been indicted for manslaughter in September, 1883, it would be unjust that they should be convicted of that crime upon an indictment then found; that the statute might be evaded by procuring an indictment for murder against persons who were guilty only of manslaughter.
But I think I am bound to take the strict language of the statute, and that I have no right to extend it by implication. That statute limited simply the time for finding indictments. Along with that statute stood the section last quoted, that upon an indictment for any offense consisting bf different degrees, the jury may find the accused guilty of any degree of such offense inferior to that charged, or of an attempt to commit such offense. I do not think I have a right, by construction, to interpolate into that section, 27, the words â€?if such indictment be found within the time prescribed for such inferior degree.â€?It will be noticed that section 27 also authorizes the finding the accused guilty of an attempt, etc, etc. There are special provisions for punishing attempts. 2 R. 8. p. 698, sec. 3. Could the court assume to say that under this section 27, on an indictment for murder, whenever found, the jury might not convict of an attempt?
Perhaps the law should be amended to conform to the views of the prisonersâ€?counsel. But I must follow it as it is. One case cited by the district attorney, that of"" Clark v. State (12 Georgia, 350), appears to be exactly analogous, and to sustain the view I take. I shall, therefore, decline to charge that (if the evidence should justify) the jury have no right to find the prisoners guilty of any crime but murder on this indictment. Whether the evidence is such as to prove any other crime, is a very different question.
The district attorney urges that chapter 160, Laws of 1838, section 1, makes (what I may call) train wrecking a felony. That under section 445, Code of Criminal Procedure, the defendants may be found guilty of that crime on the ground that it is necessarily included in that with which the defendants are charged in the indictment. Section two of said chapter 160, provides that the previous section shall not extend to cases where death to a human being shall result from the commission of either of the offenses. Plainly, this intended to leave the crime, in such cases, to stand on the statute defining the second case of murder in the second degree, viz., homicide perpetrated by an act imminently dangerous, etc. Chapter 333, Laws of 1876.
I do not think that, on this indictment, the prisoners can be convicted of the crime of train wrecking under chapter 160, Laws of 1838.
Note.â€”The case of Clark v. People (12 Ga. 350), referred to in thÃ© foregoing opinion, was a trial upon an indictment for assault with intent to murder. The defendant was found guilty of an assault and battery only.
At the time of the finding of the indictment the statute of limitation's had run against a charge of assault and battery, but not against assault with intent to murder.
The court in answer to the motion in arrest of judgment on the ground that a prosecution for the offense of assault and battery was barred by the statute of limitations, said â€œThe statute applies to the indictment on which the defendant was arraigned and tried, and not to the minor grade of offense, for which he might be found guilty on the trial for the higher grade of crime, for which the grand jury accused him.â€?
1164448,PEOPLE v. HALE,1883-12,Bockes", J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The point is taken that the first verdict was, in legal effect, a verdict of acquittal, and this, whether it be deemed to be a general or a special verdict; that in either case, there ' was an express finding against the commission of a crime, which, in assault and battery, necessarily involves a criminal intent, an intent'to commit an act of violence upon another, by way of injury and insult, one or both, productive of a breach of the peace. The act complained of was the taking hold of the arm of a young woman, Miss Dewar, when walking in the street with others, her associates, male and female. The- defendant and Miss Dewar were acquaintances, and to the time of the occurrence, held friendly relations with each other. Miss Dewar and Mr. Crutchley, with whom she was walking, and who it seems was not on friendly terms with the defendant, testified that the defendant violently seized hold of her arm ; whereas two others, disinterested witnesses, who were present, put the act more mildly, saying that they saw him take hold of Miss Dewarâ€™s arm; and the defendant, not denying that he took hold of Miss Dewarâ€™s arm, testified that â€?it was not with the intent, to assault or insult her,â€?on this proof, the jury rendered their verdict; and it was for the jury to say which version of the transaction should be adopted as the true one. The jury had the right to conclude, especially in view of the former friendly relations which had existed between the defendant and Miss Dewar, undisturbed until Mr. Crutchley came between them, that the defendant simply took hold of Miss Dewarâ€™s arm," with no â€?intent to assault or insult her;â€?and the jury did so find that the taking hold of Miss Dewarâ€™s arm was not a â€?criminal assaultâ€?or with â€œintent to injure.â€?The verdict was â€?not guilty of a criminal assault or intent to injure.â€?""""Was not this verdict a perfect acquittal ? If the assault was not criminal", there was no crime. The jury found the defendant not guilty of a criminal assault; that is, they found that the defendant took hold of Miss Dewarâ€™s arm, but with no criminal intent. This was good as a special verdict, which need, not be in any particular form, if it presents intelligently the' facts found by the jury. Code Crim. Pro. Â§.440. It was a finding of the facts. It presented the conclusions of fact as established by the evidence, as construed by the jury. Code Crim. Pro. Â§ 438. It was not an imperfect or defective verdict, but covered the entire case; nor did it contain any suggestion of mistake, so People v. Bush (3 Park. 552); Nelson, v. People (5 lb. 39); and People v. Graves (5 lb. 134), have no application. The defendant was charged with Ã¡ criminal act. The jury found that the act on which crime was predicated, was not criminal; and they might so find, if they found the facts to be as claimed and proved on the part of the defendant. What are the constitnents of the crime of assault and battery? It has been tersely laid down, as follows: â€?An act done, with criminal intent and injury to the public or disturbance of the public peace.â€?It should be held in mind that we are considering the case of an alleged crime, not the right of private action for damages because of a trespass upon the person, in which case intention is not material except on the question of damages. Here we are treating with the subject of crime; so to make the act criminal, it must be committed with criminal intent; an actâ€”an assaultâ€?without such.intent, does not constitute a crime. Greenleaf says, the intention to do harm is of the essence of an assault; and again, in the case of a mere assault, the quo animo is material ; and again, it is said, the law judges not only of the act done, but of the intent with which it is done; thus, to make an act criminal, there must be vicious intention and criminal design. Infants, idiots, and persons of unsound mind, are held to be irresponsible for their acts, otherwise criminal, because incapable of felonious or criminal intent. Lord Kenyon, speaking upon this subject, says the intention and the act must both concur to constitute the crime. Inâ€?Hays v'. People (1 Hill, 351), the intent was looked upon as necessary to the offense; so it is said in Russell on Crimes, that whether the act shall amount to an assault, must in every case be collected from the intention, citing the remark approvingly that it is the quo animo which constituted an assault, which was a matter to be left to the jury, as above suggested. We are here considering the subject in its criminal aspect, not as in personal actions of trespass vi et armis. Then has a crime been committed % Was there culpability, vicious intention, criminal design, designed disturbance of the public peace ? The jury found, and so rendered their verdict, that the defendant was not guilty in this regardâ€”that the act complained of was not a criminal act, did not involve any element' essential to crime. They had the right to find," if they deemed"""" the facts proved to justify the finding", that the taking hold a personâ€™s arm, in the confidence of existing friendship, trusting to a license acquired by a supposed mutual kind feeling, doing no injury, with no intent to do a wrong, by insult or otherwise, is not a criminal act. Such an act is an innocent one, in the sense that it does not constitute a crime. It is, too, of some significance, as bearing on the legal views above expressed, that the act remained uncomplained of for four months, and', as counsel stated on the argumentâ€”and this was not disputed,â€?until after trouble had arisen between the defendant and Crutchley, with whom Miss Dewar was walking at the time of the occurrence.
Again, the record, as it now stands, presents a strange anomaly. It contains two verdicts, one not guilty; the other, guilty. The first verdict was not taken back by the jury; nor was the second one an amendment of the first. Each was perfect of itself, not defective or suggestive of mistake; the first, being complete of itself, and declaring that the act complained of was not criminal, that the defendant was not guilty of crime in doing it,â€”should have been accepted as final. It follows that the judgment pronounced by the police court was erroneous. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to examine other questions raised on the appeal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1164473,PEOPLE v. SPEAR,1883-12,"Vann, J.
On November 25, 1882, the defendant was arrested upon a warrant charging him with the crime of procuring an abortion upon one Eliza Lawrence, which resulted in her death. He waived an examination and gave bail in the sum of $10,000 for his appearance, if the grand jury should find an indictment against him. The undertaking was signed by his wife, Alice F. Spear, and by his son-in-law, Abram Smith, as sureties. On February 3, 1883, the grand jury presented to this court a true bill against the defendant, for said crime. A bench warrant was thereupon issued for his arrest, but he had fled to Canada and has not since been within the state. The bond was promptly forfeited, and suit was brought against the sureties. Mrs. Spear, who had previously indemnified her co-surety against loss on account of signing said bond, deposited with the county treasurer ample security for the payment of the entire sum called for by the undertaking, and then caused this motion to be made for the remission of the whole or a part of the penalty. In her affidavit she alleges that she is the wife of the defendant and had lived with him since 1848, until his departure; that she is sixty-two years of age, has been in poor health for many years, and was so depressed by the charge against her husband as to become sick and confined to her bed for some months; that her husband assured her of his innocence, and she believed him when she signed his bond; that she could not avoid sympathizing with him, who was her husband and the father of her children; that she had no suspicion that he would run away and no thought of protecting him from the consequences of any crime; that she was greatly surprised when he disappeared and has no knowledge of his whereabouts; that she had advanced $3,000 to her husband to be used in his defense, and has no information as to the purposes for which such money was actually expended; that she formerly had considerable property in her own right, which came to her through a deceased brother, but that she is now worth not to exceed the sum of $20,000, or $22,000, over and above her debts; that she is unable to do any work for the support of herself or children; that her five children, whose ages do not appear, are scattered, engaged in various employments; that she has secured to the county of Oneida the payment of the whole amount of said bond, in case it shall be exacted, and now throws herself upon the mercy of the court and asks to be relieved from a part at least of the penalty.
According to the papers read in opposition by the district attorney, a case of great strength and aggravation was made out against the defendant before the grand jury. An affidavit, made upon information and belief only, was also read, tending to show that the defendantâ€™s departure was known to and connived at by Mrs. Spear. The persons who furnished this information refused to make an affidavit. Statements sworn to upon information and belief cannot be received as proof of any fact, but they may furnish good ground for a reference, so that the persons refusing to make affidavit can be compelled to be sworn. -No reference, however, is necessary, as this motion can be safely decided upon the case presented by Mrs. Spear, assuming all of her allegations to be true.
It is provided by section 597 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that after the forfeiture of an undertaking given by a person for his appearance to answer a charge of crime to be preferred against him, the court directing the forfeiture, or the county court of the county, may remit th6 forfeiture, or any part thereof, upon such terms as are just. The next section provides for a notice of at least five days to the district attorney of the county; for service upon him of copies of the affidavits and papers upon which the application is founded, and enacts that the motion can be granted only upon payment of the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings for the enforcement of the forfeiture. These are the Only provisions of law upon the subject to which my attention has been called.
It is obvious that this statute clothes the court with a wide discretion. Formerly, power was given to the county court to remit any fine, forfeiture or recognizance â€?upon good cause shown,â€?and upon such terms as to the court should appear just and equitable. 3 R. S. 6th ed. 773, Â§ 38; Code of Procedure, Â§ 30, subd. 12; L. 1818, 307, Â§ 8. But the present statute, which is new, seems to make the discretion almost absolute, for it fails to require, at least expressly, even that the court should act upon good cause shown. Such a power should be discreetly used. It cannot be that the Legislature intended it should be exercised according to caprice or sentiment, but that it should be based upon some principle, that would best promote the welfare of the public, including as a part thereof the sufferers by the forfeiture. On the one hand due regard should be had to the effect of the precedent, as it tends to encourage or repress crime and on the other to see that no case of extreme hardship occurs that will cause destitution to a family, deprive children of support and education, or creditors of their just debts. The case under consideration is not one of extreme hardship. A lady of respectability,'in poor health, and somewhat advanced in years, is suddenly deprived of nearly half her fortune, but is still left with means for a comfortable support. She is entitled to sympathy in her misfortune, and the strength and weakness of her position in that sympathy is all it has to rest upon. That is not enough.
A person who is, upon this motion, presumed to be guilty of an atrocious crime, has fled from justice and cannot be brought to punishment. The one who is presumed to have known him best and to have had the greatest interest in his escape from punishment had become surety for his appearance and â–?had promised, in effect, to produce him when wanted, or pay Â§10,000. She does not produce him, but asks relief from the penalty. If the court yields to sympathy and grants the petition, what effect will its action have ? So far as the act can speak, it will say to criminals under bail, â€œrun away and leave your sureties to trust to the sympathy of the public and the courts for relief.â€?The interest of the people requires that a sterner rule should prevail. That rule should require sureties to produce their prisoner or pay the bond. That should be the rule, and the exception should be to remit the forfeiture only in a case of extreme hardship.
Aside from the sympathy which it is natiual that one should feel for the person upon whom the loss must fall, what reason is there for remitting this forfeiture ? 'Because the penalty of the bond was too large ? But it-was not large enough to secure the attendance of the accused, which was its only object. Because, as it is claimed, it has not been customary to enforce such bonds ? Perhaps if a different custom had prevailed the defendant would now be here for trial and punishment. Because the surety needs the money and the people do not need it ? But the people do need this money, if they are fairly entitled to it, as they expend each year large sums to detect, punish and prevent crime. Moreover, this argument would apply to almost every ease with as much'force, and to yield to it would make the giving of bail in a criminal action a mere form without real meaning. Because the forfeiture punishes the innocent and does not punish the guilty % The payment of the bond is only the discharge of a legal obligation, voluntarily assumed, and cannot be regarded as a punishment of the surety. While it may not punish the guilty, its tendency is to cause him to appear, as in that event the forfeiture would doubtless be remitted, and the money, even if paid, restored. Certainly the remission of the penalty cannot induce the defendant to appear.
While the only proof produced by the surety upon this application is her own affidavit, of -which an analysis has already been given, there was also presented a petition signed by a large number of leading tax-payers and representative men of the county of Oneida, asking that the forfeiture be reduced to an amount not exceeding $5,000 and the costs of suit. At the head of this petition stands the name of one of my honored predecessors in office, who for many years presided with dignity and ability over this court. Such a petition cannot be lightly disregarded. I have carefully considered it. While it raises no doubt in my mind as to what my duty is, it does cause embarrassment in the discharge of that duty. But the importance of the precedent must prevail, even over such a petition. This decision, so far as it has force as an example, must either tend to looseness in the administration of justice or to the strict enforcement of law. I intend it to mean that the signing of a bail bond in a criminal case requires the production of the prisoner or the payment of the bond; that this- rule should only be relaxed, in exceptional cases of extreme hardship; that sympathy for the misfortune of a surety is not a valid reason for relaxing the rule; and that even the petition of many leading citizens, which alleges no fact to guide the action of the court, except their sympathy for the unfortunate surety, is not a sufficient reason for remitting the penalty.

1164490,PEOPLE v. POUCHER,1883-10,"Hardin, J.
Inasmuch as the jury found a verdict of guilty, the prisoner was convicted of grand larceny, and sentenced for such offense, as for the offense of grand larceny in the second degree, section 534 of the Penal Code. Therefore, it is important to inquire whether the conviction of the defendant of grand larceny in the second degree, was regular and in accordance with law.
The indictment charged the defendant â–?with obtaining one ring of the value of $8, and certain coins. There was proof that,he obtained the ring, under.such circumstances as to bring the case within the provisions of section 528 of the Penal Code. There was no proof of obtaining the coin named and described in the indictment, or of any other coin, which would amount to more than $8.25. There was, therefore, no proof of obtaining the things named in the indictment, of a value beyond $8.25, and hence the proof sustained the indictment only to the extent named, and that valuation would carry the degree of the defendantâ€™s crime within the definition of petit larceny.
But the respondents were allowed to substitute for the coin named another thing. They did not ask to make an amendment to the indictment which would change the description of the thing named. The name of the thing described in a general sense was coin; in a specific sense, eagle, half eagles, silver dollars. Mo proof was furnished that the name of the thing described was erroneous or imperfect.
But it turned out in proof that the defendant did not obtain the things named and that he did obtain currency, an entirely different thing. Section 293 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, has lodged with the court a new power in respect to indictments, and authorized their amendment in certain cases where there is a â€?variance between the allegation therein and the proof in respect to time, or in the name or description of any place, person, or thing.â€?. If there had been an erroneous description of the coins named in the indictment, doubtless the description might have been amended and been made to conform to the proof. But we do not see how one thing named, to wit, coin, can be stricken out, and another thing, to wit, currency, be substituted in place of the thing stricken out, under the guise of amending the description of the thing named.
In short, we are of the opinion that the section does not authorize an amendment of an indictment which charges the larceny of coin enumerated, by inserting an allegation of currency, or of â€?bank-bills, lawful money of the United States of a kind, number and denomination unknown, and upon a bank unknown.â€?Therefore we say the amendment was not warranted by sec-Â» tion 293 of the Criminal Code, and its allowance was error, prejudicial to the defendant. If the amendment had not been allowed, the grade of the offense would have been that of petit larceny; with the amendment allowed, the general verdict established an offense of the grade of grand larceny in the second degree.
Numerous other exceptions were taken in the course of the trial, which need not be examined, as we are of the opinion that a new trial should be granted for the error we have pointed out.
Judgment and conviction, and order amending the indictment, and the order denying a new trial reversed, and proceedings remitted to the Court of Sessions of Onondaga county, with directions for a new trial.

1164426,PEOPLE v. LANE,1883-08,"Upon the appeal to the General Term of the Supreme1 Court the following opinions were written.
Brady, J.
The appellant was convicted of robbery in the first degree. Upon the trial he was examined on his own behalf and denied positively the commission of the offense or any participation in it, and proved an alibi. Several witnesses called on his behalf alsoâ€?testified that, at the time of the commission of the robbery, he was at his sisterâ€™s residence, where he himself stated he was, and where he went to attend the festivities consequent upon a christening. In rebuttal the people called a police officer, who testified that he knew the general reputation of the defendant, that it was bad, and that he would not believe him under oath. The officer also testified as to the bad character of one of1 the witnesses examined on behalf of the appellant. Captain Petty was also called as a witness in reference to the reputation of the prisoner, and said it was bad. Ho other witnesses were examined on that subject by the people. Ho witnesses were called on behalf of the appellant in respect to his good character. After conviction a motion was made for a new trial under section 465 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, upon affidavits of persons .who were present, or in the vicinity, at the time the robbery was committed, and who are positive in stating that the appellant was not one of those engaged in it, as they distinctly saw all who were ; the affidavits showing the good character of the prisoner who-,, it may be here observed,, is but twenty-one years of age.
It appears from the affidavit of one of the affiants that he was in court during the trial expecting to be called as a witness as to the character of the defendant, but was not examined for some reason which he does not understand. Section 465 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to which reference has already been made, provides, by its seventh subdivision, that a new trial may be granted when it is made to appear by affidavit that upon another trial the defendant' can produce evidence such as, if before received, would probably have changed the verdict, if such evidence has been discovered since the trial, is not cumulative, and the failure to produce it on the trial was not due to want of diligence. The evidence as to the occurrence itself must be regarded as cumulative, and therefore not one of the elements indicated. The element of good character, however, as to which there was no evidence given on behalf of the appellant was not cumulative. See Hueber v. Rosevelt (7 Daly, 114).
This court held in the case of Clute v. Emmerich (12 Hun, 504), that the error of a counsel in admitting a paper to be immaterial, worked an injustice, and therefore a new trial should be granted. Hence there are two features of this case which commend themselves to the consideration of the court: the omission of counsel to call witnesses as to good character,.and the probable effect of such proof in answer to the evidence given by two witnesses -connected with the police department. The section of the Code provides for a case where a defendant could produce evidence such as, if before received, would probably have changed the verdict. It may be said with very great propriety that, considering the youth of the prisoner, his positive denial of the accusation against him and the evidence relating to the alibi, if he had superadded to that, evidence of good character given by persons of respectability, such proof would probably have changed the verdict. Assuming the counsel to have known of the presence of the witnesses for that purpose and that he omitted to call them, such omission should not act to the prejudice of the appellant.
Motions of this character are addressed to the discretion of â– the court, and each application must therefore depend upon its distinct characteristics and cannot be said to furnish a precedent. It is not intended by the view which is taken of the application made to the court below to encourage applications of this nature, or to establish as a general rule that the omission of counsel to call witnesses upon a vital point in the case shall find favor in applications for- a new trial. When, however, it is the conviction of the court of review that injustice has arisen from the incidents of the trial, and the application for a new trial is brought within the provisions of the Code, supra, a new trial will be granted without hesitation.
The learned recorder fully considered the motion and delivered an elaborate opinion, but the effect of the proof of good character, in response to the evidence on that subject given by the people, does not seem to have received particular consideration.
It is thought for these reasons that the administration of justice demands a new trial.
Ordered accordingly.
Daniels, J.
I agree to the conclusion of Hr. Justice Beady that there ought to be another trial of the indictment against the defendant. Upon the whole case as it is now presented, but which may be very materially changed on the oral examination of the witnesses, there is serious ground for doubt as to his guilt. That will be either removed or confirmed by another trial. And under the circumstances justice requires that it. should be ordered, for the doubt can be removed in no other way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164494,PEOPLE v. COURTNEY,1883-10,"Daniels, J.
The perjury was assigned in the indictment upon evidence which the defendant himself gave, upon the trial of an indictment against him for forgery. He was sworn as a witness on his own behalf, and he was asked whether he had been in the Eastern Penitentiary in the state of Pennsylvania, whether he had gone by any other name than that of Edward J. Courtney, and whether he had served a term of imprisonment in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. To each of which questions he answered in the negative. Evidence was given upon the present trial, very directly tending to establish the fact that the defendant served a term of imprisonment in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and it was substantially upon that he was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment in the State prison. At the conclusion of the case as it was presented by the people, and also after the defendant had given his evidence, the court was requested to advise the jury to acquit the defendant, upon the ground that the alleged false statements were immaterial, irrelevant, and in no way affecting the issue, and not the subject of indictment for perjury. These requests were denied and the defendant excepted, and such exceptions are now relied upon in support of the appeal. *
It is undoubtedly the law that the evidence assigned as perjury in an indictment, must be material to the cause in which it is given, but to satisfy this rule no specific degree of materiality can be required, neither is it necessary that the evidence should bear directly upon the issue which at the time is being tried. But for the purpose of subjecting the person giving it, when it may be willfully false, to punishment, for the crime of perjury, all that can be required is that it shall have some bearing, either direct or indirect upon the determination oÂ£ the controlling fact or facts in issue. And when a witness gives material evidence it is always important to ascertain Ã¡nd discover how much weight, or reliance, can be placed upon his testimony. Whatever may weaken or tend to discredit his evidence is important and material and necessarily affects the determination of the issue. Shepard v. Parker, 36 N. Y. 517.
If the testimony of the witness is unassailed by any discrediting circumstances, then it will obviously be attended with greater effect in the determination of the controversy, than it would be, if he should be shown to be a person unworthy of full credit. Whatever may tend to sustain or support a witness is, therefore, material to the issue, so far as it may increase the confidence to be placed in his statement. And, likewise, whatever may tend to discredit him, and in that manner to reduce the confidence his evidence may deserve, will materially affect the determination of the issue in controversy. Ho special degree of materiality to create the crime has been defined or required, but all that can be insisted upon, is that the evidence itself shall appear to have had some material bearing in the determination of the case, and whatever may tend to the discredit of the witness; giving material evidence, must be regarded as within this rule. In Reg. v. Overton, 2 Moody C. C. 263, it was held that everything was material that affects the credit of the witness. That every question on cross-examination that goes to the credit of the witness is material. The same point was further considered in Reg. v. Gibbons, 5 Law Times N. S. 805, 31 L. J. M. C. 98, and the rule, as it has already been stated, was repeated and sustained, and in Commonwealth v. Bonner, 97 Mass. 587, the same conclusion was declared. And in Commonwealth v. Pollard, 12 Met. 225, it was held generally that evidence which is circumstantially material, will be sufficient to sustain an indictment for perjury. And in State v. Lavalley, 9 Mo. 834, it was in terms declared by the court that all false oaths which are material upon any and every collateral issue, in the progress of a cause, are equally punishable as if taken upon the trial of the main issue. Id. 828. In Reg. v. Larey, 3 Car. & K. 26, the inquiry made of the witness was very similar to that presented by this case, and it was held to be a proper foundation for an indictment for perjury.
That such an inquiry as that which was made of the witness concerning his imprisonment in the Eastern Penitentiary of Pennsylvania was material to the credit of the witness, and for that reason could properly be made, was held in Real v. People, 42 N. Y. 270, 289-2. And the same view was taken of it in Commonwealth v. Bonner, supra. And that, in the judgment of all reflecting persons would be the effect of the answer if the witness had stated that he had been so confined in prison. For the inference from it would be that his confinement resulted because of his conviction of a criminal offense. And less credit would be due to the statement of such a person, than to those obtained from a witness who could not properly be charged with violation of the criminal laws. For all the purposes of the present case the evidence was material within the prevailing rule of law upon the subject, and as it was untruthfully and knowingly given, an indictment for perjury could lawfully be predicated upon it.
It was further urged in support of the appeal that chapter 678 of the Laws of 1869, under which the defendant was allowed to testify, was an unconstitutional exercise of legislative authority. This objection has been taken under that part of section 5, article 1 of the Constitution, which declares that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. But the statute by no construction of language requires the accused to be a witness against himself, but leaves i'e entirely optional with him, whether he will take the stand in that capacity or not. And it has guarded against the consequences of bis neglect to do so, by declaring that, the omission shall not create any presumption against him. In form, it has left the accused with the fullest possible liberty upon this subject. But it has been urged, notwithstanding this circumstance, that a moral coercion has been imposed upon him by the act under which he is obliged to become a witness for himself or to subject himself to the suspicions of guilt by reason of his omitting to do so, and the case of Ruloff v. People, 45 N. Y. 213, has been cited as sustaining this view. But while the policy of the act was there made the subject of adverse criticism by the court, it was not intended to hold that it violated this restraint of the constitution. It was considered impolitic for the reason that the failure of the accused to avail himself of the privilege secured by the statute, might lead the jury to believe him guilty. And there may be grounds in some cases for such a suspicion. But ordinarily no danger to the accused, as a matter of fact, arises out of this circumstance. For intelligent jurors will usually guard themselves against any presumption unfavorable to the accused, whenever their attention may be directed to the necessity of doing so. 'The act was passed as a favorable measure of legislation to persons accused of crime, and if it has generally failed to be productive of their acquittal, the fact is to be attributed not to the law, but to the statements * and demeanor of the party, when he may be called upon to give evidence in his own behalf. For if he is guilty of the charge made against him, some fact or circumstance will ordinarily appear, producing unequivocal assurance on that subject. It is from that source that the law has not resulted in securing the acquittal of the accused as frequently as it may have been anticipated it would, at the time when it was enacted.
The object of this prohibition of the constitution was not to prevent the enactment of laws allowing the accused to be sworn in his own behalf, if he chose to avail himself of that privilege, but- it was to prevent the enactment of laws by which the accused might be subjected to actual compulsion to give evidence concerning the subject matter of- the accusation. In many European countries laws of this character existed. 2 Story on Const. 3 ed. Â§ 1788, 4 Sharsw. Blackstone, 325-6. And it was the most unequivocal design to denounce their propriety and render their repetition impossible in this state, that this prohibition was inserted in the Constitution.
Article 5 of the amendments of the Constitution of the United States contains the same prohibition, and still it was not considered as an obstacle in the way of the passage of a similar act by the Congress of the United States.
That act is as broad and subject to the same qualification as the law of 1869 enacted in this state (Sup. to the U. S. Rev. Stat. vol. 1, chap. 37), and like laws have been enacted in very many of the othar states of the Union. But neither of these acts have been declared to be in violation of this constitutional provision by any court, either State or National, and that certainly is very forcible evidence of the conviction that the act is not justly liable to this objection.
Besides that, the defendant voluntarily availed himself of the privilege secured to him by this act, and after having done so, it is diEcult to perceive how the objection can be properly made that any of his lights were violated by availing himself of this privilege. â–?It must therefore, be overruled.
It has also been urged that the question and answer now made one of the subjects of the indictment was an improper one to be propounded to the defendant as a witness. But when he placed himself upon the stand, and gave his 'evidence, it *was within the province of the public prosecutor to show by his cross-examination, if that could be done, that his statements were unworthy of credit. For by making himself a witness, he became subject to the same rules of cross-examination made applicable to other witnesses in legal proceedings. People v. Casey, 72 N. Y. 394.
r And if his answer had been that he was confined as a prisoner in the Eastern Penitentiary, that would have tended very directly to support this position. Brandon v. People, 42 N. Y. 265 ; People v. Crapo, 76 Id. 288.
There is a discrepancy between these cases concerning the propriety of the answer whether the witness had previously been arrested upon a criminal charge. In the first case, it was held to be proper, but in the last that practice was condemned, as probably it should be, inasmuch as no inference of guilt can be drawn from the mere circumstance of a criminal arrest.
Other points have been raised in behalf of the defendant, but they are in substance, more or less, in the nature of repetitions of those which have been considered, and for the disposition of the case, it is not necessary that any special attention shall be bestowed upon them. The case in all these respects was properly disposed of on the trial, and the judgment from which the appeal has been taken should be affirmed.
Brady, J., concurs.
Davis, P. J.
The appellant was indicted for the crime of perjury. The perjury for which the indictment was found was alleged to have been committed on the trial of an indictment in the Court of General Sessions against the appellant for the crime of forgery. The appellant offered himself as a witness in his own behalf, and being duly sworn, gave testimony to the effect that he, the said Edward J. Courtney, had never been arrested upon any charge of manufacturing counterfeit money in his life; that the said Edward J. Courtney was never in any prison, and that he was never in the Eastern Penitentiary, in the city of Philadelphia, in the state of Pennsylvania, and that he had never served a term of imprisonment in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and that he had never gone by any other name than that of Edward J. Courtney.
The indictment averred the contrary of each of these statements to be true, and charged the appellant with having â€?falsely, wickedly, willfully, knowingly, unlawfully and corruptly, committed willful and corrupt perjuryâ€?in giving such testimony. To this indictment the appellant by his counsel filed a demurrer in writing, on the ground that the facts stated in said indictment did not constitute .a crime. Upon the hearing of the demurrer, the court overruled the same and ordered that the defendant plead to the indictment.
The principal point presented by the demurrer is that the statute under which the appellant was permitted upon the trial of the indictment for forgery to offer himself and be sworn as a witness on his own behalf is unconstitutional.
The statute is in these words: â€?In the trial of all indictments, complaints and other proceedings against persons charged with the commission of crimes or offenses, and all proceedings in the nature of criminal proceedings in any and all courts, and before any and all persons acting judicially, the person so charged shall, at his own request, but not otherwise, be deemed a competent witness, but the neglect or refusal of any such person to testify shall not create any presumption against him.â€?Laws 1869, p. 1597.
Section 5 of article 1 of the Constitution of this state provides that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.
The plain signification of this provision is best expressed in its own words. It is designed to prohibit the compulsion of any witness, in any criminal case, to give testimony against himself, and it was aimed of course at all the proceedings of that nature which had ever existed in the past, under the common law or otherwise, by which persons charged with crime could be compelled in any manner to be witnesses against themselves. It was the long established rule of the common law that no person charged with crime could be called as a witness in his own behalf. On the trial of any indictment his mouth was effectually closed, first by the provision of the Constitution, which prevented the people from calling him to testify, and second,, by the rule of the common law which excluded him ' from testifying in his own behalf. The act of 1869 was intended to be a relaxation of the common law rule, by allowing a person charged with crime, at Ms own request, but not otherwise, to â€?be deemed a competent witness.â€?It followed the previous enactments which had enabled parties in all civil actions to be witnesses on the trial of their own suits; and it was intended to enable a person accused of crime to lay before a court and jury such evidence as he might be able to give, in answer to or explanation of the alleged offense and of the evidence tending to establish the same. It sought to prevent his omission to make himself a witness from creating any presumption against him. The idea of compulsion does not enter into the statute at all. The constitutional provision remains in full force unaffected by the statute.
But it is argued that since the statute permits a person ac- â–?cused of crime to make himself a witness in his own behalf, therefore, courts or jurors will be in some degree prejudiced against him, by his neglect to avail himself of the permission. Bnt the statute expressly provides that his neglect or refusal shall not create any presumption against him and, therefore, it cannot be legally assumed that any such presumption can or will arise from the mere existence of the statute. The supposed â€?moral coercionâ€?is not a matter of legal cognizance for the purpose of holding that the statute is void as against the Constitution. Hor indeed, in practice, does it have any such effect. The courts, if desired to do so, are always extremely careful to caution the jury against indulging in any such presumption; and it seems to us a non sequitur to say that there is or can be snch a compulsion as the Constitution prohibits, in the simple fact that the law has conferred upon a party charged with crime, a privilege of which at his own option he may or may not avail himself.
The question of the policy or expediency of the law is not presented for consideration by the demurrer; and of course it is not our province to pass upon that. Any party may waive a constitutional provision in his own behalf at any time, and the waiver, when properly made, puts him precisely in the position as though the constitutional provision in his favor did not exist. It follows, therefore, and is now well settled that where, under â€?the provisions of the statute above cited, a person accusedâ€?of crime elects to become a witness in his own behalf he occupies the same position as any other witness and may be fully examined in conformity to the established rules of evidence, to contradict any testimony he may give, or to impeach or impair his own credibility, in the same manner as that of' any other witness may be impaired.
We are referred to the cases of People v. Ruloff, 45 N. Y. 213, and Connors v. People, 50 Id. 240, for the expression of views in decided hostility to the policy or constitutionality of the law of 1869. But the question of its constitutionality was not before the court, and there is nothing in the opinions to lead us to the conclusion that the statute is unconstitutional. Those opinions were delivered at a time when the act of 1869 was in general disfavor with lawyers aceustomed to the former rule, and before its policy had been vindicated or tested by experience. It may be said to be doubtful whether the same views would be expressed after the experience of the effect of the statute for the last ten years.
The other point made under the demurrer is that the testimony set forth in the indictment and alleged to have been false was not material to the issue of the trial. The rule undoubtedly is, that the assignment of perjury must be a matter pertinent and material to the issue or case in question: But it is well settled that the credibility of a witness who gives testimony affecting an issue is always material; and hence legal testimony which affects such credibility is always within the issue on trial.
Archbold lays down the rule thus: â€?Every question in cross-examination which goes to the credibility of a witness is material for this purpose.â€?Archibald Crim. Pr. 817. This rule was declared by the twelve judges in Reg. v. Gibbon, 9 Cox C. C. 105."" In Reg. v. Lavey, 3 Carr. & K. the accused had falsely sworn that she had never been tried in the Central Criminal Court and' had never been in- custody at the Thames Police Station. On her trial for perjury these statements were held to be material, and her conviction was sustained. In the Commonwealth v. Bonner, 97 Mass. 587, the witness was asked if he had been in the House of Correction for any crime. This question was objected to as. immaterial, but it was held to be material. See also Wood v. People, 59 N. Y. 17; Reg. v. Worley, 3 Cox C. C. 535; Reg. v. Gibbons, supra; Reg. v. Overton, 2 Moody Crown Cases Res. 263.
In the case of the United States v. Elmersberg before Benedict, J., this precise question was presented and fully examined, and in' the manuscript opinion in that case, now before us, the court reached the same conclusion we have expressed.
We are, therefore, of opinion that the demurrer was properly overruled.
On the trial the record of the conviction in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania of a person by the name of Christopher Richards upon his plea of guilty of the offense charged in the indictment and his sentence thereupon to be imprisoned in â€?the Eastern Penitentiary in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the term of three years was put in evidence, and a witness, who was an overseer at the Eastern Penitentiary, was called and testified that the prisoner at the bar was imprisoned in that penitentiary on a sentence of three years and served his time, by the name of Christopher Richards.
â–?Another witness was also called, who testified substantially to the same effect, and both witnesses identified the present appellant as the person who was imprisoned by the name of Christopher Richards. It appeared on cross-examination of one of the witnesses that the official designation of the penitentiary which they called â€œthe Eastern Penitentiary,â€?is â€œthe Eastern State Penitentiary of Pennsylvania.â€?The assignment of perjury in the indictment is that the appellant testified â€?that he, the said Edward J. Courtney, had never been arrested upon any charge of manufacturing counterfeit money in his life; that he, the said Edward J. Courtney, was never in any prison, and that he was never in the Eastern Penitentiary in the city of Philadelphia, in the state of Pennsylvania, and that he had never served a term of imprisonment in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and that he had never gone by any other name than that of Edward J. Courtney.â€?It is now insisted that there is a fatal variance in the testimony, inasmuch as it was not shown that the Eastern Penitentiary and the Eastern State Penitentiary were one and the same institution, and that the evidence that the defendant was in the Eastern State Penitentiary was not evidence to show that he was in the Eastern Penitentiary.
We do not think there is any force in this objection. The appellant testified that he was never in any prison, and that he was never in the Eastern Penitentiary in the city of Philadelphia. The evidence showed that he was in a penitentiary; that he had been imprisoned; that he was in the Eastern Penitentiary in the city of Philadelphia and state of Pennsylvania, the legal title of which is the Eastern State Penitentiary.
It is evident that the common title of the prison was the Eastern' Penitentiary, and that the legal title of the prison known by that name is the Eastern State Penitentiary. If this be a variance, it is not, we think, a fatal or serious one, because it is obvious that the prisoner was not in any degree prejudiced by the omission of the word â€?State,â€?either in his testimony, on the former trial, or in the charging part of the indictment.
These are all the points- suggested to us on the argument which we deem of sufficient importance to comment upon any f
further than to say that none of those not noticed by us are of any practical value.
The result is that the judgment and conviction should be .affirmed.

U. S. Circuit Court, Second Circuit, (Southern District of New York), June, 1883. United States v. Elmersberg.
Benedict, J.â€”The accused having been convicted of perjury, now moves for a new trial and in arrest of judgment. The principal question presented for determination is whether the crime of perjury was committed by the accused when he made the false statement under oath, as set forth in the indictment. This statement was made under the following circumstances, as shown at-the trial. The accused had been-arrested by virtue of a commissionerâ€™s warrant upbn a charge of having uttered counterfeit coin. He demanded an examination, and upon such examination, duly held before the commissioner, he offered himself as a witness in his own behalf and was duly sworn as such. Upon his cross-examination, in answer to a question put without objection, he testified that he had not been in prison in this state or in any other state, when the ' fact was that he had been imprisoned in the State prison of this state and also in the State prison of New Jersey.
Thereafter the present indictment was found against Â«him, in. which the perjury.assigned is testifying, under the circumstances. above stated, that he never was in prison in this state or in any other state..
On the part of the accused the point made is that the false matter so stated by the accused before the commissioner was not material matter within the meaning of the statute, and therefore, the crime, created by-the statute was not committed.
The essential element of the oSense created by the statute (R. S. Â§ 5392) is the materiality of the matter charged to have been falsely stated. The words employed in that statute are â€œmaterial matter.â€?These words were doubtless adopted from the common law, and they must be given a significance broad enough at least to. cover cases of perjury at common law. The rule of the, common law: in regard to perjury is thus stated by Archibald : Eyery.question in cross-examination which goes to the witnessâ€™s credit is material for this purpose. Arch. Grim. Pr. & PI. 817,. The same rule was declared by the twelve judges in Reg. Â«. Gibbons, -9 Cox O. G. 108.
The inquiry here, therefore, is whether the imprisonment of the accused in this state and in New Jersey was calculated to injure his character, and so to impeach his credit as a witness, for it is not to be doubted that when the accused offered himself as a witness he placed himself upon the same footing as any other witness, and was liable to be examined in the same manner. Upon this question it is our opinion that the matter stated by the accused as a witness had an obvious bearing upon the character of the witness, and could properly be considered by the commissioner as determining what credit would be given to the testimony of the witness in respect to the crime with which he stood charged. In Reg. e. Lavey, 3 O. & K. 29, the accused, when a witness had falsely sworn that she had never been tried in the Central Criminal Court and had never been in custody at the Thames Police Station. On her trial for perjury these statements were ruled to be material matter and conviction was sustained. In Commonwealth Â». Bonner, 97 Mass. 587, a witness had been asked â€?if be had been in the House of Correction for any crime ? â€?Objection to the question on the ground that the record was the best evidence was waived, and the case turned upon the materiality of the question. The matter was held to be material. The present case is stronger, for here no objection whatever was interposed to the inquiry respecting the imprisonment of the accused. Having made no objection to the inquiry and gained all the advantage to be secured by his false statement, it may perhaps be that it does not lie in his mquth now to say that his statement was not material. See Rex v. Gibbons, supra ; Rex v. Mullany, L. & O. 593. But however this may be, it is our opinion that the statement he made was material matter within the meaning of the statute, because calculated to affect his credit as a witness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1164440,PEOPLE v. COURTNEY,1884-01,"Andrews, J.
The argument in support of the demurrer to the indictment rests upon three propositions; first, that by section 6, article 1, of the Constitution, no person can be compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against himself.; second, that the act, chapter 678 of the Laws of 1869, violates this constitutional provision ; and third, that false swearing on the trial of an indictment by the party indicted on his examination, under the act of 1869 is not therefore legal perjury. Whether the conclusion is a logical or legal deduction from the premises need not be considered, for the reason, that the minor premise is not well founded. The act of 1869 is permissive and not compulsory. It permits a person, charged with crime, to be a witness in his own behalf. But it does not compel him to testify, nor does it permit the prosecution to call him as a witness. He can be sworn only at his election, and the statute declares that his omission, or refusal to testify shall create no presumption against him. The policy of the act of 1869 has been criticised in some cases in this court. But the policy or propriety of a law is a legislative and. not a judicial question. The supposed moral coercion upon a person, accused of crime, to offer himself as a witness, byreason of the adverse inference which might be drawn from his omission to testify when presumably all the facts are known to him, is not compulsion ^within the meaning of the Constitution.
The Constitution primarily refers to compulsion exercised through the process of the courts, or through laws acting' directly upon the party, and has no reference to an indirect and argumentative pressure, such as is claimed is exerted by the statute of 1869. A law which while permitting a person accused of crime to be a witness in his own behalf, should at the same time authorize a presumption of guilt from his omission to testify, would be a law adjudging guilt without evidence, and while it might not be obnoxious to the constitutional provision against compelling a party in a criminal case to be a witness against himself, would be a law reversing the presumption of innocence and would violate fundamental principles binding alike upon the legislature and the courts. The act of 1869 expressly precludes such a presumption from the silence of the accused, and while it may be difficult for a jury in many cases to exclude the inference of guilt from an omission of a defendant to be sworn, we cannot assume that it may not be done. The statute assumes it to be possible, and we cannot say judicially that such assumption is unfounded. The demurrer was therefore properly overruled.
The only remaining question, worthy of notice, arises upon the motion of the prisonerâ€™s counsel on the trial, that the court should direct an acquittal on the ground that the matters, on which the perjury was assigned, were immaterial. It is true that the false testimony did not bear directly upon the main issue on the trial for forgery, but only upon the credit of the witness, who gave material evidence on the merits on that trial. Evidence going to the credit of a witness who has given material evidence is relevant, because it helps the jury in determining the main issue. The recent cases sustain the view, that perjury may be assigned upon false testimony going to the credit of a witness. Reg. v. Gibbons, 9 Cox C. C. 501; Rex v. Larey, v. Carr. & K. 26; Arch. Crim. Pr. 817.
False swearing in respect to such matter is not distinguishable, in respect to moral turpitude, from false swearing upon the merits, and we think there is no just reason for refusing to treat false swearing as perjury whenever the testimony is relevant to the ease, although it may not directly bear upon the issue to be found. The questions are carefully considered in the opinions at General Term and further elaboration is unnecessary.
Judgment affirmed.
All concur.
Note.â€”In an article, entitled â€?The Validity of Statutes Authorizing the Accused to testify,â€?14 Amer. Law Rev. 753, it is argued that those statutes are in conflict with the constitutional prohibition against compelling the accused to testify against himself. But while the cases cited (State v. Lawrence, 57 Maine 581; State v. Cleaves, 59 Id. 398; 8 Amer. Rep. 433; State v. Bartlett, 55 Me. 316) criticise the policy and wisdom of these statutes, they do not pass on their constitutionality. It is believed that the case at bar is the first one in which the question of the constitutionality of these laws is squarely met and dealt with.
A recent and valuable article â€œThe Accused as a Witness,â€?4 Crim. Law Mag. 323, contains the statutes on this subject of the fourteen States which have authorized the accused to testify.
In the most recent case (taken from advance sheets) in the Supreme Court of Ohio, the rule as to the materiality of evidence is well stated: â€œA witness may be guilty of perjury, not only by swearing corruptly and falsely to the fact which is immediately in issue, but also to any material circumstance which legitimately tends to prove or disprove such fact; or to any circumstance which has the effect to strengthen and corroborate the testimony upon the main fact, or which affects the credit of the witness giving such testimony .... 3 Russell on Crimes, 12; Bishop Crim. Law, Â§Â§ 1034, 1037; Reg. v. Tyson, Law Rep. 1. C. C. 107; Reg. v. Overton, C. & M. 655; 45 E. C. L. 83; Commonwealth v. Grant, 116 Mass. 17; Commonwealth v. Sargent, 129 Mass. 115; Wharton Crim. Law, Â§Â§ 2229, 2230; Cr. Pr. & Pl. Â§ 158 . . . It is not necessary that the testimony upon which perjury can be predicated, must have the effect, if true, of establishing or deciding the matter in issue. It is sufficient if it has a legitimate bearing on that issue. If it tends within the rules of law to influence the court or jury in deciding that issue, it is material.â€?Dilcher v.

1167674,MATTER OF PAUL,1884-01,"Finch, J.
The relator was arrested upon a warrant issued by a police justice of the city of Hew York, which recited an accusation upon sworn information that, â€œDavid A. Paul committed the crime of manufacturing cigars and preparing tobacco in the house No. 375 East Eighth street, the same being a tenement house, occupied by more than three families living independent of one another therein, in rooms in said tenement house which at the time were occupied by said David A. Paul and his family as a dwelling for the purpose of living, sleeping and the doing of household work; said rooms or apartments being on the east or right hand section of the fourth floor in said tenement house, adjoining each other in a contiguous line from the windows opening into the street, to the windows opening into the yard of said tenement house.â€?The precise offense charged, is somewhat obscured by the words describing the character of the house and the location of the rooms, but is nevertheless a specific accusation of manufacturing cigars in a room or rooms, which room or rooms were, at the same time, used as living or household rooms. In other words, the charge asserts the co-existence at the same time and in the same room or rooms of cigar manufacturing and household use.
Precisely this offense is described in the first section of the act under which the prosecution was instituted (laws 1883, ch. 93). That section reads: â€?The manufacture of cigars or preparation of tobacco in any form in any rooms or apartments which in the city of Hew York are used as dwellings for the. purpose of living, sleeping or doing any household work therein is hereby prohibited.â€?The scope of this section seems quite clear. It is not so broad as it appeared to us on the argument. It does not forbid the manufacture of cigars in a dwelling-house. It forbids it only in such rooms or apartments within the house as are at the same time used for the purposes of â€?living, sleeping or doing any household work-therein.â€?So that, under this section, in any dwelling house, the same room or apartment, must not, at the same time, be used for cigar-making and for family purposes. But the owner or occupant of a house may manufacture cigars in one or more rooms therein, provided that he uses them for no household purposes and separates entirely the domestic from the business uses. The prohibition is aimed entirely at the co-existence of the cigar-making, and the sleeping or living of the family in the same room or apartment. If they are kept separate, and in separate or distinct apartments it is no offense under this first section that the business use and the domestic use go on under the same roof or in the same house.
That the relator did not preserve such separation is the gist of the charge in the warrant. It accuses him of manufacturing cigars in rooms which, â€?at the time,â€?â€?were occupiedâ€?by him and his family 11 for the purpose of living, sleeping and the doing of household work.â€?Just this offense was charged in the information. The deposition of the complainant averred that Paul manufactured cigars â€œin rooms or apartmentsâ€?which â€?were then and there used by the, said David A. Paul as a dwelling for the purpose of living and sleeping and doing household work therein.â€?So that the complaint and the warrant alike charged the offense described in section 1.
But upon the hearing before the magistrate the complainant was examined as required by law (Code Crim. Proc. Â§ 194). The witness was cross-examined in behalf of the defendant (Â§ 195). The examination was signed by the witness and certified by the magistrate, and is before us, returned as part of the record. It tended to show that an offense had been committed under section 1, and that there was propable cause for believing the relator guilty of violating that section. After describing the location of the rooms as consisting of four, extending through from front to rear, the two middle rooms occupied as bed-rooms and the rear room as a kitchen, which left the front room capable of use as a sitting or living room, he said: â€?there are residers in front facing the street and r.esiders in the rear facing the yard.â€?Other statements tended in the same direction, and, while the evidence was weak and lacked precision, there was enough to call into play the discretion and judgment of the rpagistrate. lie held the prisoner for trial. Presumably the commitment was â–?upon the charge made by the complainant, stated in the warrant, and investigated upon the hearing. But two facts make it possible that such presumption is ill founded. The magistrate apparently had authority to issue process of commitment for a crime developed on the examination although not charged in the original warrant (Code Crim. Proc. Â§ 208), and the evidence tended to prove a violation of section 2 of the act. The magistrate might have held the prisoner, therefore, for a violation of either section or of both. But if not satisfied by the evidence that section 2 had been probably violated and yet of opinion that section 1 had been, he was at liberty to commit the prisoner for a violation of section 1 only,, which was precisely the crime charged in the complaint and warrant of arrest. That is exactly what the- magistrate did. To be quite sure of it requires an analysis of section 2.
That section provides that â€?no part of any section of any floor in any tenement house in the city of New York, in which the manufacture of cigars or the preparation of tobacco is carried on, shall be used for dwelling purposes."" There is no mistaking what is not, and what is the misdemeanor here prohibited. It is not the manufacture of cigars in the tenement house or the room therein devoted to that purpose. That is not prohibited. On the contrary, the section treats it as a lawful and proper trade, lawfully carried on in the locality adopted. The prohibition and the crime consist in one of two things, viz: either in beginning an occupation for family use of the three rooms in the present case, when the front room was already occupied for cigar-making; or in continuing the family use of the three rooms after the front room had become a cigar manufactory. The person guilty of this somewhat novel crime might or might not be the cigar-maker himself. If Paul had rented the front room and began his manufacture, and then a third person had moved his family into the three rooms, that third person would have been the criminal and not Paul. He could not have been lawfully arrested, nor his honest pursuit of a lawful trade interfered with. If Paul, himself, moved his family into the three rooms he could have been arrested, but for that offense and that only. His crime would not have been the manufacture of cigars in the house, for no law forbade ; nor in the room selected, for that, too, was lawful; but would have been the entirely distinct and separate act of moving his family into the three rooms, notwithstanding his lawful manufacture in the front room. It becomes thus apparent, that under the act of 1883, the manufacture of cigars never violates its terms and never becomes a crime, save in the single instance named in the first section, where it is carried on in a room or rooms used at the same time for family purposes.
Turning now to the commitment to see for what offense the prisoner was held for trial, we find it to be â€?willfully violating chapter 93 of the Laws of 1883 of the State of New York in manufacturing cigars at and within a tenement house at 375 East Eighth street, in said city.â€?The warrant of commitment is required to state briefly the nature of the crime. Code Crim. Proc. Â§ 214. This warrant does so. Making every allowance for brevity, it does not state any offense under the second section, since the manufacture of cigars is in no case under that section a crime ; but it does state one, and the only one which can possibly answer that description, under the first section. As it was of such offense that the prisoner was accused, and for such offense that he was arrested, and the commitment describes that and no other, we cannot say that he was arrested for one crime, and committed for another. If that were true, the warrant of commitment should, at least, have briefly stated what that new and distinct offense was ; the nature of the crime. It thus appears that the relator is held for a violation of section 1, and that alone. Why the magistrate did not determine that section 2 had been violated we may not inquire. Even if both the complaint and warrant of arrest may be read as charging such a violation, which is difficult, but perhaps not wholly impossible, there is no ambiguity in the warrant of commitment. It holds the prisoner for .a criminal manufacture of cigars, and no such. offense exists under section 2.
It is then claimed on the part of the appellant, that; at least, section 1 is unconstitutional because of a defect in the title of the act, within the provisions of section 16, article 3, of the constitution of the state. . The title of the act is, â€?An Act to improve, the public health by prohibiting the manufacture of cigars, or the preparation of tobacco in any form., in the tenement ho usesof said city.â€?It is not denied that the act is â€?local,â€?since its operation is limited to the city of New York; and being such, it is said that it relates to two distinct subjects, only one off which is mentioned in the title. We think the objection is well founded. The subject referred to in the title is the manufacture of. cigars in tenement houses. These houses, as a known and a distinct class, are recognized and defined by law. Laws 1873, ch. 335; Sanitary Cod N. Y. Â§ 3. They are apt to be ill-ventilated, unclean, and packed full of inmates, and to become centers or radiating points of contagious disease. As such they might become the proper subjects of sanitary regulation in the interest of the public health. To such regulation in one specific respect the title of the bill fairly relates, but no one would suspect from such tille that the bill also undertook to regulate the occupation of every dwelling-house in the city. Two new crimes are created by the act. One of them has relation to the tenement houses alone; the other to the dwellings of the whole city. One of them is committed by a mode of occupying rooms in a tenement house, the other by manufacturing cigars in any family rooms. The two offenses are unlike, different, and entirely distinct and separate. The latter is not at all stated in the title, because that is narrowed so that it does not embrace it. Practically, the narrow and specific title confined entirely to tenement houses, a class of buildings known to and defined by the law, operated as a fraud and deception upon the people of the city. In Harris v. People, 59 N. Y. 600, citing also People ex rel. Lee v. Supervisors of Chautauqua, 43 N. Y. 10, it was declared to be one definite purpose of the constitutional provision to advise the public and the locality, and the representatives of the locality, and of other parts, of the general purpose of the bill, so that those interested might be on their guard as to the whole, or as to the details of the bill. The citizens of Hew York, jealous of interference with their homes, reading the title of this bill, would be deceived, misled, and thrown off their guard. Assuming that the measure proposed related to the sanitary condition of crowded tenement houses, each citizen wouldâ€?take no heed, and find in the end that his own dwelling house' had been regulated. The legislator who should judge of the bill by its title might deem it proper or harmless, and find too late that the period of objection or resistance was gone. If the law had borne a true and not a false label, warning would have been given. ""Where the title is such that it gives no hint of the real subject of the enactment; where it furnishes no particle of truthful information, and he who reads it is not bound to know or suspect that the actual enactment does or may exist; and where, as a consequence, the title is misleading and deceptive, it is safe and right to apply the constitutional prohibition. Most of the cases in which the question has arisen have been the precise reverse of the one before us. They have been those in which the title was so broad and general that a multitude of various details could be fairly deemed embraced within it. Of this character have been titles to legalize certain proceedings in relation to certain contracts or local improvements, and to organize or amend the charters of municipal corporations. Tifft v. City of Buffalo, 82 N. Y. 211; Re Volkening, 52 Id. 650; Village of Gloversville v. Howell, 70 Id. 290 ; Re Mayer, 50 Id. 505 ; People ex rel. City of Rochester v. Briggs, Id. 553; Matter of L. & W. Orphan Home, 92 Id. 120; Harris v. People, 59 Id. 600. The title here is not broad, but narrow; not general, but specific ; not reasonable and fair, but deceptive and misleading. Hobody would infer, and nobody was bound to imagine that under a title relating to tenement houses alone, there' was enacted in its first section a law affecting not tenement houses as such, but all the dwelling houses in the city; a law as to which the title not only did not relate, but by its narrow terms affirmatively and positively excluded it. Hor is section 1 of the act before us, saved by the doctrine which we have several times applied, that if a local act con. tains a subject which is properly expressed in the title, it is valid as to that subject, although invalid as to a subject not expressed for the doctrine applies only where there are two or more subjects, some expressed and some not expressed, while in section 1 there is but one subject, and that not expressed in the title at all. Re Sackett Street, 74 N. Y. 103 ; Re Van Antwerp, 56 Id. 261; People ex rel. City of Rochester v. Briggs, 50 Id. 353. Hor will it do to avoid the difficulty by saying that as the phrase, dwelling, includes within it tenement house, we may hold the section good as to a part of its meaning, and repudiate it as to the balance, for that, in this case, would be an act of legislation. It would require us to amend the section by striking out the general word dwelling, and substituting the phrase tenement house, and then to hold the section good as amended by the court. The constitutional provision deals with the law itself as it came from the legislature. We capnot change and narrow its terms to save it. In the room of the subject, plainly stated, we cannot put one narrower and different in order to get it within the title. The section must stand or fall just as it was enacted, and without reference to extrinsic facts developed in cases under it.' But all the reasons for holding it not within the title, culminate in this, that the title not only failed to express the subject of the section, but by its frame and phrase expressly and affirmatively excluded that subject; for when it professed to relate to tenement house, it substantially declared that it did not relate to dwelling houses generally, which was precisely the one subject to which it did relate. Where the title thus deceives and misleads, the constitutional provision should apply if it is over to be enforced.
For this reason we hold section 1 to be unconstitutional, and that being so, it follows that the relator is held for an alleged crime which did not exist and which he could not commit, and that he should be discharged.
It is not necessary to consider further the effect of this conclusion upon the remaining sections of the act nor the very grave and serious argument upon the question whether the act as a whole is within the police power of the state, and capable of being sustained under the constitution. Those questions should be reserved for an occasion, if it shall arise, when their determination is essential and necessary to the conclusion to be reached.
The order appealed from should be reversed and the relator discharged.

1167675,PEOPLE v. BELLOWS,1884-02,"Brady, J.
The defendant moved at the Court of Oyer and Terminer that he be furnished with a bill of particulars in relation to the several indictments found against him, and for a copy of the minutes of the grand jury or permission to inspect the same through his counsel. The application rests iipon the affidavit of the latter stating that it would be unsafe for him to proceed to trial, and that he could not make the necessary preparation for a complete defense, unless furnished with such bill of particulars and a copy of the minutes of the grand jury.
I have not the time to'give more than a general statement of the reasons which lead to the conclusions which I am about to state, and therefore give little more than the. result only of my examination of the application.
In the case of Eighmy v. People, 79 N. Y. 546-560, it was declared that the refusal of the court to compel the public prosecutor to furnish the prisonerâ€™s counsel with the evidence before the grand jury was a matter resting in the discretion of the court, and was not the subject of review upon writ of error. The necessity for a copy of the minutes in this case is not, I think, sufficiently shown by the affidavit of counsel. I entertain the opinion, however, that in some respects the particulars which he seeks to obtain for the benefit of his client should be given, if the indictments in the form in which they now exist are to be pressed on all the counts contained in them of embezzlement and grand larceny.
The statement of the embezzlement is sufficiently definite to advise the defendant of the charge made against him, and therefore as to them he is not entitled to any further particulars. In relation, however, to the counts for grand larceny it must be said that they are so general, and embrace so many subjects of larceny, that they do not advise the defendant with sufficient distinctness of the charge in each made against him. Each of them is,, in my judgment, altogether too indefinite in its character. The defendant should be advised of the accusation against him, with sufficient certainty to enable him to prepare for his defense. There is"" no good reason why such a requirement should not be enforced. Each person accused of crime should be given the benefit of every reasonable opportunity to prepare for his defense, and to prove his innocence. The law is not seeking victims, but criminals, and every man until he is proved to be guilty is presumed, to be innocent. If for example a person is charged with appropriating a check belonging to another, and its proceeds, and desires it, a copy of the check should be given to him. If he is charged with stealing a sum of money, inasmuch as the public prosecutor knows what sum he is accused of having stolen, unless it is stated in such a way in the indictment as to advise him clearly of it, he should, on application, be fully informed so as to enable him to prepare for his defense.
- The Code of Criminal Procedure by the sections relating to the form of an indictment (Â§Â§ 275, 276) declares that there shall be a plain and concise statement of the'act, constituting the crime, without unnecessary repetition. And this is in conformity to a very plain and just proposition, which is, when a man is charged with the commission of an offense, he should be so advised of it that he may understand it, and what preparation is necessary to make and establish his innocence, if lie can do it, and this rule applies more particularly to a case like this in which the defendant was not taken before a magistrate in the first instance where he would be entitled to a hearing, and therefore to a perfect exposition of the charge made against him.
For these reasons, briefly stated, I think, in reference to the charges of embezzlement, no further particulars are necessary, although in regard to the check alluded to in one of them, a copy should be furnished, if desired by the defendant; and as to the charges of grand larceny the sums stolen, upon proof of which the people rely, should be particularly stated, so that the defendant may be advised of the precise charges under the counts relating to the crime and thus be enabled to prepare tc meet them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1167682,PEOPLE v. KELLY,1884-01,"Daniels, J.
The exceptions taken in the case do not appear to present any point which can materially benefit the defendant. The inquiry made of the witness Strack, and answered by him, sufficiently showed his friendly relations with the prosecuting witness, and no more would have been proved by him if he had been permitted to answer the question when he handed him the three hundred dollars he collected and gave him ; the important inquiries which could by their answers in any manner affect Ms credit, had all been previously responded to. Neither was it important in any view of the case to prove that Strack had previously had difficulties with other persons, or that his general reputation as a man of violence, should be introduced into the case. Neither of these inquiries had any possible connection with the issue which was being tried, and the evidence was not offered to impeach his credit. The other objections and exceptions are still more clearly without any legal foundation, and need not therefore be considered. After the close of the trial, a motion was made in arrest of judgment, but as it was in neither of the causes mentioned in section 467 or 331 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it could not regularly be entertained as such. It was not made upon anything appearing by the indictment or in the record of the proceedings in the case, and it was not therefore a motion in arrest of judgment, as that has been declared and defined, but it was in fact, as well as in form, a motion for anew trial made upon affidavits, but as such it was not within either of the subdivisions of section 465 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for it was not' made for either of the causes for which, within that section, a motion for a new trial can regularly be entertained. The motion was made upon the ground that after the jury had retired to deliberate upon their verdict, and while they were under the charge of the officer for that purpose, a note or communication was sent from one of the jurors to the recorder who presided at the trial; that it was taken by him, and some writing or note was made by him and sent back to the jury ; what this wasâ€”whether it related to the case, to the trial, the convenience or physical wants of the juryâ€”was not made to appear ; in fact there was no intimation or evidence whatever from which it could be inferred that it related in any manner to the case which the jury at the time were considering. But if a statement of the fact itself had been inserted in the case, an opportunity would have then been offered to the recorder to make an explanation disclosing the nature and extent of the communication ; that was the course which regularly should have been pursued, for, as was held in Maurer v. People, 43 N. Y. 1, it was a part of the trial if the communication related to the case, and that course should have been taken regularly to present the point, instead of a motion for a new trial upon affidavits under section 465 of the Oode Criminal Procedure, for neither of the subdivisions under that section have provided for such an application. But assuming the application in this form to have been regular, it did not entitle the defendant to another trial of the issue; for that purpose it should have been made to appear with some degree of probability at least, that the note or communication sent to the jury had some relation to the case they were considering. It is riot to be presumed, in the absence of proof, that such was its character, for to indulge in that presumption, without evidence, would be to presume that the recorder violated his duties as a judge, and that presumption is not, without proof, to be entertained. The presumption of the law, on the contrary, is, that no official person acting under oath of office will do aught which is against his official duty to do, or will omit to do aught which his official duty requires should be done. Mandeville v. Reynolds, 68 N. Y. 528-534.
And that the communication did not relate to the case, may be assumed from the denial by the recorder of the motion upon the affidavits for a new trial. For if it had, it was his duty under the authorities then probably brought to his attention, to set aside the verdict, which he would undoubtedly have done if the communication had any relation whatever to the case. To set aside the verdict without such proof would also violate another equally settled rule of law, and that is, that error must not bepresumed, but must be shown ; and in all the cases, with one exception, where a like point has been considered, it was made to appear as a matter of fact that some communication was made by the justice or judge presiding at the trial, to the jury, in the absence of the party concerning the case. Maurer v. People, supra; Taylor v. Betsford, 13 Johns. 487; Plunkett v. Appleton, 51 How. 469.
It is true that very broad language was used upon this subject in Sargent v. Roberts, 1 Pick. 337, but it must be ;understood and construed as addressed to the case which ,was then before the court, and that was a case in which an important communication relating to the issue which the jury had in charge was made to them after they had retired, and in the absence of the parties. Hoberg v. State, 3 Minn. 262, is the only exception to this rule which has been found relating to this subject. In that case it appears that the judge visited the. jury in their room, and that .was held to be improper, although it was made to appear that he was there simply to inform them that they must come into court if they required any further information. This is an extreme case, carrying a legal technicality to a point where it could be of no substantial benefit either to the accused or the public; for it was entirely evident that no possible injury could result to him, from what was shown to have taken place. This case has not been followed by any other authority, and the legal propriety of the decision has been doubted by a distinguished and reliable author upon criminal law (1 Bishop, 2 ed. Â§ 1000), where it was stated that all the courts would not hold such an irregularity, where nothing wrong was meant, or shown, to be a ground for a new trial, even though the individual making the communication was an indifferent person. And that it should not be a ground for a new trial is further si^pported by the general law that official misbehavior, or the irregularities of jurors themselves, will not allow the verdict to be set aside where no injury has been produced by it to the parties complaining. Com. v. Roby, 12 Pick. 496-519 ; Whelchell v. State, 23 Ind. 89; Harrison v. Price, 22 Id. 165.
And this wholesome general principle has been made applicable to motions for new trials in criminal cases. For, by the language of section 465 of the. Code of Criminal Procedure, the verdict is only to be set aside on a motion for that purpose, where the substantial rights of the accused have been prejudiced by it; and by section 542 of the same Code,-it has been extended to the disposition of appeals, which are required to be determined without regard to technical errors or defects, or to exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties. And 'as it is not to be presumed that the recorder was guilty of misconduct in sending the communication which he did to the jury, as he would have been if it related to the case, which it Was not shown to have done, these provisions are directly applicable to the disposition of this appeal. The inquiry of the jury may have been concerning the temperature of their room, the probability of its continuance, their desire for refreshments, or the length of time to which the sessions of the court would be extended, or some other subject connected with their own convenience ; for such inquiries are frequently made by jurors to the court, and as they do not relate to the case itself, are considered proper subjects of an informal answer. And they may be answered in that manner without in the least degree prejudicing any right or interest of the accused. If this was not a communication of this description, the fact itself should in some manner have been shown, and it could have been done by a direct inquiry of the recorder himself, or by including a statement of it in the case, when an explanation of the subject would have been pertinent and proper. Ho injustice is done to the accused by requiring certainly as much as that from him, before an application of this character should be allowed to prove successful. The public interest in the administration of. justice should not be defeated, as they would be by so extreme and technical construction of this act, as would be given to it if the inference should be drawn that the recorder had, as a fact, misconducted himself on this occasion. The facts themselves logically warrant no such conclusion, and the rule established by all well-considered authorities precludes its adoption.
The judgment, therefore, should be affirmed.

1167692,PEOPLE v. BECKWITH,1884-01,"Rufus B. Cowing, City Judge.
The grand jury of this county, in the year 1876, found and presented to this court, fourteen different indictment against the defendant. In some, the defendant was charged with embezzlement and in the others with forgery.
Some time in the latter part of the year 1876, the defendant was tried and found guilty, upon two of the said indictments ; and was sentenced by the court, to state prison, for the term of five years on each, making ten years in all.
The defendant having served out his term of imprisonment, less commutation for good conduct, now moves the court, under section 671 of the Court of Criminal Procedure, for the dismissal of the remaining twelve untried indictments.
The district attorney opposes the motion, upon the ground, among others, that the court has no power to grant it.
After a careful examination, I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the district attorney is right.
I have come to the conclusion, that this motion must be determined by the practice and procedure, as it existed before the first day of September, 1881, when the Code of Criminal Procedure went into effect; and that neither section 671 nor 668 of the said Code, can be invoked to aid in deciding it.
All the alleged offenses, set forth in the said indictments, were committed, and all the indictments were found and presented, and became records of this court, long before the said Code containing sections 668 and 671, went into effect. Both of said sections are new, and were not law previous to the Code.
Section 962 of the said code expressly provides, that all actions and proceedings, commenced before the first of September, 1881, â€?must be conducted in the same manner as if this Code had not been passed. â€?In my judgment, a criminal action is commenced, so far as this court is concerned, when the indictment is filed, and becomes a record of this court: and it follows, that all indictments filed in this- court, previous to September 1, 1881 (which is the case with all the indictments in question), must be tried in the same manner, as if there were no law in existence like that mentioned in said sections 668 and 671: or, in â€?other words, we must be guided by the practice and procedure, as it existed previous to the Code, in the final disposition of the remaining indictments. I have failed to find any rule of law or practice, existing before the Code, giving me the power, upon a motion like this, to dismiss an indictment.
The Revised Statutes provided that the court might discharge & prisoner, who should not be brought to trial, before the end of the next term of the court held after filing the indictment. It will be observed, that this does not give the court power, as does section 668 of the Code, to dismiss the indictment; but only to discharge -the prisoner from imprisonment.
The old practice of entering a nolle prosequi is abolished by section 672 of the Code; and under the old practice, that was a proceeding which had to be initiated by the district attorney. The court never had the power, of its own motion to direct the entry of a nolle prosequi. It required the joint action of the district attorney and the court; and one could not act in that respect, without the other.
As I said before, I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that I have no power to grant the defendantâ€™s motion, for the reason that all the circumstances, and the usual practice followed in this court, indicate pretty clearly to my mind, that there was? at least, a tacit understanding, that the trial, conviction and Sentence of the defendant, upon the two indictments, would answer the ends of justice. Subsequent events have rather confirmed me in this belief; so that, it now seems to me, to savor rather more of persecution than prosecution.
The motion is denied for want of power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1167670,PEOPLE v. WOODWARD,1883-09,"Boardman, J.
The court below did not properly state the legal questions before the jury. Upon the evidence it is certainly a grave question whether the act charged and proved was larceny or malicious mischief. To constitute larceny, there must have been a felonious intent, animo furandi or lucri causa. The malicious killing of a horse is a misdemeanor. Penal Code, Â§ 654; 2 R. S. *695; L. 1866, c. 682. The offenses are quite distinct. In either case there is a trespass. In larceny the taking must be for the purpose of converting to the use of the taker; in malicious mischief no such intent is necessary. In the present case the evidence tends to show a taking of the horse to kill him, with a sole desire to injure the owner. It was incumbent on the court then, to point out to the jury the legal elements in the crime of larceny, so as to distinguish it from malicious mischief. This, we think, was not done. The jury was told, in substance, if defendant took, or procured to be taken, this horse, and killed, or aided in killing him, he must be found guilty. In no part of the charge is this language modified or qualified.
The seventh request to charge is as follows: â€?There must have been a felonious intent, for without such, an intent there was no crime; and the felonious intent must have been formed before the taking ; and that if, before the taking of the horse, the intent was to take it and kill it, the crime would not be a felony, but an offense under the statute, classed among misdemeanors, under the term malicious mischief.â€?The defendant excepted to the refusal to charge as requested. The request to charge, the refusal to charge, and the exception, are all very informal and inartificial, but sufficient, we think, to present the important point in the case. The defendant was entitled to have the jury instructed in substance as requested. Mr. Wharton, in his work on Criminal Law (Â§Â§ 1781-4), has considered whether larceny can exist where there is no intent on the part of the taker to reap any advantage from the taking. He has reviewed the decisions, from the case of Rex v. Cabbage, Russ. & Ry. C. C. 292, cited by the district attorney, to the time of his writing, and concludes that the qualification â€?luori causa â€?has been accepted by our courts as an unquestioned part of the common law. He says (Â§ 1784), â€?thus it has been frequently held to be a misdemeanor, of the nature of malicious mischief, to kill an animal belonging to another, though it has never been held larceny so to kill and take unless some benefit was expected by the taker.â€?And he cites in support of such statement, among other cases, Commonwealth v. Leach, 1 Mass. 59; People v. Smith, 5 Cow. 258 ; Loomis v. Edgerton, 19 Wend. 420. The conclusion is sustained by the authorities.
It was a serious matter for the defendant whether he should be convicted of grand larceny upon facts which he claimed could only constitute malicious mischief. He had the right to have the distinction pointed out to the jury. He requested it, but it was not done. Thus the court-neglected and refused to point out the essential ingredient of the crime of grand larceny, whereby the defendant may have been convicted of a felony, while the facts arid the charge were equally applicable, to a misdemeanor. The learned county judge very properly and fully recognizes the serious importance of .this question, when he stays the execution of the senten'ce pending an appeal. There are various other questions presented, but it is unnecessary to consider them, sinc.e upon the point already discussed a new tidal must be granted. The judgment and conviction are reversed, and a new trial is granted.

1167676,PEOPLE v. SMITH,1884-02,"Rufus B. Cowing, City Judge.
In the month of May, 1880, the Grand Jury of this county found three indictments against the above- named defendant, for the crime of forgery in the third degree. In the following June, he was tried on one of these indictments, and found guilty, and sentenced to state prison for the term of five years; that being the maximum of punishment.
The defendant has served out his sentence, less the commutation allowed for good conduct; and was sometime last month, brought from Sing Sing prison on a bench warrant, and committed to the city prison, to be tried on the two other indictments.
The defendant now moves, that he be discharged from imprisonment, and that the indictments be dismissed.
It will be observed, that all the indictments were filed before the Code of Criminal Procedure became law; and, therefore, the motion must be disposed of by the rules and practice as they existed previous to the enactment of the said Code.
I have no power to dismiss the indictments, under the rules of practice, existing before the Code went into operation. For reasons, see my opinion in People v. Beckwith (ante, 29).
From the fact, that I sentenced the defendant for the maximum of punishment, upon his conviction in 1880, I am led to believe, that it was then understood, that he was not to be tried on the two other indictments. But whether this be so or not, I do not think that it is a wise or just practice to establish, where there are several indictments, for the people to allow years to elapse, between the trials on each. They should all be tried, when the witnesses are alive and accessible; and when the testimony for both sides is readily to be had.
The great object tp be obtained in punishing criminals, is to deter others, who may be inclined to commit like offenses; and this end is best accomplished, when the trial and punishment follow speedily, and when the facts and circumstances of the crime are fresh in the remembrance of the people.
In this age, and under our government, everything which savors of persecution should be frowned down. The defendant, during his life, may have done many criminal acts, and may be a very bad man; but he is not held to answer for anything â€?except these two remaining, untried indictments for forgery.
I think, that under all the circumstances, the defendant is entitled to be discharged from custody on his own recognizance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1167687,PEOPLE v. IRVING,1883-10,"Daniels, J.
The act for which the defendant was convicted was striking the complaining witness twice upon his head with a pistol, thereby cutting his head and inflicting a wound upon it about an inch and a half in length; and this was sufficient under the Penal Code to create the offense of an assault in the second degree, for that may be done by inflicting a wound â–?upon another with, or without, a weapon, or by the use of an instrument or thing likely to produce grievous bodily harm. Pen. Code, Â§ 218, subd. 3, 4.
And such an instrument as was in the hands of and used by the defendant would be likely when so Used to produce grievous bodily harm. Certainly there was such a degree of probability that it might be productive of that result as to require the case upon that point to be submitted, as it was upon the trial, to the consideration of the jury.
Upon the cross-examination of the defendant, who was sworn in his own behalf as a witness upon the trial, he was asked whether he had not committed other assaults at other times-upon other persons, and the questions propounded to him for that purpose were objected to-. T.he objection was overruled and exceptions to- the decisions were taken- These inquiries may very well have been suggested or induced by similar questions put to the complaining witness upon his cross-examination by the defendantâ€™s counsel. But while that might form such excuse for following the same course in the cross-examination of the defendant, it still would not justify the rulings which were made, if they were erroneous. And that they were erroneous may probably with safety be assumed; for while the defendant may be cross-examined as to other acts of misconduct not involved in the issue to'be tried which may affect his credit as a witness in the case, the inquiry should be limited to acts reasonably attended with that result. Brandon v. People, 42 N. Y. 265 ; Real v. People, Id. 270; People v. Brown, 72 Id 571; People v. Crapo, 76 Id. 288; Ryan v. People, 79 Id. 593. The cross-examination should be restricted to such acts as bear â€?directly upon the present character and moral principles of the witness, and therefore, essential to the due estimation of his testimony by the jury.â€?1 Greenl. Ev. 7th ed. Â§ 459. And that the defendant may have upon other occasions committed an assault upon other persons would not seem to' be within this principle, for the fact itself would not necessarily or properly tend to impeach his moral character or impair his credit as a witness. â€?But all, except two, of the inquiries made were answered in the negative by the defendant, and could not, therefore, have prejudiced him in the least upon the trial. In his answers to the other two he stated that he did strike the persons mentioned in the inquiries, and if the answers had ended there the case Avould probably have required another trial to correct this error. But it did not, for the defendant proceeded to state and explain the circumstances under which he struck these persons, showing that he was excusable for what he did. And in view of the explanations made, the fact that he did strike other persons on two different occasions could have had no effect Avhatever in the way of- prejudicing, the jury against him in this case. Whatever effect might otherwise have been given to the facts themselves was removed by the explanations Avhieli the witness added. In Nolan v. Brooklyn, etc. R. R. Co., 87 N. Y. 63, the witness was asked whether he had not been expelled from the Fire Department, and the court held the question to be â€?improper, because the fact sought to he proved was neither pertinent to the issue, nor did it relate to any specific fact which tended to discredit the witness or impeach his moral character.â€?But inasmuch as he added an explanation of the cause of his removal relieving him from the charge of misconduct, it was held that the error was productive of no injurious effect, and, therefore, should form no ground for the reversal of the judgment. Ib. 68. By section 542 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the observance of this principle has now been positively enjoined upon the courts. For it has been provided that after hearing the appeal, the court must give judment without regard to technical errors, or defects, or to exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties. Those which have been considered are exceptions of this description. As the answers were explained they did not affect any substantial right of the defendant in this case.
The evidence was such as to require the court to submit the case to the jury. Their verdict was reasonably well supported, by it, and the judgment in the case should be affirmed.

1167679,PEOPLE v. MARTIN,1883-01,"Rufus B. Cowing, City Judge.
On November 20, 1883, an indictment was filed in this court, charging the defendant, Lewis B. Martin, and others, with forgery in the first degree.
The defendant, Martin, demurs to the indictment, for the reason, as alleged, that the indictment does not contain sufficient facts to constitute a crime; in that it does not set forth the name of the person whom the defendants intended to have defrauded, or assign any reason for the omission. The people have joined in the demurrer; and this court is called upon to settle the question of law thus raised.
On the argument, the counsel for the defendant conceded, that the indictment sufficiently charges forgery in the first degree against the defendant, if subdivision 5 of section 718, of the Penal Code, is constitutional. This subdivision reads as follows: â€?Where an intent _ to defraud constitutes a part of a crime, it is not necessary to aver or prove an intent to defraud any particular person.â€?In my judgment, the above section of the Penal Code is constitutional; and, therefore, the indictment need not allege an intent, on the part of the defendant, to defraud any particular person, but only to defraud in general.
The statutory definition recites the general intent to defraud; and the evident intent of one who commits forgery is general, for his intent undoubtedly is, to defraud any one upon whom he can put off his forged writing or instrument.
The defendant who commits forgery intends to defraud any one he can, without knowing at the time who it will be. I can see no injustice to the defendant, in making his intent, by way of allegation, as general, as is his intent, in point of fact.
To be sure, the defendant is entitled to know the nature of the charge made against him : first, that he may know exactly what he is called upon to defend himself against, and to be prepared to meet, upon his trial; and second, that he maybe able to plead the indictment, when he is called upon a second time to defend himself against the same charge. .
In my opinion this indictment is sufficiently definite to meet both of these requisites.
I know of nothing, either in the constitution of this state, or in that of the United States, restricting the legislature in determining what acts shall constitute a crime or in determining, by way of procedure, what the indictment should contain, to properly set it forth; so long as it contains sufficient of allegation to warn the defendant of the nature of the accusation made against him, and to enable him to prepare his defense, and to use the indictment as a bar to a second prosecution fpr the same offense. I consider this indictment sufficiently definite to meet all these requirements.
Judgment is ordered for the people upon the demurrer, and the defendant is allowed to answer over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1167709,PEOPLE v. BOYLE,1884-01,"Rufus B. Cowing, City Judge.
It appears from the complaint upon which the proceedings were initiated, that the defendant, on the 18th of December, 1883, threatened to kill the complainant, his wife; and by the commitment, that the magistrate, before whom the proceedings were pending, committed the defendant to the city prison in default of bail, until he should be discharged by due course of law.
The counsel for the defendant claims and insists that this court is the proper forum for him to move for his discharge; while the district attorney insists that this court, under the circumstances, has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the motion.
Where a person has been arrested for threatening a breach of the peace, and has given an undertaking, as required by section 89 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, there can be no doubt but that this court has jurisdiction to discharge the defendant under certain circumstances ; but I fail to find any where, in sections 84 to 99 inclusive, any express authority given to this court to entertain jurisdiction of the proceeding, where the defendant has been committed by the magistrate, in default of the giving the undertaking required by section 89.
Under the law of this State, as it existed before the Code, and as declared in the Revised Statutes, when a person was arrested and brought before the magistrate, charged with threatening a breach of the peace, Colby says, at pages 84 and 85 of his work, that there is no examination, or trial, of the party arrested; and that he is not permitted to be heard, either personally or by counsel; he must either enter into the undertaking or be committed. But sections 87 and 88, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, have changed the law; so that the magistrate may proceed io examine the charge, and determine upon evidence, whether it is well founded, or not; and if not, may discharge the defendant.
It may be, that the legislature intended that this court should have power, to discharge the defendant, where he is committed for want of filing the undertaking, required by section 89, the same as where the undertaking is given. But if so intended, I find it nowhere so expressed, in words ; and therefore, inasmuch as it appears, that the defendant stands committed in default of giving the undertaking, required by section 89 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, I have come to the conclusion, that this court has no power to discharge the defendant. The motion is denied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1167685,PEOPLE v. BORK,1884-01,"Hardin, J.
Section 542 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows: â€?After hearing the appeal, the court must give judgment without regard to technical errors or defects, or to exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.â€?This section was adopted to prevent technical errors or defects from defeating the ends of justice. And all such errors or defects as do not affect the substantial rights of the parties complaining, the court must disregard, in considering the case before it upon appeal.
It is now urged that since the amendment of section 23 of the-Code of Criminal Procedure in 1882, a court of Oyer and Terminer is held by a justice of the Supreme Court without an associate (laws 1882, ch. 360). We held in Ostrander v. People, 29 Hun, 519; 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 274, that after the passage of the act of 1882, there was no law authorizing justices of Sessions to sit in the Oyer and Terminer. Our decision in that case was subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
We may properly assume that when the Oyer and Terminer of May 3,1883, was opened, and a justice of this court appeared and presided, a regular court was held, as the law authorizes.
It is a universal presumption in respect to judicial proceedings, criminal as well as civil, that they have been conducted according to' law, unless the contrary is clearly made to appear. The law also presumes that judicial officers have discharged their duties according to the requirements of the law, until the contrary appears. In the case in hand, the court of Oyer and Terminer appears to have been presided over by a justice of this court in the proper place, and in the proper building for-holding courts of Oyer and Terminer in Erie county. Such court had jurisdiction of the subject matter and the person-of the defendant, as the record before us shows, and nothing to the1 contrary is shown or claimed by the defendant. If we grant that the caption contains a recital not authorized by the law, may it not be disregarded as surplusage, and at most showing a technical error â€?which does not affect the substantial rights ofâ€?the defendant \ When he appeared in the court on the 3d day of May, 1883, he did not object to the jurisdiction of the court, nor that it was not holden on the proper authority. Strengthening the presumption that the officer authorized by law to hold a court of Oyer and Terminer did then and there discharge his duty, is the absence of an objection or exception to the proceedings then had. For the first time, the objection to the organization of the court on the 3d day of May, 1883, is taken after the â–?court has completed its duty in the premises. The defendant apparently was silent, acquiescing in the proceedings as conducted by the court, when the sentence was pronounced.
We incline to the opinion that the remarks of Judge Andrews in People v. Cornetti, 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 306 ; 92 N. Y. 88, are applicable here. That judge said as follows: â€?It is claimed that the court of Oyer and Terminer, by which the prisoner was tried, was not legally constituted, the allegation being that the justices'of Sessions, who in part composed it, were not legally designated"" or elected. This point is taken here for the first time. It was not raised at the trial, and there is no evidence, and no exception bearing upon it. It must be assumed, therefore, that the court was properly constituted, and that the justices of Sessions who acted, were duly designated according to law.â€?Again, in People v. Hovey, 92 N. Y. 554; 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 287, the court, in considering when an exception should be taken, says: â€?An exception to a charge taken after a criminal trial has terminated, and where, if erroneous, the jury could not have been instructed to disregard the erroneous instructions, does not present any question for the. consideration of 'an appellate court.â€?This case differs from those decided 'before the adoption of section 542, which cases relate tp mere irregularities. Here we have a court in which sat a justice of this court, clothed with full power to conduct the court, and such court, the record says, imposed a sentence, without any objection or exception being taken thereto. In Commissioners of Highways v. The Judges, 7 Wend. 264, it was said by the court that the fact that the certificate was made by twenty freeholders did not vitiate it, though only twelve were required by the statute ; and in the same case Judge Melson said: â€œThe objection that one of the judges who decided the appeal had before passed upon the same questions might be considered as warranted by the provision of the statutes forbidding officers acting in appellate tribunals from taking part in the decision of matters before determined by them (2 R. S. 275, Â§ 3), hail it been urged when the question was under .consideration before the judges; but it was not. The appeal was contested solely upon its merits, and the commissioners are now too late to avail themselves of the objection. It might have been and probably was waived. It would promote litigation and contravene well established principles, -now to allow it as well taken.â€?We think we must obey the letter and spirit of section 542 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and that to do so, we should sustain the judgment befÃ³le us. (2) The opinion of Barker, J., as to the questions made as to the form of the verdict meets with our approval. (3) The views already expressed lead to an affirmance of the order refusing a discharge of the prisoner on a writ of habeas corpus.
Judgment affirmed, order denying motion for arrest of judgment affirmed, and order refusing a discharge of prisoner affirmed.
Smith, P. J., concurs.
Barker, J.
The indictment on which the defendant was tried and convicted, is based upon charges which constituted a violation of the provisions of chapter 19, of the Laws of 1875, entitled, â€?An act to provide more effectually for the punish-, ment of peculation and other wrongs affecting public moneys and rights of property.â€?The property and funds wrongfully and illegally converted by the appellant to his own use as described in the indictment consisted of one hundred bonds issued i>y the city of Buffalo, known as the city and county Hall Bonds of the denomination of one thousand dollars each, and of the value of one thousand dollars each, the property of the city of Buffalo.
A more particular reference to the indictment and statement of the nature of the offense described is unnecessary for the purposes of this appeal.
The trial on the indictment was had at a court of Oyer and Terminer held in and for Erie county, in May, 1881, Mr. Justice' Dahiels, presiding, and the justices of Sessions sitting and acting as his associates. The form of the verdict as rendered by the jury and recorded by the clerk was that the prisoner is â€?guilty of the crime as charged in the indictment.â€?Before sentence, was pronounced on the conviction a stay was granted, and the rulings made on the trial, to which the defendant took exceptions, were reviewed in this court and in the Court of Appeals on a bill of exceptions, and in both courts the conviction was sustained and"" a new trial denied. â–?On filing a remittitur from the Court of Appeals with the clerk of Erie county, the order and judgments of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals were made the judgment of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, thereupon and on the 9th day of April, 1883, the defendant moved in arrest of judgment, which motion was denied. The record before us does not disclose the grounds upon which the motion in arrest of judgment was founded. At a subsequent day and on the 3d day of May, 1883, at,a term of the court of Oyer and Terminer, held in and for Erie county, judgment was pronounced on the verdict and the prisoner was sentenced to be confined in the Auburn prison at hard labor for the term of five years.
One of the grounds upon which the appellant now seeks to reverse the judgment is, that unauthorized persons, to wit: the justices of Sessions in. and for the county of Erie, were present and acted as members of the court of Oyer and Terminer, when the sentence was made up and judgment pronounced against the prisoner. If such be the fact and the same is made to appear by the record then the judgment is illegal and void and the prisoner is suffering punishment administered by a tribunal unknown to the law of the land.
Formerly courts of Oyer and Terminer as organized under the judiciary act (Laws of 1847) except in the city and county of Mew York, were composed of a justice of the Supreme Court, who presided, the county judge and the justices of the peace designated as members of the court of Sessions; with a provision that the presiding justice and any two of the other officers mentioned therein, constituted a quorum and had power to hold a court. In June 1882, the organization of the court was changed a'nd the court as now constituted consists of a justice of the Supreme Court without any associates ; the words of the enactment being- as follows:â€?â€?A court of Oyer and Terminer is held by a justice of the Supreme Court, without an associate.â€â€”Section 23 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as amended by chapter 360, Laws of 1882.
An inspection of the record as set forth in the appeal book, discloses the fact, that when Bork was sentenced there were present and acting as members of the court and participating in its deliberation, other persons than the justice of the Supreme Court who then presided.
In the papers embraced in the judgment roll is a copy of the minutes of the trial; a copy of the minutes of the motion made in arrest of judgment; a copy of the minutes of the judgment as directed and required by section 483 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the caption of the clerkâ€™s minutes, as kept by him on the day the prisoner was sentenced, in a statement of the persons who were present and acting as members of the court, the whole is as follows:
â€?At a court of Oyer and Terminer held at the City and County Hall, in the City of Buffalo in and for the County of Erie, on the 3d day of May 1883. Present, Hon. Charles Daniels, Justice, presiding. Hon. Fayette Read and Seth A. Abbott, Justices of Sessions.â€?Then follows the judgment as prepared by the clerk and signed by him, the caption of which is in the following words, viz.:
â€?State of Hew York. At a court of Oyer and Terminer held at the City and County Hall in the City of Buffalo, in and for the County of Erie on the third day of May 1883. Present: Hon. Charles Daniels, Justice presiding, and Hon. Fayette Bead and Seth A. Abbott, Justices of the Sessions.â€?The judgment, after making the usual formal recitals referring to the indictment, trial and conviction, concludes in these words: â€œAnd (Bork) was thereupon, on the 3rd day of May? 1883, sentenced to be imprisoned in the State Prison at Auburn at hard labor, for the term of five years. J. E. Ewell, Clerk.â€?In all courts of record in this state, it is the province as well as the duty of the clerk, to keep a minute-book or record of the proceedings of the court, in which he states the day of trial, the name of the judge who presides, and also the names of his ^associates, when he has any, and this book, with all its entries, is, as a general rule under the complete control of the court to which such entries relate.
We must conclude, therefore, when the prisoner was sentenced that Fayette Bead and Seth A. Abbott, two persons not legally members of the court of Oyer and Terminer, were present and acting as members of the court and deliberated with Mr. Justice Daniels, in preparing the judgment, which they together, all acting as members of the court, pronounced on the prisoner. These individuals were judicial officers, the members of another tribunal. We may take judicial notice of the fact who are the members of the several courts of record in this state, and it is for us to understand from the record before us, that these individuals were the justices of the peace designated as members of the Court of Sessions in and for the county of Erie, at the time judgment was pronounced in this case. As such officers were formerly members of the court of Oyer and Terminer and the change in the organization of the court had then but recently taken place, this circumstance most likely explains why they deemed in their duty and were permitted to act as members of the court when Bork was sentenced. Although the trial took place before the court as organized under the judiciary act, the judgment on the verdict should have been pronounced by the court organized as the statute now provides. Ostrander v. People, 29 Hun, 513; 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 274.
The legal proposition presented by the learned counsel for the appellant, that the judgment is void for the reason the court was not legally constituted,-does not, in my opinion, admit of any doubt. The court had jurisdiction of the subject matter as well as the person of the prisoner; the trial and conviction were regular in all respects, and free from error. The question under consideration does not, accurately speaking, involve the jurisdiction of the court in which he was tried and sentenced. The precise question is, was the court legally-organized when the judgment was pronounced. If there is anything settled in the jurisprudence of this state it is, that no man shall be condemned and punished by the judgment of an unauthorized tribunal.
â€?To create a judicial tribunal is one of the functions of government, and it is against public policy to recognize judgments and decrees of a self-constituted court. In civil actions the judgments of unauthorized judicatories are sometimes held binding on suitors as mere arbitrations, when the proceedings are conducted with their consent, but never in criminal prosecutions, for the punishment that follows a. conviction, may, and often does involve life and liberty, and is not limited to the loss of property. It is a maxim of the law that consent never confers jurisdiction. This applies as well to consent which Creates a tribunal, as to that which submits matter to a subsisting tribunal which is an utter stranger to it. Germond v. People, 1 Hill, 345.
A court is as much disorganized and without power to act, when one or more unauthorized individuals participate in its deliberations and judgments as when it acts without the presence of those who are necessary to constitute a quorum as required by some provision of positive law.
The cases which I will now mention prove, as far as judicial decision can establish any proposition, that the tribunal which pronounced judgment against the prisoner on the verdict of conviction, was illegally constituted and unknown to the law of the land.
In Oakley v. Aspinwall, 3 N. Y. 547, it was held, that if one of the members of a court is disqualified to sit in a particular case, by reason of his consanguinity to one of the suitors, he cannot properly and legally act as a member of the court, though it should be with the express consent of all the parties in interest.
This rule was applied in that case where one of the members of the Court of Appeals was disqualified by reason of his relationship to one of the parties, although all the parties gave express consent and requested the disqualified judge to sit, and there was in fact a quorum of the court without his presence. The judgment in which he participated was declared void and vacated on motion. In the opinion of the court, the statute on the subject of the disqualification of judges was quoted, and the provision of the statute is: â€?Â¡No. judge of any .court can.sit as such in any cause to which he is a party, or in which he is interested, or in which. he would, be excluded from being a juror by reason of consanguinity or affinity to either-of the parties.â€?2 R. S. 275, Â§ 2; Reviserâ€™s Notes, 3 R. S. 694.
The court, in remarking upon the rule of the common law and the provisions of the statute, says, viz.: â€?.After so plain a prohibition, can anything more be necessary .to prevent a judge from retaining his seat ip the cases specified % He is first excluded by the moral .sense of all mankind; the common law next denies the right to sit,, and then the revisers of our law declared that they intended to embody this universal sentiment in the form of a statutory prohibition,, and so they placed this explicit provision before'the legislature, who adopted it without alteration and enacted it as the law. The exclusion wrought by it is as complete as is, jn the nature pf the case, possible. The judge is removed from the cause, and from the bench ; or if he will occupy the latter, it must 1)6 only as an idle spectator, and not as a judge. He cannot sit as .such. The spirit and language of the law are against it. Having disqualified him from sitting as a judge, the statute further declares that he can neither decide nor take part in the decision of the causes, as to which he is divested of the judicial function. Nor ought he to wait to be put in mind of his disability, but should himself suggest it and withdraw, as the judge with great propriety attempted to do in the present case. He cannot sit, says the statute. It is a legal impossibility, ,and so the courts have held it.â€?Edwards v. Russell, 21 Wend. 63; Foot v. Morgan, 1 Hill, 654,
The statute applicable to the case we have in hand declares : The court of Oyer and Terminer shall be held by a justice of the Supreme Court without an associate.
In the case of the People v. Shaw, 63 N. Y. 36, it was held that if a quorum of- the court, as. provided -by -the statute which created it was not present when the verdict of the jury was received, it was error, and the judgment pronounced thereon was reversed. In the opinion of- the. Supreme Court, the same view was taken, and is reported in 3 Hun, 272.
In Cancemiâ€™s case, 18 N. Y. 128, he.consented to be-tried by a -jury of eleven qualified jurors, and- was convicted of the crime of murder. The Supreme Court sustained the conviction on the ground that the prisoner could waive his constitutional right to be tried by a jury of twelve.
The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment, and set aside the conviction, and ordered a new trial, holding that the prisoner could not waive his right to be tried by a jury composed of the number provided by the constitution of the State, and the verdict of conviction was a nullity. The court further held that when an issue was joined on an indictment, the trial must be by the tribunal and in the mode which the constitution and the laws provided, without any essential change, that the public officer prosecuting for the people has no authority to consent to such a change, nor has the defendant.
On the authority of these cases, the judgment appealed from must be held erroneous and void. The following cases are cited as authority on these propositions. Blend v. People, 41 N. Y. 604; People v. Dohring, 59 N. Y. 374; Hinman v. People, 13 Hun, 266 ; Chambers v. Clearwater, 1 Keyes, 310; Foot v. Morgan, 1 Hill, 654; Germon v. People, 1 Id. 345; People ex rel. Tweed v. Liscomb, 60 N. Y. 571.
As the defect in the organization of the court deprived it of the character intended by the law creating it, this court must take notice of the defect, although the appellant on this appeal for the first time makes the objection to the validity of the sentence. 92 N. Y. 144; 1 N. Y. Crim. 244.
For the reason that the judgment is a nullity, it cannot stand, and must be reversed. The question now arises, whether this court has the power to give a new judgment on the verdict, and if not, must the record be remitted to the Oyer and Terminer, with directions to proceed on the conviction, and pronounce the appropriate sentence on the verdict, or should the judgment be reversed and a new trial ordered, or the prisoner absolutely discharged ? The Code of Criminal Procedure has abolished writs of error, and substituted an appeal as the only mode of reviewing a judgment in a criminal action. Section 515.
As the judgment in this action was pronounced after the Code went into operation, the record is brought before us on appeal as provided by section 517. By the Revised Statutes, as amended by chapter 226, Laws of 1863, relating to writs of error in criminal cases, it was provided :â€?â€?If the Supreme Court shall affirm such judgment, it shall direct the sentence pronounced to be executed, and the. same shall be executed accordingly. If the Supreme Court shall reverse the judgment rendered, it shall either direct a new trial, or that the defendant be absolutely discharged, according to the circumstances of the case; provided, however, that the appellate court shall have power upom any writ of error, when it shall appear that the conviction has been legal and regular to remit the record to the court in which such conviction was had, to pass sentence thereon as the said appellate court shall direct.â€?2 R. S. Â§ 24, marginal page 471.
There can be no doubt but that this section is repealed and the provisions of the Code on the same subject substituted in lieu thereof. Section 962 declares that the provisions of the Code apply to criminal actions and to all other proceedings in criminal cases, which are therein provided for from the time when the same took effect (which was September 1, 1881). That all such actions and proceedings theretofore commenced must be conducted in the same manner as if the Code had not been passed. Although this action was commenced and a trial had before the Code went into operation, the provisions of the same, relating to giving judgment on appeal are applicable, because the judgment on the verdict and the appeal therefrom, are proceedings in the action instituted after the Code took effect, and are not such proceedings as are embraced in the exception as mentioned in the section.
Entertaining jurisdiction on this appeal at the instance of the appellant, is giving a construction to the statute in accordance with these views. Chapter 4 of the Criminal Code contains provisions relating to the power of the appellate court to give judgment on disposing of the appeal. The directions are,- after hearing the appeal, the court must give judgment, without regard to technical errors or to exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties. The next section (see. 543) provides: â€œUpon hearing theâ€˜appeal the appellate court may in cases where an erroneous judgment has been rendered upon a lawful verdict, correct the judgment to conform to the verdict; in all other cases they must either reverse or affirm the judgment appealed from, and in case of reversal may, if necessary or proper, order a new trial.â€?If the judgment against the defendant be reversed without ordering a new trial, the appellate court must direct his discharge. If the judgment be affirmed the original judgment must be carried into execution as the appellate court may direct and if the judgment be corrected, the corrected judgment must be carried into execution as the appellate court may direct.
There is also the further provision, that, when a judgment in the appellate court is given, it must be entered in the judgment book and a certified copy of the entry forthwith remitted to the clerk, with whom the original roll is filed, and the papers returned to the appellate court must there remain a record and not be remitted to the court below.
The verdict in this case was, in every respect, valid and legal, and I am of the opinion that the judgment pronounced thereon is void. The question now arises, has this court, on correcting the error and setting aside the void judgment, the power and authority to pronounce an appropriate judgment on the verdict as it stands ? I am of the opinion that the provisions of the Criminal Code which we have mentioned, confer such power, and that it is our duty to give the judgment which the law pronounces on the verdict.
Prior to the act of 1863, if an erroneous judgment was pronounced on a legal and regular conviction, on the trial of a good indictment, and the judgment was reversed on a writ of error in an appellate court, such court had no power to remit the proceedings to the court below to proceed on the verdict and give the appropriate judgment, nor could the appellate court give a new judgment, but, under the provisions of the statute and the law as it then stood, the defendant was entitled to an absolute discharge on a reversal of the judgment which had been given against him. Shepherd v. People, 25 N. Y. 406; McKee v. People, 32 Id. 239; Ratzky v. People, 29 Id. 127; People v. Taylor, 3 Denio, 97; Oâ€™Leary v. People, 4 Park. Cr. 187.
The decision in People v. Shepherd was founded on the idea that there was not, previous-to the act of 1863, any authority in the appellate court on the reversal of a judgment wrongfully pronounced when the trial and conviction was regular, either to pronounce the proper judgment or to remit the record to the court where sentence was pronounced, with directions to that court to pass the appropriate sentence, and that in the absence of any such authority upon the reversal of the judgment, the prisoner was entitled to his discharge.
It was, as we think, the clear intent of the legislature, in amending section 24 of the Revised Statutes, by adding the provision contained in the act of 1863, to retain the verdict when the trial and conviction were jugular and legal on a good indictment, when the judgment was reversed and ,set aside, because of some error in the form or substance thereof. To accomplish this end, specific power was given the appellate court to formulate the appropriate judgment arid .to remit it, with the record to the court in which conviction was had-, with directions to pass sentence on the verdict in the form and to the effect as prepared by the appellate court.
In Ratzkyâ€™s case, the judgment was reversed because of error in the form and effect of the same, and as no error occurred on the trial, and the indictment was good and' sufficient, the Court of Appeals prepared the judgment which should be pronounced on the verdict and sent the same with the record to the court below, to be pronounced on the defendant.
If we were reviewing the judgment in this case, on a writ of error, issued under the provisions of the Revised Statutes, we should not, on reversing the judgment, discharge the defendant nor award him a new trial, but should formulate a new sentence and direct the Oyer and Terminer to pronounce the same.
We are entirely satisfied that it was the purpose of the legislature in adopting, sections 242 and 243 of the Criminal Code, to keep and preserve the verdict in all cases where the same is lawful, and if an erroneous judgment' has been pronounced thereon by the trial court, on appeal therefrom, then,- that the appellate court should give the proper judgment.
There is no provision in the statute as it now stands for remitting the record to the- court below, with directions to that-court to proceed anew and pronounce the appropriate sentence. Without a statute on the subject conferring the power,' this court is without authority to give such directions, and the court below has none to proceed anew on the subject. Unless the statute does confer on this court the power to give a new judgment on the reversal of an erroneous one when the verdict is lawful, then, in every such case the defendant is entitled to an absolute discharge, for the reason that the trial and conviction already had, would be a complete bar to another trial and conviction.
Authority, full and complete, is conferred on this court to correct an erroneous judgment, and to conform it to the judgment when the judgment is lawful. But it is said, as this judgment is void, it cannot correctly be held erroneous, within the meaning of the statute, so as to bring the same within its provisions.
I do not concur in the suggestion, and on the contrary believe the judgment erroneous as well as void, within the sense and meaning of the statute, so that we may give the appropriate judgment on the verdict. A judgment may be erroneous and not void, and it may be erroneous because it is void. It is within the power of the legislature to confer on a court the right to pronounce sentence on a verdict convicting the accused.
A judgment now given by this court on the verdict will be, it is true, a new judgment, to stand in the place of the present void judgment. So are all corrected and modified judgments in criminal or civil actions, in a certain sense, new judgments. Suppose a sentence wholly unauthorized by law be pronounced on a legal verdict, by a competent and duly organized court, the same is erroneous and void, for the reason that the same is without sanction of law. On appeal therefrom, this court has the undoubted right under the provisions of the present statutes to correct the same and conform it to the verdict. In doing this, the court does make up and give a new judgment in every respect. Ho part or feature of the void judgment can be retained,
The judgment now under consideration is erroneous and void in the same sense as in the case supposed, but for a different reason. The phrase â€?erroneous judgment,â€?as used in section 543, should be considered to embrace void judgments, as well as those which are merely erroneous, and the power to correct judgments and conform them to the verdict should be held to include those that are erroneous, because they are void. It cannot be doubted, but such was the intention of the legislature. It cannot reasonably be supposed that the legislature was ignorant of the well-established rule of law, that, if there has been a legal conviction on a good indictment, the accused cannot be re-tried on the same indictment after an erroneous judgment on the verdict has been reversed and set aside; nor can it be believed* that in codifying the law on this subject, it did not intend to preserve the provisions of the Revised Statutes, conferring on courts of review the power to give a proper judgment on a legal verdict on reversing an erroneous and void one, and thus to secure the punishment of guilty persons who have been legally convicted, and not allow law-breakers to escape altogether by reason of error in pronouncing the judgment of the law on a just conviction.
The form of the verdict is set forth in the record, and if for any reason the same is incomplete and does not pass upon all the issues as required by the statute, the question was propperly brought to the attention of the trial court on the motion in arrest of judgment. It is now argued that the motion should have been allowed and the judgment arrested for the reason, that the verdict did not contain any finding or statement of the loss sustained from the offense committed by the defendant as required by the statute under which the indictment was found.
It is not claimed by the learned counsel for the defendant, that a request was made on the trial by the people or the defendant, that the jury find and state with their verdict the amount of the loss sustained by the city. The fact which may be found by the jury under the statute, is no part of the verdict. It must be stated with the verdict, when the fact is the language of the statute being; â€?when rendering a verdict of guilty, upon the trial of any pei'son indicted under the act, the jury may find and state with their verdict, the amount of loss resulting from the offense of the defendant.â€?I am unable to discover that it was the intention of the legislature, that in every distance where a . conviction takes place, that the jury must pass on the question of loss, and consequently hold that, if there be omission so to do, the verdict is incomplete and for that reason a mis-trial must be adjudged. The statute is not imperative and peremptory in terms; the language is permissive. Although the act relates wholly to matters of public concern, this provision of the statute should not be regarded as imperative. Should the defendant plead guilty, he would then be legally convicted and the court could lawfully pronounce sentence, without any finding by a jury as to the extent of the loss.
Let it be conceded that this provision of the statute was inserted solely in the interest of the- accused, that does not seem to be a sufficient reason for requiring the construction to be given to the statute, making it the duty of the court on every trial, to require the jury to pass on the question of loss.
This is like the case where the sheriff or other officer is empowered to let to bail. Before such an officer is derelict in duty, he must be required to perform, tbe-duty required",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1167726,MATTER OF McDONALD,1884-03,"Westbrook, J.
William McDonald, who. is confined in the jail of Albany county, through and by the writ of habeas corpus asks his discharge from such imprisonment.
The writ was allowed by the Hon. William L. Learned, one of the justices of the Supreme Court of this state, and was made returnable at the court of Oyer and Terminer, then in session in the county of Albany, as the law required. 2 Edm. Stat. 784, Â§ 227; People ex rel. Phelps v. Fancher, 2 Hun, 226, 236, 237.
The petition and return show the cause and circumstances of the commitment of McDonald to be as follows:
On the 14th day of January, 1884, the senate of the state of Mew York passed the following preamble and resolution:
â€?Whereas, Grave charges of fraud and irregularities have been made from time to- time by the public press, and recently, by the Union League Club of the city of Mew York, against Hubert O. Thompson, commissioner of public works in the city of Mew York; and
â€?Whereas, These charges have, in the opinion of many persons, never been satisfactorily explained and fairly refuted; and
â€?Whereas, It is of vital importance to all the taxpayers of this state that the heads of all public departments should be beyond- reproach ; therefore be it
â€?Hesolved, That the standing committee on the affairs of cities of this senate be, and it hereby is, directed and empowered to investigate the Department of Public Works in the city of Mew York, with power to send for persons and papers, and said committee is hereby authorized to employ a stenographer and such counsel and accountants as it may deem necessary for the thorough discharge of the duties hereby imposed. Such committee to report the result of such investigation and its-recommendations concerning the same to the senate on or before the fifteenth day of April next.â€?During the month of February succeeding the date of the passage of the resolution just given, William McDonald, in obedience to its subpoena, appeared before the senate committee as a witness, and was examined at considerable length in regard to materialâ€”gravel, limestone chips, &c.â€”which he had furnished to the city. The witness, through his counsel, who appeared, as the committee held, only by its courtesy and not by right, refused and declined to answer sundry questions designed to ascertain where he had obtained the materials furnished to the city by him, and also other questions concerning his business as a dealer in coal. The witness finally, by advice of counsel, retired from the presence of the committee and refused to be further examined.
The senate committee reported the conduct of the witness to the senate, and on the 27th day of February, 1884, in pursuance of its resolution and by force of its warrant issued to its sergeant-at-arms, McDonald was brought before the senate to answer for his alleged contempt in refusing to answer the questions propounded by the committee, and in leaving the presence of the committee after a refusal to submit to a further examination. Upon his arraignment before the senate McDonald was heard by counsel, and the result was the adoption of a resolution by the senate on the 28th day of February, 1884, adjudging him to be in contempt for refusing to answer the questions asked by its committee, and for refusing to submit to a further examination by and before such committee, and sentencing him to imprisonment in the Albany county jail until he should submit himself to be examined by such committee, and in case of his refusal so to do, the imprisonment to continue until the final adjournment of the legislature. Under such resolution McDonald was remanded to the custody of the sergeant-at-arms, who was directed to deliver him to the sheriff of Albany county, to be confined by said sheriff in the common jail of such county â€?until the final adjournment of the present legislature, unless sooner discharged by order of the senate.â€?After the adoption of the resolution by the senate McDonald was again brought to its bar, and was informed, by the president of its sentence. The senate then issued its warrant under its seal, signed by its president and clerk, reciting the proceedings had before it, and directing the imprisonment of McDonald in conformity with its sentence, under which warrant he is now imprisoned in the Albany jail, and which warrant is returned to the court as the sole cause and ground of imprisonment.
Preliminary to the statement of the question which this proceeding presents, it is proper to observe that, in support of the legality of the imprisonment of McDonald, it is not urged that either the senate-or the legislature had any judicial control over the incumbent of the office of commissioner of public works of the city of New York. Neither could punish him for crime nor remove him for cause. It could, however, initiate legislation concerning the office, and thus, with the concurrent action of the assembly, and the approval of the governor, remedy any deficiencies in the statutes regulating the office, and by force of legal enactment provide for the removal of the commissioner and for the selection of another individual to fill his place. It was strongly urged upon the argument in behalf of McDonald that the resolution of the senate does not contemplate any legislative action whatever, but only and solely an investigation as to the guilt of the commissioner of the charges which are recited in the resolution. The adoption of this view, however, as it imputes to the senate an assumption of power, is forbidden by the respect for that high and dignified body which should be cherished and observed by every judge. It will be assumed therefore that the inquiry which the resolution authorized was to be conducted for a legitimate and proper purpose, and that when the senate directed its committee â€?to report the result of such investigation, and its recommendations concerning the same,â€?it intended thereby that such committee should report what legislation was, in its judgment, required to remedy evils or abuses, if any such were found.
From this narrative of fact it is evident that the question submitted is not, can the legislature, or either branch thereof, in execution and discharge of judicial functions (and there are some of that character expressly conferred by the constitution of the state, such as, â€œEach house shall ... be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members,â€?of the assembly to impeach, of the senate to remove from office, upon the recommendation of the governor, etc.), punish for contempt \ Mor is it: Oan either house in aid of legislation examine witnesses on oath, a right though most seriously questioned in a recent ease by the supreme court of the United States (Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U. S. 168-189) ? But it is this: Can either one of the two houses comprising the legislature of the state, through the authority which it undertakes to confer upon a committee, and by the agency of such committee, obtain and compel the testimony of individuals, supposed to be needed for the purpose of legislation, and on the refusal of any individual to attend as a witness and to give evidence, punish him for the alleged offense or crime of so refusing ?
The question is certainly a grave one, and one which has never before in this state been so directly and flatly presented to a court for adjudication as now. It involves a careful study of the effect of the lodgment of the executive, legislative and judicial powers of the state in distinct and different departments, and the restraints thereby imposed upon legislative power, the inherent or inherited prerogatives of the legislature, or of either house thereof, and the necessary limitations upon all power under a republican system of government. The discussion and consideration should be conducted with a sincere respect for that body in which, together with the assembly, by the constitution of the state, it is declared, â€?the legislative power of this state shall be vested,â€?and with an honest desire to preserve to it all its rights and privileges, but yet with a determination also to preserve to each great department of the government of the state the power lodged by the constitution therein, the preservation of which to each is vital to the liberties and rights of the people of this commonwealth. -
With the spirit just indicated the examination of the question is approached, and in the forefront of inquiry is another query to be answered, upon the true solution of which the correct answer to the other must largely depend, and it is this : Was the power which the senate exercised over McDonald judicial or legislative in its character ?
In answering this question it is necessary to bear in mind not only the fact of the imprisonment of McDonald, but also the language of the order or resolution which commanded such imprisonment, to the end that the true nature and character of the power assumed may appear. The resolution recites that he had â€?been declared to be guilty of a contempt of the senate,â€?and was â€?convicted thereof.â€?It then states the particular contempt of which he was â€?declared . . . guilty,â€?and of which he had been â€?convicted,â€?and then proceeds to announce the punishment to be imprisonment, as hereinbefore stated, and which is preceded by the words â€?is hereby sentenced.â€?The language of the president of the senate in communicating to McDonald the determination of that body is also equally significant, as to the character of the power it claimed to exercise. He said, after stating the offense of which McDonald had been adjudged guilty: â€?It becomes my duty to communicate to you, at this time, th& judgment or punishment the senate has seen fit to impose upon you for the offense which you have committed.â€?This declaration is followed by an enunciation of â€?the judgment or sentence â€?imposed by the senate.
From the foregoing statements of facts, it is apparent that the senate ""summoned McDonald to answer for an offense ; that after a hearing or trial upon which he was represented by counsel, it declared him â€?to be guilty â€?and â€?convictedâ€?him â€?thereof,â€?and then â€?sentenced â€?him to â€?the judgment or punishment â€?of imprisonment in the county jail of Albany county, where he is now detained, and where he must continue, unless relieved by this proceeding, â€?until the final adjournment of the present legislature, unless sooner discharged by order of the senate.â€?It needs no elaborate argument to prove that this was the exercise of judicial and not of legislative power. This conclusion follows inevitably from the conceded truth that while it 'is the prerogative of the legislature, as a general rule, only to enact laws, and thus to declare what acts shall be deemed criminal, subject, however, to the restraints of the fundamental law, it is also, as a general rule, the prerogative of courts alone to interpret the laws, and to apply and enforce their remedies, either as between individuals or as between the state and parties subject thereto. There is, however, no occasion for abstract reasoning upon this point, as in the recent case of Kilbourn v. Thompson (103 U. S. 168-193), precisely the power which the senate has exercised, of general inquiry by a committee and the punishment as for a contempt of a person refusing to testify, was held to be â€œjudicial and not legislative.â€?See also Kielley v. Carson, 4 Moore's P. C. 62, 89, 80 ; Fenton v. Hampton, 11 Moore, P. C. 347-352, &c.; Doyle v. Falconer, 1 L. R. P. C. 328, in which, on page 350, it is distinctly asserted, that â€?a power to punish for contempt is a judicial power.â€?As then, the power which has been exercised over McDonald was judicial, which, as a rule, must be exercised by courts alone, in which that general- power is lodged by the constitution of the state, and as' the senate had no judicial authority over the official whose conduct they were investigating, when the alleged contempt was committed, and as the constitution of the state expressly vests only legislative power in the senate and assembly, it is a most important question to be determined, as personal liberty is involved, when and how, and by virtue of what, did the senate acquire the judicial power, which alone can sentence the citizen to imprisonment in a common jail. It is true that there are statutory enactments in this state (1 Edm. R. S. 153, sec. 13, sub. 4), which undertake to confer upon â€?each house . . . the power to punish as a contempt, and by imprisonment, a breach of its privileges, or of the privileges of its members â€?in certain specified cases, among which are, â€?that of refusing to attend, or be examined as a witness, either before the house or a committee, or before any person authorized by the house, or by a committee, to take testimony in legislative proceedings.â€?It is also true that this enactment can have force by limiting its provisions to those cases, in which by the constitution of the state either house has judicial powers (some of which have been previously mentioned), but it cannot be denied that relying upon the case of Anderson v. Dunn (6 Wheaton, 204), and which they refer to in their notes (3 R. S. [2d ed.] 456), the revisers of our statutes supposed that the power to punish for contempts existed in both branches of the legislature. The authority relied upon, however, which does hold that either house of Congress has, by virtue of its legislative power, general authority to punish for contempt, is distinctly overruled in the more recent case by the same tribunal (the Supreme Court of the United States) in Kilbourn v. Thompson (103 U. S. 168), Of Anderson v. Dunn, Judge Miller, in giving the opinion of the court in the later case, says: â€œIt was decided as a case of the first impression in this court, and undoubtedly under pressure of the strong- rulings of the English courts in favor of the privileges of the two houses of parliament. Such is not the doctrine, however, of the English courts to-day.â€?The learned judge then refers to the English cases (103 U. S.198, 199, 200), and concludes with the distinct repudiation of the extreme view of the power of either house of congress, affirmed in Anderson -u. Dunn. Notwithstanding then the existence of a positive legislative enactment justifying the power exercised in the case of McDonald, and notwithstanding the very eminent source from which it emanatedâ€”the revisers of our statutes who were misled by the opinion of our highest federal tribunal, since overruled by the same supreme authorityâ€”it is still proper to ask, how could the legislature confer upon itself, or upon either branch thereof, judicial power for the purposes of general legislation ? Or to put the question more fully and accurately, it being conceded that the alleged contempt for which McDonald is imprisoned was committed, if at all, not in the course of a judicial inquiry, which the senate, by the constitution was authorized to make, but in the course of a legislative inquiry instituted with a view to possible legislation, how could a mere statute confer upon it the power which it has exercised % We are thus brought (as it is cited to uphold McDonnellâ€™s imprisonment) to the discussion of the constitutionality of a statute of the state, an inquiry, certainly of the gravest character, but one which courts must consider and decide, when arising in the due course of a judicial proceeding.
It cannot be denied that the law-making power of the state is more general, and reaches a class of subjects, upon which the congress of the United States cannot legislate; and as the grant of power to the legislature to legislate is general, it is for those who question the constitutionality of a statute to show that it is forbidden. People v. Draper, 15 N. Y. 532, 543. But while all this is true, it is also true that there are â€?positive restraints upon the legislative power contained in the â€?constitution, and that, as was further well said by Denio, O. J., in the ease just cited (p. 544) in regard to that instrument: â€?Every positive direction contains an implication against anything contrary to it, or which would frustrate or disappoint the purpose of that provision. The frame of the government, the grant of legislative power itself, the organization of the executive authority, the erection of the principal courts of justice create implied limitations upon the law-making authority as strong as though a negative was expressed in each instance.â€?To this must be added the further thought that the jurisdiction of congress to legislate, when exercised over the subject matters confided to its care, is as supreme as that of the lÃ©gislature of the state over those of which it has cognizance, and that, therefore, whatever authority or right, which exists as an incident of or as ancillary to the simple .power of legislation, must be possessed in an equal degree by both, for to each, subject, of course, to certain fundamental1 restraints, has been confided all the authority which the people (of thp several states in the one instance, and of one state in the other) had to legislate upon the subjects committed to each. , The constitution of this state, too, fails to confer upon its legislature, as the constitution of the United States does upon its congress, the express power to punish the citizen, and both declare â€?no person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of-law.â€?These considerations make the case of Kilbourn -y. Thompson, 103 Ã¼. S. 168, applicable to the present one, and the conclusion therein drawn from the distribution of the executive, legislative and judicial functions into different departments controlling, on the point now being considered.
Conceding then that the power which has been exercised by the senate is a judicial one, that it was exercised in the pursuit of an inquiry which was legislative and not judicial in its character, that by the constitution of the state its judicial power is committed to courts which are therein recognized, and to such other courts as the legislature are thereby authorized to establish, and that such deposit of general judicial power elsewhere than in the legislature is a prohibition against the conferring of such power upon itself, it is impossible to see how the provisions of the Revised Statutes, before quoted and upon which action has been issued, can constitutionally confer upon the senate of this state the power which has been assumed. It is not designed by this to assert that the statutes in question are wholly void. They may have full application by limiting them to cases in which either house may act judicially, but upon reason and authority they must be held impotent to confer a general power to commit and punish as a contempt the refusal of an individuÃ¡l to give evidence, when such testimony is required solely for the purpose of legislation.
Hot only, however, is the statute under consideration to be held inoperative in its application to the present case, for the reason that the power exercised thereunder is a judicial one, and cannot be lodged by the legislature elsewhere than where the constitution has placed it, but also because it violates the express provision of that instrument declaring (art. 1, sec. 6): â€œMo person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.â€?In Taylor v. Porter, 4 Hill, 146, 147, Judge Bronson, in speaking of this clause, said : â€?The words Â£ due process of law â€?in this place cannot mean less than a prosecution or suit instituted and conducted according to the prescribed forms and solemnities for ascertaining guilt or determining the title to property.â€?In Kilbourn v. Thompson (103 U. S. 198, 182), the Supreme Court of the United States, per Miller, J., said : â€?Of course, neither branch of congress, when acting separately, can lawfully exercise more power than is conferred by the constitution on the whole body, .except in the few instances where authority is conferred on either house separately, as in the case of impeachments. Mo general power of inflicting punishment by the congress of the United States is found in that instrument. It contains in the provision that no person shall be deprived of bife, liberty or property without due process of law the strongest implication against punishment by order of the legislative body. It has been repeatedly decided by this court and by others of the highest authority, that this means a trial in which the rights of the party shall be decided by a tribunal appointed by law, which tribunal is to be governed by rules of law previously established.â€?In holding that this provision of our state constitution is applicable to the cause under consideration, the force of certain decisions of our Court of Appeals (Happy v. Mosher, 48 N. 7. 313; People v. Supervisors, 70 N. 7. 228), holding that due process of law â€?need not be a legal proceeding according to the course of the common law,â€?has not been overlooked. While the cases referred to were undoubtedly correctly decided, it can hardly be supposed that the most ardent advocate of plenary power in the legislature would attempt to sustain the constitutionality of a statute which directed a committee of either house to inquire.into a controversy between individuals, and upon the report of such committee authorize each house, or the legislature itself, to decide such controversy, Hor would a law authorizing an inquiry by means of a legislative committee as to the commission of crime, and its punishment by the legislature, or either house thereof, upon the report' of its committee, be deemed valid. Such attempted legislation in either ease would be void, not only for the reason that it undertook to transfer judicial power from the courts, where the constitution places it, but also because it violates the provision of the constitution forbidding the deprivation of life, liberty or property without due process.of law. In Happy V. Mosher, before cited, Judge Eabl, while holding that the proceeding which takes property need not be one according to the course of the common law, distinctly says: â€?An approved definition of due process of law is, â€?law in its regular course of administration, through courts of justice? 2 Kent's Com. 13.â€?As McDonald is confessedly deprived of his liberty, not according to â€?law in its regular course of administration through courts of justice,â€?the legality of such imprisonment must be upheld by some other argument than one founded upon the -statute which, as is alleged, confers it. If the power exercised is a judicial one (and that it is, is too clear to be debatable), then the attempt to confer it by law upon the legislature, or either house thereof, in a case over which it has no judicial power, must fail for the reasons given, unless also it is one inherent in a legislative body, as in courts, as the reviewer's seemed to suppose, when they reported these statutory provisions. Is it so inherent, is the next question to be considered.
In the discussion of this question it must be conceded that â– there are not wanting cases,,nor opinions of elementary writers, holding that the power to punish for contempt is one inherent in every legislative body. Cooley on Const. Lim. 134; 1 Kent, 236; 1 Story on the Const. 4th ed. Â§ 847. Such decisions and opinions, however, are founded upon the usage of the English parliament, the case of Burdett v. Abbott, 14 East, 1-131, with the earlier decisions of the English courts, and the' case of Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheaton, 204. In the quite recent case, however, of Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U. S. 168, which follows the later English cases, overruling Burdett v. Abbott and the older decisions, the Supreme Court of the United States, in an exhaustive opinion by Miller, J., has repudiated the conclusions announced in Anderson v. Dunn, and held that â€?an examination of the history of the English parliament and the decisions of English courts, shows that the power of the house of commons, under the laws and customs of parliament to punish for contempt, rests upon principles peculiar to it, and not upon any general rule applicable to all legislative bodies. The parliament of England, before its separation into two bodies, since known as the house of lords and the house of commons, was a high court of judicature, the highest in the realm, possessed .of the general power incident to such a court of punishing for contempt. On its separation, the power remained with each body, because each was considered a court of judicature and exercised the functions.of such a court.â€?It was argued, however, that the question in Kilbourn v. Thompson related to the power of a single house of congress, and that the question of the power of a state legislature was not before the court. This is true, but the point what legislative power is inherent in a legislative body as sicoh, was before the court, and the existence of the power, as a legislative one to punish for contempt, was denied. Keither, as has been before partially argued, is there such a difference between the legislature of a state and congress as to make that decision inapplicable to the present case. Certainly congress is a legislative body as well as a state legislature. If the right to punish for contempt exists by force of the fact that power to legislate is conferred, then it must exist in both. That the field of legislation varies, cannot change the prerogative which follows the simple power to legislate, and therefore the conclusion which the court, in Kilbourn v. Thompson, drew from the fact that the judicial powers of the two houses of the English parliament were not â€?applicable to all legislative bodies,â€?is conclusive against the existence of the power in a state legislature simply, and only because it has law-making power.
The case of Kilbourn v. Thompson, which has been so often referred to in the course of this opinion, is well worthy of a careful study, not only because it is the judgment of the highest court in the land, but also because the learned and exhaustive opinion of Mr. Justice Miller conclusively shows that past precedents of the congress of the United States and of the legislatures of the several states in legislative inquiries are not to be followed. They all undoubtedly had their origin in the practice of the English parliament, which the case of Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheaton, 204, held to be applicable to both houses of congress. The resolution under which the inquiry of the committee of the house of representatives in the Kilbourn case was conducted, recited that the United States was a creditor of the bankrupt firm of Jay Cooke & Co., and became such â€œfrom the improvident deposits made by the secretary of the navy of the United States, with the London branch of said house of Jay Cooke & Co., of the public moneys that the house of Jay Cooke & Co. were largely interested in a real estate pool in the city of Washington, of their interest in which a settlement, disastrous to their estate and to its creditors, had been made by their trustee; and that, therefore, the affairs of such pool and the matters of such settlement should be inquired into by a special committee of the house, to be appointed by its speaker, â€?with power to send for persons and papers and report to this house.â€?Of such a resolution, as it involved an inquiry into .a transaction in which the general government, as well as private individuals, was interested, it might well have been said that under it legislation was contemplated to prevent in the future â€?improvident deposits â€?by an official of the United States with an individual banking house, and to prevent fraudulent settlements thereafter by trustees of the estates of adjudged bankrupts, and that, therefore, the inquiry was within the power of the house; and yet, after Kilbourn had declined to answer questions propounded by the committee touching the pool it was required to investigate, and had refused to produce its records, and for such refusal the house had adjudged him to be in contempt, and had imprisoned him therefor, in an action brought for the imprisonment, the court held that the inquiry was beyond the jurisdiction of the liouse and the imprisonment illegal and contraiâ€™y to law. Can that case be distinguished from the present ? It is, undoubtedly, very similar. The argument founded upon the necessity'of an investigation to formulate legislation is as forcible in the one case as in the other, and if in the one case such argument was not sufficiently potent to justify the imprisonment, it is not seen why it should be in the other. True it is that the decision referred to was directly predicated upon the power of congress, and not upon that of a state legislature, but of the subject-matter of the inquiry the house of representatives had as full and complete jurisdiction in the matter of Kilbourn as the senate of this state had in that of McDonald. In both cases the intent to legislate was evinced, if there was any such intent in either, by the direction to the committee â€?to reportin both the private affairs of the citizen were sought to be discovered; and until now the right of investigation by congress and the state legislature has been placed, both by elementary writers and in judicial opinions, upon a common ground, as an incident to the law-making power. ' The most exalted tribunal of the land having deliberately held that such power as has been assumed by the senate in the present case (which is believed to be the logical sequence from the decision in the Kilbourn case)', it is difficult to see how the imprisonment of McDonald can be sustained either on authority or reason.
If the decision in Kilbourn v. Thompson has not foreclosed discussion of the question under consideration, it may be well to further consider the argument generally pressed to sustain the power of a legislative body to punish as a contempt the refusal of a witness to answer questions in aid. of legislation, founded upon its alleged necessity. The argument, in brief, is this : The power is a necessary one to enable a legislative body to enact laws, and because necessary, though unconferred, it exists. The force of the old maxim, â€?Quando lex aliquid concedit, concederÃ© videtur et illud, sine quo res ipsa esse non potest,â€?is conceded as a general rule; but it would be difficult to prove that such a power is indispensable in the enactment of laws, and that legislators can only intelligently legislate in regard to crime and official delinquencies when they have precise information as to the crimes committed by particular individuals, and the delinquencies of particular officials. The truth in no such exact accuracy of knowledge has ever been acquired, either through investigation by examination of witnesses or without it, and the existence of our state government to-day, and our body of wise and wholesome statutes disprove the theory upon which the argument rests. It is not supposed in the present case that there was any intention impertinently to pry into the private affairs of a citizen, nor is there discoverable in the examination of McDonald any attempt to extort evidence which was not legitimate to the inquiry, provided the inquiry itself was legitimate and authorized by law. If the commissioner of public works of the city of Hew York had committed frauds, or if it was supposed he had, the machinery of the law, controlled by courts, was adequateâ€™to investigation and punishment. If the proper safeguards of integrity of official, conduct in such commissioner were not embodied in the law creating the office, an examination of those statutes would disclose the opportunities for official peculation, and reflection would suggest proper amendment. The truth is, that if the â€?mqy,isitorial power â€?(this is the name given to it by the counsel for the senate) exists in a branch of the state legislature, the citizen can have no secret: all the details of his private business, the condition of his property and estate, any immoral conduct, any short-coming in thought, word or deed can be laid bare under the torture of imprisonment. Of course, good sense and honor will generally prevent such an abuse of power, but t'he statement of the ultimate conclusion is necessary before the concession is made of the existence, in are-publican state, of an unconferred power capable of such results. If such a power is inherent in the legislative department because its existence is necessary, why does it not, also, inherently reside in the executive ? The governor may, when called upon to act officially, and especially when making suggest",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ons as to legislation, oftentimes need exact information. Why should he not enjoy the same prerogative under the plea of necessity ? The answer to the argument in both cases is, that, under republican governments the liberty of the citizen is secure, and the power which interferes with it must be conferred by the fundamental law. Extraordinary parliamentary prerogatives and privileges, by which the secrets of the citizen may be extorted and his liberties taken away, existing in a country where a parliament is supreme, and gives to the people whatever rights they possess, cannot exist in a country, the government of which rests upon a precisely opposite theory, that the people confer all power, and that executives, legislatures and courts take only such authority as the people bestow. It was well said by Bronson, J., in Taylor v. Porter, 4 Hill, 140-144: â€?Under our form of government the legislature is not supreme. It is only one of the organs of that absolute sovereignty which resides in the whole body of the people. Like other departments of the government, it can only exercise such powers as have been delegated to it; and when it steps beyond that boundary, its acts, like those of the most humble magistrate in the state who transcends his jurisdiction, are utterly void.â€?To the argument, then, founded on necessity, the answer is clear. Its possession may be convenient, but is not indispensable; its capacity for abuse is enormous; it deals with the liberty of the citizen upon the theory of existing parliamentary privileges, which have never been conferred, and because unconferred, cannot be exercised under a government republican in form, which, to be such in fact, as well as in name, cannot commit persons within its jurisdiction to an â€?Inquisitorial Power,â€?uncontrolled by law, the only restraint being the discretion of the body exercising it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The argument already made, to show that the power exercised by the senate in the case of McDonald is not one inherent in a legislative body, hardly needs the support of adjudged cases in addition to that of Kilbourn v. Thompson, but the following, with the single exception of one in Canada, by the privy council of England, abundantly sustain it: Kielly v. Carson, 4 Moore's P. C., 63; Fenton v. Hampton, 11 Moore's P. C. 349-366; Doyle v. Falconer, 1 L. R. P. C. 328, and Landers v. Woodworth, 2 Canada Sup. Ct. R. 158. If it is possible to settle a legal problem by weight of judicial character and learning, then this must be deemed settled, for looking at the learning of the judges who have rendered these decisions, especially that of Kielley v. Carson, it is true, as Judge Miller asserts in the Kilbourn case, that because of their weight such decisions â€?should be received as conclusive.â€?It was further argued that, under section 17 of article 1 of our state constitution, this power in question is conferred, because it adopts the common law of England and makes it a part of ours. A reference to that clause of the constitution will show that the whole body of the common law of England was not thereby introduced into this state, but only â€?such parts of the common law, and of the acts of the legislature of the colony of New York, as together did form the law of the colony on the nineteenth day of April, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five . . . shall be and continue the law of this state.â€?The truth is, that the powers of the English parliament were not dependent upon the common law at all (see cases above cited), but upon the lex et consuetudo parliament ; and as early as 1604 the parliament called itself (1 Hallam's Con. His. 254-5) â€œthe high court of parliament,â€?and then added, â€?whose power being above the law is not founded on the common law, but have their rights and privileges peculiar to themselves.â€?It will be observed that the constitution adopts only â€?such parts of the common law, and of the acts of the legislature of the colony of New York, as together, did form the law of the colony â€?on April 19,1775, and no part of th% parliamentary law. It is necessary, therefore, to sustain the position taken by the counsel for the senate, to prove that the power claimed was either part of the common law of the colony, or was contained in an act of its legislature. As it was not a part of the common law of England, it is difficult to see how it could become a part of the common law of the colony; and as no act of the colony ever conferred it, it is equally difficult to see how the constitutional provision referred to aids the position assumed. The ninth article of the first' constitution of the state, adopted in 1777 (7th ed. R. S. 39), did provide â€œthat the assembly . . . shall choose their own speaker, be judges of their own members, and enjoy the same privileges," and proceed in doing business in like manner as the assemblies of the colony of New York formerly did;â€?but """"this clause gave no power to the senate", and was omitted in the subsequent constitutions, and the provision now reads as has been set, forth above. It has already been shown that the constitution, as it now reads, does not give any color to the argument that it validates the power in either branch of the legislature, but it may be well to show that the colonial legislature had no such power in fact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It clearly was never granted. No such bestowal of authority can be found in the charter issued by Charles I. to his brother James, duke of York, in 1664, nor in any act of parliament. It is unnecessary to dfetail the mode and manner of the government of the colony of New York while under English rule. It is sufficient to state that instead of the absolute power of parliament being conferred upon the colonial legislature, or upon the people themselves, its laws were subject to royal approval, and even the charter of liberties, passed on the 17th day of October,1683, by the assembly of the colony, was vetoed.by James (the same duke of York) when he became king in 1686, and the act of 1691 shared the same fate under King William, (Bancroft's History of the United States, vol. 2, p. 414; vol. 3, p. 56 ; Id. p. 101 ; 2 R. L. of 1813, note on page 6 of appendix). â€?Its â€?(parliamentâ€™s) â€?absolute power,â€?Mr. Bancroft says (vol. 3, p. 101), â€œwas in general terms unquestioned in England, even by American agents, and was by itself interpreted to extend over all the colonies with no limitation but its own pleasure. It was â€˜absolute and unaccountable.â€™â€?The same author (page 108) further states: â€?The property, the personal freedom, the industry, the chartered liberties, of the colonies were placed in the good will and under the absolute power of the English legislature.â€?It is unnecessary .to pursue investigation as to the grant of power.- It certainly was never made, and the learned counsel who have argued in favor of the continuance of McDonaldâ€™s imprisonment, have failed to point out when, and by what it was bestowed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Though the records of the past do not disclose the conferring of the authority claimed to have existed in the colonial legislatures, it is, nevertheless, insisted that it was inherited. The practice and dealing of the English crown and parliament with the colony, Already referred to, are as conclusive against the existence of the power by inheritance, as by grant. If, however, it be clearly understood what power parliament had, the impossibility of the succession to such authority, either by the legislature of a colony or that of a republican state, will clearly appear. Blackstone, in his commentaries (vol. 1, pp. 160, 161) says: â€?The power and jurisdiction of parliament, says Sir Edward Coke, is so transcendent and absolute, that it cannot be confined, either for causes or persons, within any bounds. And of this high court, he adds, it may be truly said â€˜si antiquiiatem speetes, est vetustissima â€?si dignitatem, est honoratissima; is firisdictionem, est capacissima? It hath sovereign and uncontrolling authority in the making, confirming, enlarging, restraining, abrogating, repealing, reviving and expounding of laws concerning matters of all possible denominations, ecclesiastical or temporal, civil, military, maritime or criminal; this being the place where that absolute despotic power, which must in all governments reside somewhere, is intrusted by the constitution of these kingdoms. All mischiefs and grievances, operations and remedies, that transcend the ordinary course of the laws, are within the reach of this extraordinary tribunal. It can regulate or new model the succession to the crown, as was done in the reign of Henry VIII. and William III. It can alter the established religion of the land, as was done in a variety of instances, in the reign of King Henry VIII. and his three children. It can change and create afresh even the constitution of the kingdom and of parliaments themselves, as was done by the act of union, and the several statutes for triennial and septennial elections. It can, in short, do everything that is not naturally impossible, and, therefore, some have not scrupled to call its power, by a figure rather too bold, the omnipotence of parliament.â€?The same author (page 163) further observes : â€?For as every court of justice hath laws and customs for its direction, some the civil and canon, some the common law, others their own peculiar laws and customs, so the high court of parliament hath also its own peculiar law, called the lex et oonsuetudo parliament â€?a law which, Sir Edward Coke observes, is â€˜ah omnibus quosrenda, a multis ignÃ³rala, apaueis .cognita.â€?â€?Is it to be gravely argued that such supreme power, such extraordinary prerogatives, passed by inheritance to either a colonial or state legislature, both of which took only conferred, and not inherited authority ? If they did, then freedom found no asylum on American soil, and the founders of states unconsciously brought with them a tyranny, which, like their shadows, followed them across the Atlantic, and descended, like the mantle of the prophet, upon the shoulders of the body they created, in the vain hope that well-defined and circumscribed power, and not omnipotence; had been by them bestowed. If it be urged that, by inheritance, legislatures took only a few of these parliamentary prerogatives, of which their right to summon all citizens before it or its committees, and to extract from their unwilling breasts all secrets by the power of imprisonment, was one, it is answered that heirs, in the absence of a testamentary disposition, take the ancestorâ€™s whole estate, and the argument founded upon an alleged inheritance must be abandoned, because it proves too much. But if a partial inheritance is consistent with the argument based upon an alleged heirship, and it be urged that only such powers as were consistent with the changed order of things were taken, then it is insisted that this particular power, so potent for mischief, and aptly termed â€?inquisitorial,â€?could not descend by inheritance to the legislature of either a colony or a republican state. It is inconsistent with the framework of both, and the conceded fact that both took only conferred power, and not any by inheritance, is a sufficient answer to the suggested argument.,,,,,,,
Abstract reasoning, however, is again made unnecessary by decisions of English courts. In the cases before cited Kielley v. Carson, 4 Moore's P. C. 63; Fenton v. Hampton, 11 Moore's P. C. 367, 366; Doyle v. Falconer, L. R., P. C. 328; also the Canada case, Landers v. Woodworth, 2 Can. Sup. Ct. R. 158, this very point now under consideration was expressly decided, and they hold distinctly that the legislatures of the colonies of England did not take the power of parliament to punish for contempt. They have so decided, after full and exhaustive argument, when presided over by judges, whose names and character are world-wide famous, and such decisions, in every judicial forum, should arrest discussion and dispel doubt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To the suggestion that the constitution of the state adopted the statutes in force when it took effect (art. 1, Â§ 17), and, therefore, validated those which assumed to give power to the legislature to punish for contempt, it is an answer to say, that if unconstitutional they were not â€?in force]' but were void, and were not embraced within the language of the constitution; and to the further suggestion that the power which has been exercised over McDonald is one which has long been resorted to, it is sufficient to say, that the existence of power whenever claimed, can be resisted by questioning its bestowment, and that its use by congress for a term almost equally long did not prevent the judicial declaration in the Kilbourn matter, that his imprisonment was unlawful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is believed that the various grounds upon which the legality of the imprisonment of McDonald was sought to be justified have now been examined, and the result of such examination is the conclusion, that in the light of the recent decisions in England, that in Kilbourn v. Thompson, and of reason, it' cannot be upheld. If McDonald had refused to answer questions in aid of an inquiry in which the senate was authorized to act judicially, then the power to commit would follow; and, to guard against any misapprehension, the general statement should be made, when the legislature or either branch thereof, is in the execution of jxidicial functions conferred by the conistitution, the power to commit for contempt cannot be doubted. When, howevÃ©r, the inquiry is for legislative purposes only, and such it was in the present instance, most careful examination and reflection lead the judge to whom this case has been submitted, to more than doubt the legal existence of the power which has been exercised over McDonald. This, however, is his individual conclusion, supported it is true by the decision in Kilbourn v. Thompson, and those recently made by the privy council in England, but which, though of very high authority, have not yet been adopted in this state. The judicial utterances in cases determined in this state (though in none, with the single exception of People v. Learned, was the direct question involved), are against the conclusions herein stated. The contrary rule was affirmed in Briggs v. Mackellar, 2 Abb. Pr. R. 30, in Wickelhausen v. Willett, 10 Abb. Pr. R. 164; and again in same case sub nom. Wilckens v. Willett, 1 Keyes,521,525, in the Court of Appeals. In the last mentioned case was involved the legality of the arrest of an individual for neglecting to appear before a committee of the house of representatives of the congress of the United States, as a witness, â€?in a matter,â€?as the stipulation under which it was submitted admitted, â€œthen pending and under investigation by said house, and within its jurisdiction? It is not, and could not, therefore, decide that the power to punish for contempt existed, when the refusal to testify was made in the course of an examination in aid of general legislation; but the existence of such a power is stated, both by Judge Hoffman in the Superior Court and Judge Johnson in the Court of Appeals, in the most unqualified language. Such utterances, however, were made long prior to the decision in Kilbourn v. Thompson, and if that had then been promulgated, they perhaps would never have been announced with the breadth which they now cover. Still they are in conformity with the dicta of other judges, scattered through the reports and the opinions of various elementary writers, and, therefore, as the practice of this state has been in conformity with such opinions for many years, should not be disregarded by a single judge in judicial action, even though his views may be widely different from theirs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The need of conservative action in this particular case is enforced not only by the opinions to which reference has been made, but also by one adjudged case, that of the People v. Learned, 5 Hun,626, in this judicial department. A commission had .been created by joint resolution of the legislature (Laws of 1875, 823) â€?to investigate canal affairs,â€?and by an act (chap. 91 of Laws of 1875) it was authorized â€?to compel the attendance of witnesses.â€?One Henry D. Denison had refused to produce before such commission certain books and papers, and for such refusal had been committed to the common jail of Albany county. On habeas corpus Mr. Justice Learned had released him from imprisonment,'which decision was reversed by the General Term of the Supreme Court, Judge James writing the opinion, and Judge Boardman, concurring. It is true that the authority of this case is very much weakened by the fact (vol. 16 of Albany Law Journal, 96) that when the case came before the Court of Appeals for review, the counsel, who had been successful at the General Term, â€?asked the court not to review it, and stipulated not to enforce the determination, either against the person or the property of Denison,â€?and that thereupon the Court of Appeals refused to hear it, but, nevertheless, until reversed it must control this court as now organized. The opinion of Judge James cites no adjudged case, holding that the power which the canal commission exercised was legally-conferred, nor is it sustained by any argument therein stated. The conclusion, however, that the decision of Mr. Justice Learned should be reversed, can only be justified upon the assumption that the legislature could confer judicial power upon the commission it' created, by which alone it could make its inquiry effective. It needs no argument to demonstrate that, if such power could be conferred upon a commission charged with the mere duty of investigation, it could also be conferred upon a committee of either house of the legislature. If that decision is the law of this state, then the imprisonment of McDonald is abundantly justified, and certainly, until reversed, it is the law governing the action, if not the opinion, of every judge within the department where it was made, when sitting alone and holding a court inferior in dignity to that which announced it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is undoubtedly an argument of great force, that since the dicta contained in opinions and text books, to which allusion has been made, were written, the Supreme Court of the United States and the privy council of England have overruled the earlier decisions upon which they rest. This argument has also been carefully weighed, but the judge writing this opinion has been unable to reach the conclusion that it would be a wise exercise of power for him, when singly holding a court, to overturn the entire practice of the state. Judges and courts must be conservative and not rash in action. A decision of a single judge, contrary to the practice of years of his own state, contrary to an adjudged case in the tribunal which is his immediate superior, and contrary to the opinion of the higher branch of the legislature of' such state, in which are many lawyers of eminent ability, would not command respect and would only create alarm as an abuse of power. The effect of the decision in Kilbourn v. Thompson, and those by the privy council in England upon the legislative practice of this state, must be determined by a higher tribunal than the one which now deals with the present case. If its decision shall be in conformity with the views expressed in this opinion, the relator will not be remediless; and if it shall be adverse to such views, then the. conclusion reachedâ€”that Mr. McDonald must be remanded to the custody of the sheriff of Albany county, to be held by him under the senateâ€™s warrant of commitmentâ€”will not interfere with the exercise of a power which the body exercising it claims to possess, and which it supposes it is wielding for the best interests of the state.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In conclusion, a word should be added upon a point made in behalf of McDonald, to the effect that the Penal Code has taken from the legislature all power to punish for contempt. The argument is that, by section 69 of such Code, if he unlawfully refused â€?to answer any material and proper questions â€?asked by the senateâ€™s committee, he could be indietÃ©d for a misdemeanor, and as his offense was thus punishable according to the provisions of such Code it was to be punished thereunder â€?and not otherwise.â€? Â§ 719. This is specious, but not sound. The Penal Code prescribes and relates to the â€œpunishments â€?to â€?be inflicted only upon a legal conviction in a court having jurisdiction,â€?Â§ 9; and the Code of Criminal Procedure prescribes â€?the manner of prosecuting and convicting criminals.â€?Â§ 8. The object of section 719 was to declare when the old penalties attached to crime, on conviction after a prosecution in and before a competent court, and when the new were applicable. After declaring that the provisions of the Code should have no retroactive effect, it explicitly states that â€?an offense committed or other act done, at any time before the day when this Code takes effect . . . must be punished according to . . . the provisions of law existing when it was done or committedwhile one â€?committed after the beginning of the day when this Code takes effect, must be punished according to the provisions of this Code, and not otherwise.â€?A general statute, as a rule, does not repeal a special one, and therefore a general code of laws relating to the penalties which courts must impose on convictions for crime according to the usual mode of procedure do not repeal special provisions to punish summarily for contempt. The words â€?not otherwise â€?in such section simply forbid courts, in punishing criminals for offenses to which the penalties of the Code are applicable, to do so â€?otherwise â€?than as such Code provides. It is unnecessary to pursue this point further. A comparison of the various sections with each other, and the language of the whole of section 719, and not of a single paragraph read alone, make the meaning clear. If all power of the legislature to punish summarily for contempt is repealed, then all, which courts had, has also vanished; and if the latter had been swept away, as there was no punishment by the court summarily for contempt, it was useless to declare, as has been by section 680, that an act â€?punishable as a contempt of court â€?was also â€?punishable as a crime.â€?This recognizes that the provisions as to court contempts are not repealed by the Penal Code ; and if those are not, then legislative con-tempts are not, for both are punishable under such Code as misdemeanors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It remains only to be said that to a higher court than the present, the very grave questions involved in the present proceeding are committed, in the hope, however, that the views expressed in this opinion will, even though not adopted, aid in arriving at a sound and judicious conclusion thereon. If the labor and thought which have been given to the subject shall, in any way, assist the tribunal of review, he, who has given to it much of both," will be fully compensated.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1167717,PEOPLE v. COLE,1883-10,"Tappan, J.
The defendant, George P. Cole, was indicted at this court for the crime of murder in the first degree for feloniously killing one Samuel Peters Murray.
Upon his arraignment; he interposed a demurrer to the indictment upon the grounds,
First. That more than one crime is charged in the indictment, within the meaning of sections 278 and 279 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Second. That the facts stated do not constitute a crime, as provided by subdivisions 3 and 4 of section 323 of such Code. â€?The first eleven counts of the indictment charge the crime of murder in the first degree at common law and under the Penal Code, section 183.
The twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth counts severally charge the commission of the crime of assault in the second degree, and then aver that the accused, while engaged in the commission of that felony, did willfully and feloniously kill and murder the said Samuel PÃ©ters Murray.
In every count the crime is alleged to have been committed by the accused at Johnstown, in the county of Fulton, in the state of New York, on the 18th day of July, 1883.
The first, second, third, fourth, fifth, eighth and ninth counts allege the killing to ' have been effected with a certain stone. The twelfth and fourteenth counts allege such killing to have been effected with a certain stone, being â€?then and there an instrument likely to produce grievous harm. In the last named, count the words are â€?grievous bodily harm.â€?The sixth, tenth, eleventh and fifteenth counts allege the killing to have been effected with a certain blunt instrument, to the grand jury unknown, and in the thirteenth and fifteenth counts respectively, the allegation is, â€?being then and there an instrument and thing likely to produce grievous bodily harm.â€?The seventh count alleges the killing to have been effected with a certain piece of brick.
The allegations of the different counts vary in respect to the manner of effecting the killing and the part of the body upon which the wounds from, which death resulted were inflicted, and the extent of such wounds.
Upon the argument, the counsel for the defendant claimed that it appears upon the face of the indictment, that more than one crime is charged therein. If this is so, the defendant must have judgment upon the demurrer. Code Crim. Pro. Â§ 323, subd. 3; Mayo v. State, 30 Ala. 32.
Section 278 of this Code provides that â€?the indictment must charge but one crime, except as in the next section provided.â€?And the next section provides that â€?the crime may be charged in separate counts to have been committed in a different manner or by different means, and when the acts complained of may constitute different crimes, such crimes may be charged in separate counts.â€?Before the enactment of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it was the law that there might be a joinder of various counts in the same indictment stating the same offense distinctly and separately in various ways so as to meet the evidence, and the court would not put the prosecutor to an election. Nelson v. People, 5 Park. Cr. 39; S. C., 23 N. Y. 293; Lanergan v. People, 6 Park. Cr. 209; S. C., 50 Barb. 266.
In People v. Infield, decided in the General Sessions of the City of New York, in December 1882, reported in 1 N. Y. Crim. Reps. 146, Recorder Smyth put the same construction upon these sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
In that case, the indictment contained two counts, the first charging the defendant with grand larceny, and the second charging him with having received the property alleged in the first count to have been stolen, knowing at the time it was so received, that it was stolen; and it was held on demurrer interposed by the defendant, that such sections construed together permit such an indictment..
The opinion of the Recorder holds that two or more separate and distinct felonies may be alleged in different counts in the same indictment, provided they arise out of one and the same transaction, the different counts being allowed only for the purpose of describing the transaction in varying ways to meet the possible evidence in the case.
That this is the correct construction of these sections is evidenced by the amendment to section 279, made by chapter 306 of the Laws of 1883, by inserting the words â€?in a different manner â€?after the word â€œcommitted.â€?The first count of the' indictment alleges that â€?the grand jury of the county of Fulton, by this indictment, accuse George P. Cole of the crime of murder in the first degree, committed as follows;â€?and each of the other counts allege that â€?the said grand jury do further accuse the said George P. Cole of the said crime, committed as followssuch allegations in the respective counts being followed by allegations of the time, place, manner and means of the commission of the crime.
The indictment shows upon its face that the different counts relate to-but one and the same transaction.
The charge is for one crime only, viz.: murder in the first degree, alleged in the several counts to have been committed in a different manner and by different means.
In Taylor v. People, 12 Hun, 212, 216, the rule of construction where an indictment charges several distinct felonies, is stated as follows: â€?Each count in the indictment theoretically describes a different offense, but when it is apparent from the general tenor of the indictment, that each count relates to the same transaction, and that the introduction of separate counts is not for the purpose of proving distinct offenses, but only for the purpose of meeting possible variances or defects of the evidence to establish some one of the ingredients of the felony,,as described in a particular count, then the court can properly exercise a discretion to prevent a failure of justice and treat the indictment as it is, in fact, an indictment for one offense described in different ways.â€?2 Colby's Criminal Law, 121; People v. Austin, 1 Parker, 154.
Second. Ho point was made upon the argument, but that the first eleven counts of the indictment sufficiently charge murder in the first degree, as defined by section 183 of the Penal Code, and at common law, but it was strenuously urged that the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth counts did not charge murder in the first degree, and were not good counts to charge assault in the second degree. Section 183 of the Penal Code provides, that the killing of a human being, unless it is excusable or justifiable homicide, is murder in the first degree when committed without a design to effect death, by a person engaged in the commission of or in any attempt to commit a felony either upon or affecting the person killed or otherwise. Section 218 of such last mentioned Code, provides that a person who willfully and wrongfully wounds or inflicts grievous bodily harm upon another, either with or without a weapon, or willfully and wrongfully assaults another by the use of a weapon or other instrument or thing likely to produce bodily harm, under circumstances not amounting to the crime specified in the last previous section, shall be guilty of assault in the second degree. Section 221 provides that assault in the second degree is punishable by imprisonment in a penitentiary or state prison for not less than two nor more than five years. Section 5 defines a felony to be a crime which is or may be punishable by either death or imprisonment in a state prison. Assault in the second degree is thus made a felony.
The four last mentioned counts in the indictment charge that while the defendant was engaged in committing such an assault upon Murray he was killed.
In charging murder to have been committed, while the accused was engaged in the commission of a felony, the indict-, ment must describe the felony and state substantially facts showing that the accused was engaged in the commission thereof, when he committed the murder charged. Dolan v. People, 64 N. Y. 485, 496.
The defendantâ€™s counsel insists that a felonious assault, resulting in death, is merged in the higher offense that the words â€?without a design to effect death by a person engaged in the commission of or in an attempt to commit a felony either upon or affecting the person killed or otherwise,â€?do not include cases in which the killing resulted from intentional violence to the person killed, and where although the intent was to commit a felonious assault, there was no intention to kill; or in other words, where the felony intended, although not the felony of homicide, was the very act of personal violence which caused the death.
The proposition was discussed in Buel v. People, 18 Hun, 487; S. C., on appeal, 78 N. Y. 492; and in Cox v. People, 19 Hun, 430; S. C., on appeal, 80 N. Y. 500; but its decision was not necessary to the decision of these cases, and the point, as far as I have been able to ascertain, had not been decided when the Penal Code was enacted.
The language of chapter 333 of the Session Laws of 1876, which made killing, when perpetrated by a person engaged in the commission of any felony, murder in the first degree, as compared with section 183 of the Penal Code, passed after discussion, but before decision of this question, indicates to my mind, that the legislature intended to remove any doubt as to the construction of the statute in such a casÃ©, and to make killing effected by a party engaged in the commission of a felony upon the person killed, murder in the first degree, notwithstanding that the act which produced death was without any intent to kill. It was urged upon the argument that if a literal construction is given to section 183, no force or effect can be given to the subsequent sections defining manslaughter. An examination of these sections will show that there is no force in the argument.
Section 188 provides, that â€œin a case other than one of those specified in sections 183, 184,â€?which are the sections defining murder in the first and' second degrees, homicide, not being justifiable or excusable, is manslaughter ; and the next section provides, that such homicide is manslaughter in the first degree when committed without a design to effect death, either by a person committing or attempting to commit a misdemeanor affectiqg the person or property either of the- person killed or of another, or in the heat of passion, but in a cruel or unusual manner, or by means of a dangerous weapon.
By this examination it will be seen, that the acts which constitute manslaughter, are, by the sections defining that crime, other homicides than those mentioned m the previous sections defining murder. Beflection will also convince one that manslaughter may he committed by acts of a person who at the time had no intent to wound or inflict grievous bodily harm.
Willfully and wrongfully wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm upon another, either with or without a weapon, and willfully wounding or assaulting another by the use of a weapon, or other instrument or thing likely to produce grievous bodily harm, even where there is no intent to kill, are offenses from which death is likely to result.
The punishment of the party guilty of such acts from which death results with the same severity awarded to killing with intent to produce death, was intended to restrain such acts and protect life.
The language of the statute is plain and unambiguous. It ought to receive the construction that such language fairly imports in furtherance of legislative intent.
I am, therefore, of opinion that the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth counts of the indictment, properly and sufficiently charge murder in the first degree.
The demurrer is therefore disallowed, with liberty to the defendant to. plead to the indictment, and in the event of his failing to do so, a plea of not guilty must be entered, as provided by section 330 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1167703,PEOPLE v. PERSONS,1884-01,"Hardin, J.
After Gertie Adams had detailed the acts and doings of the defendant, which were alleged as the evidence of the crime, she was asked by the people: â€?What did your grandmother say when you went home?â€?This was objected to, and an exception taken to the ruling allowing the question. The answer was: â€?She asked me what I had done when I went there ;â€?I told her. â€?She asked me how long it had been going on.â€?I told her. . . . â€?I canâ€™t tell all she said.â€?Then the witness was asked, viz.: â€?Has she let you go there since ?â€?This was objected to and overruled, and an exception taken. The answer was, â€?She has not.â€?1. The first question quoted called -for a conversation held in the absence of the defendant, and was inadmissible. It was immaterial what the grandmother said to the witness, after occurrences had taken place, which were complained of. The child had Hot been injured by any violence, had suffered no bodily harm, of which she was complaining, at the time of the conversation, and in no sense was the conversation between her and her grandmother a part of the res gestÅ“. It being incompetent evidence, should not have been received.
2. The question as to whether the girl Gertie had been restrained from visiting the house of Persons after the occurrences of May 18, called for an immaterial fact. What had been the action of the grandmother in that regard did not tend to establish any of the ingredients of the alleged crime. It must have been introduced with -the view of giving the court to understand what was the judgment of the grandmother in respect to the matters which she had learned by conversation with the girl Gertie. The grandmother had no personal knowledge of the crime; her conclusion and action upon the matters, as she had heard them told, was immaterial, yet her action in restraining the girl may have had some influence with the court in dealing with the evidence, and considering whether a conviction of the defendant should be had.
Again. The evidence tended very strongly to establish that all that was done by defendant was with the assent of the girl. There is no pretense that there was any rape, attempt at rape or illicit intercourse.
The improprieties alleged and shown by the evidence came short of making out any such case. Considering the evidence of Gertie and the declarations of defendant, and the conversations of his proved by the peopleâ€™s witnesses and by defendantâ€™s witnesses, as well as his testimony, it is more than probable that the girl assented to all that occurred. The cases cited by Porter, J., in his opinion in People v. Bransby, 32 N. Y. 534, and what was said by the court in that case, as well as the opinion of the court in People v. Special Sessions, 18 Hun, 330, indicate that the assent of- .the child, though of such tender years, may be established as a defense to a charge of indecent assault. In the errors pointed out, there should be a reversal.
Conviction and judgment reversed, and a new trial granted.

1167699,PEOPLE v. DEMPSEY,1884-01,"Boardman, J.
The facts and orders in this case are the same as in The People v. Fitzpatrick, decided at the last September general term. In the latter case we considered the merits and decided, that the order setting aside and discharging the grand jury as to that defendant, and.as to him quashing the indictment found, was erroneous. Such order was therefore reversed.
â–?Upon that occasion, counsel on either side desired the court to pass upon the merits, and no question was raised as to the validity of the appeal taken by the people from such error. That question was not therefore passed upon.
This'appeal by the people arises upon the same state of facts, but the defendants now move to dismiss it upon the ground that the people have no right of appeal in the present instance, and hence the court can acquire no jurisdiction.
Formerly the people had no power to review an adverse decision. People v. Corning, 2 N. Y. 9; People v. Comstock, 8 Wend. 549. Afterwards in 1852 (Laws of 1852, ch. 82), an act was passed giving the people the right to review judgment, in favor of any defendant, except in case of acquittal by a jury. In 1879 and 1880 such right of review was further extended in favor of the people. But a writ of error at common law would not lie on behalf of the people after a judgment of acquittal. People v. Corning, supra; People v. Bork, 78 N. Y. 346. Nor from an order quashing an indictment. People v. Stone, 9 Wend. 191.
But all these provisions have been abolished by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Â§ 15), and now the only mode of reviewing a judgment or order in a criminal action is hy appeal. No such mode of review ever existed before, and so we must look to the Criminal Code for all authority or limitation of authority. Unless the Code gives to the people this right .of appeal, the appeal must be dismissed. By section 518 the people may appeal to the Supreme Court in two cases: 1st. From a judgment for defendant on demurrer to indictment,; 2d. From an order arresting judgment; neither of which cover the present case. In no other case has the right of the people to appeal to the Supreme Court been given. The district attorney concedes that the right is not given by the Code of Criminal Procedure. The concession is fatal. This court may correct errors and mistakes only when they can be brought before us pursuant to law. The court below, through ignorance or corruption, may rule against the people on questions of evidence throughout a trial for murder, whereby a criminal is acquitted, but this court can-mot correct such errors. So, too, of the drawing of a panel of jurors in a criminal case; however gross the error, and however fatal to justice the consequences may be, the action cannot be reviewed on behalf of the people. There is no precedent for an allowance of an appeal in criminal cases outside and independent of the statute. We are not prepared to make one in this case.
Happily, we cannot believe any danger can arise from a willful disregard of the criminal laws, or a corrupt purpose to thwart their due execution by judicial officers. The order in the case under consideration was made at the same time with the one in Fitzpatrickâ€™s case. Hence our decision in that case could not have been known to the learned judge or aided in iriodifying his action in the present instance. Ã‘or can we1 believe that any judge, after the decision of the Fitzpatrick case, would, on the same facts, disregard that decision, even though that appeal was unauthorized by law. The question may be very easily determined by the court of last resort, as in the Petrea case (92 N. Y. 128), by deciding such motions in accordance with our former opinion, and leaving the defendant to test the correctness of the same.
For the reasons stated we think this appeal must he dismissed.

1167694,PEOPLE v. GRAVES,1884-01,"Hardin, J.
Upon this appeal we are called upon to inquire whether the Court of Sessions of Onondaga county, at the time the sentence was pronounced upon the defendant, had lost jurisdiction of the case or the- prisoner, so that it could not legally pronounce sentence, and order judgment. The prisoner had pleaded guilty to the indictment, his plea had been regularly entered, and no sentence had been given by the court upon such conviction. Ho conditional or qualified sentence had been given, and the defendant at all times after his plea, remained liable to the further action of the court. Power remained in the Court of Sessions to give sentence. It had in no manner deprived itself of such power or jurisdiction of .the subject matter or person of the accused. Such power to pronounce sentence was properly exercised, and the judgment entered thereon is regular and binding upon the accused. It does not lie in his mouth to say that he deserved and ought to have received sentence earlier, as he did not demand it, and no injury by the delay to him is shown or inferable from the record now before ns.
We regard the essential question involved in this case.so firmly resolved against the appellant by the authorities, that we do not deem it useful to open the same for fresh investigation and adjudication. Commonwealth v. Dowdicanâ€™s Bail, Thatcherâ€™s Criminal Cases, 269; 115 Mass. 136; People v. Mueller, Cook Co. opinion of Barnum, J., reported in Criminal Law Mag.

1167678,PEOPLE v. MEYERS,1884-02,"Andrews, J.
The question in this case turns upon the construction of section 4 of chapter 549 of the Laws of 1873 entitled â€?An act to amend an act, entitled â€?An act regulating the sale of intoxicating liquorsâ€?passed April 11th, 1870, and the act entitled, â€˜An act to suppress intemperance, and to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors â€?passed April 16th, 1857.â€?That section is as follows: â€?Any conviction for the violation of any provision of this act, or of the act hereby amended, by any person or persons licensed, or at any place licensed as herein provided, shall forfeit, and annul such license. The board of excise of any city, town or village may at any time and upon the complaint of any resident of said city, town or village shall summon before them any person or persons licensed as aforesaid, and if they shall become satisfied that any such person or persons has or have violated any of the provisions of this act or of the acts hereby amended they shall revoke cancel, and annul the license of such person or persons which they are hereby empowered to do, and when necessary to enter upon the premises, and take possession of and cancel such license. Upon an inquiry the said board or the party complained of may summon, and the said board may compel the attendance of witnesses before them and examine them under oath.
The sale of intoxicating liquors by any inn, tavern or hotel keeper or other person on Sunday is made by the act a misdemeanor (Â§ 5).
The conviction of the defendantsâ€?bar-keeper for the sale of liquor on Sunday was therefore a conviction for an offense under the act.
We think the conviction operated ipso facto to annul the defendantsâ€?license.
The first clause of section 4 is awkwardly drawn, but in view of the whole act its meaning is plain.
The license authorized by the second section is a license to one or more designated persons to sell intoxicating liquors, etc., at a specified place within the city, town or village within which the license is granted.
It was competent for the Legislature, in its discretion, to annex any conditions to the granting of licenses which it deemed proper and to prescribe causes of forfeiture. Board of Excise v. Barrie, 34 N. Y. 657.
It is plain that a conviction of a licensee of an offense under the act, works a forfeiture of his license. The act so declares; the words are â€?such conviction shall forfeit and annul such license.â€?In addition, the same result is made to follow any conviction for a violation of the act at the place licensed. The act casts upon the licensee the necessity in order to protect himself in the enjoyment of the license of seeing to it that no violation shall be committed on the licensed premises.
It is not left open to the licensee to claim in case of the conviction of another for such violation, that it was committed without his knowledge or consent. The words â€?or at the place licensed,â€?were obviously inserted to meet this precise ease. Any other construction would make the words meaningless. The subsequent clause of the section provides for the annulment of the license by the Board of Excise upon proceedings instituted upon its own motion or upon complaint of a resident. This jurisdiction does not depend upon the facts of a prior conviction under the act. It is an independent remedy for the annulment of the license by the Board of Excise whenever it becomes satisfied upon inquiry, after notice that the licensee has violated the act. It supplements the provision in the prior clause and operates as an additional restraint and gives a remedy for the revocation of a license although no criminal prosecution has been instituted. It is not necessary to consider sections 25 and 26 of the Act of 1857. These sections provide for the revocation of a license after a conviction or judgment has been obtained against a licensee for a penalty given by the act or upon his bond. The word conviction in these sections is inaccurately used. But the power of revocation given, is by the context plainly limited and exists only where there has been a recovery in a civil proceeding in one of the cases specified and does not extend to a case of a conviction upon indictment. This question was considered in People v. Tighe (5 Hun, 25).
The opinion of Gilbert, J., in that case contains a satisfactory exposition of the statute in question.
The judgment should be affirmed.

1167681,PEOPLE v. HALL,1883-10,"Smith, P. J.
An execution upon a justiceâ€™s judgment against Charles Hall having been issued to one Ayers, a constable, that officer levied upon a quantity of beans in the barn of the plaintiff in error, the father of Charles Hall, which the constable had been informed and believed, were the property of the debtor, who lived with his father on the premises. As the constable was about to remove the beans from the barn, the plaintiff in error told him the beans were his, and did not belong to Charles, and he bade the constable not to levy on them or remove them from the premises. The constable said he would remove them, and he attempted to do so, when the plaintiff in error put his hands upon the officer and excluded him from the barn, using only so much force as was necessary to prevent him from removing the beans. Evidence tending strongly to establish the exclusive ownership and possession of the beans by the plaintiff in error, and that the execution debtor had Ã±o interest in them, was given upon the trial, and the jury would have been justified in so finding. The counsel for the plaintiff in error requested the court to charge the jury that if they should find that the beans levied on were the property of Ransom Hall exclusively, and that the constable was about to remove them from Ransom Hallâ€™s premises and beyond his control, and that Ransom Hall in resisting such removal used no other means or force than was necessary to prevent such removal, he was justified, and the jury should acquit him. The court refused such request, and the counsel for the plaintiff in error excepted.
The court charged the jury, that if they should find that the constable acted in good faith in making the levy upon the beans, believing them to be the property of the execution debtor, and if they should also find that the beans were the property of Ransom Hall, and that Charles Hall had no interest in them, yet the prisoner was not justified in resisting the officer in his attempt to remove the beans, although such resistance was accompanied with no more force than was necessary to prevent such removal, and that they must convict the prisoner. To which the plaintiff in error excepted.
The prisoner was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of twenty-five dollars, and to be imprisoned until satisfied, not exceeding twenty-five days.
The exceptions above stated present the only question in the case. The question is whether the owner of personal property is liable to an indictment for using force to prevent an officer from levying upon such property by virtue of an execution against another person where the officer acts, not wantonly, carelessly, or oppressively, but in good faith, believing the property to be that of the execution debtor.
We have not been able to find an adjudication upon the precise question in this State. It is well settled that the officer is liable as a wrong doer in a ciyil action for making such levy (Finda v. Van Horne, 16 Wend. 631), and it has been held that there is a distinction in. that respect between a levy under an execution, and a taking of goods pursuant to a writ of replevin; the officer being directed in the latter case to take the particular goods described. Foster v. Pettibone, 20 Barb. 350. It was held in the case of People v. Cooper, 13 Wend. 319, that an indictment lies against a party who in the exercise of the right of recaption to repossess himself of goods taken from him, under an attachment against another person, commits a breach of the peace by assaulting the officer who took the goods, if the. process under which the seizure was made, is regular upon its face, although the magistrate who issued it had not jurisdiction of the subject matter. Possibly that case is-distinguishable from this by the circumstance that the officer, when he was assaulted, had the manual possession of the property, when the defendant attempted to regain it. While here, the beans, although a formal levy had been made on them, had not been removed, and were yet in the possession and control of the owner.
The question before us has been passed upon in some of the sister States, but the decisions are conflicting. In Commonwealth v. Kennard, 8 Pick. 133, it was held, that if an officer would take goods belonging to A., and in A.â€™s possession, upon a writ against B., A. may maintain his possession by force in the same manner as he might against any person who is not an officer. But in State v. Downer, 8 Vt. 424, that doctrine was controverted and its opposite asserted by the Supreme Court of Vermont in a well-reasonÃ©d opinion written by Mr. Justice Bedeield. â€œIf,â€?says the learned judge, â€?the owner of property may resist an officer in its defense, so may one who believes himself the owner, for it will not do to predicate crime upon so subtle a distinction as an abstract right of property. â€?lie distinguishes the case from that of an illegal arrest of one person, upon process against another, in which he admits that the officer attempting to make arrest may lawfully be resisted, and says â€?the case of property is very different, and depends upon criteria which are not the objects of sense.â€?He also adverts to the' consideration, that it is the duty of the officer to attach property whenever required to do so, as creating a distinction between his act and the gratuitous trespass of a stranger, without pretence of process.
Under our statute, the proceeding which the officer is authorized to institute, in his discretion, to try the title, to the property, in case of an adverse claim can only be resorted to, after levy made (Code Civ. Proc. Â§ 1418), and it is essential to the protection of the officer that he should have the actual possession and"" control of the property, after his levy, until the adverse claim is disposed of. Besides, the remedy above referred to, is available only to officers levying by - virtue of process issued out of courts of record, and does not apply to a constable levying under an execution upon a justiceâ€™s judgment.
The doctrine of State v. Downer, was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of Vermont in State v. Miller, 12 Vt. 437; Merritt v. Miller, 13 Vt. 416; and State v. Buchannan, 17 Vt. 573. It has been approved and followed by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire State v. Fifield, 18 _N. H. 34; State v. Richardson, 38 N. H. 208 ; and the Supreme Court of Ohio, Faris v. State, 3 Ohio St. 159 ; see also Cokeley v. State, 4 Clark (Iowa) 477. We are referred by the counsel for the plaintiff in error to the case of State v. Johnson, 12. Alabama, .840, in which the Massachusetts case above cited was followed. But it does not appear that the cases in conflict therewith were brought to the attention of the court. We are referred by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, to' an English case cited in Whartonâ€™s Am. Or. Law, 3 Ed. p. 554, but we have not had access to'it. The case of the People v. Wentworth, 4 Scam. 550 is also cited. The opinions above referred to seem to have exhausted the subject, and it is only necessary for us to say that we concur in the reasoning and conclusion of State v. Downer, and 'the other con7 curring cases above cited. The conviction and judgment should be affirmed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1167684,PEOPLE ex rel. McDONALD v. KEELER,1884-05,"Learned, P. J.
An idea has undoubtedly prevailed, and has had some judicial sanction, that congress and the legislatures of the states succeeded to all, or nearly all, those powers which were known under the general name of privileges ofâ€?Parliament, and which are stated in general language by Blackstone. (1 Bl. Comm. 163, et seq.) It was in accordance with this idea that, in 1870, the Assembly of this state summoned before itself a justice of the Supreme Court to answer for a judicial act done by him while sitting as one of the judges of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. Fortunately the Assembly, in the end, contented itself with a1 harmless vote, to the effect that the justice had, without bad intention, committed a breach of privilege. In Matter of Platt Potter (Potter's Dwarris on Stat. 573), it is known that the power of the Assembly would have been contested if any attempt had been made to punish the justice.
This idea of inherited privileges, and especially of inherited power to punish as for contempt, is set forth very fully in Wichelhausen v. Willett, 10 Abb. Pr. 168. It is made, also, a part of the argument for the respondent in this case (by counsel representing the Senate) where he insists that the Legislature has succeeded to the whole of the Parliamentary law of England so far as it is not withheld by or repugnant to the Constitution, including the power to punish for contempt. It is urged by the counsel for the respondent, that this power existed in the colonial legislatures, and has thus come down from them to the legislature of the States. And the counsel cites instances of the exercise of this power by the Colonial Council and Assembly. It may therefore be worth while to examine this claim of power.
In the case of Doyle v. Falconer, Law Rep. 1 Priv. Council, 328, the matter was examined. It was shown that the legislative assembly of an English colony does not possess the power of punishing a contempt, though committed in its presence, and by one of its members ; that such authority does not belong to a colonial house of assembly by analogy to the lex et consuetudo parliament which is inherent in the two houses of parliament or to a court of justice which is a court of record. This same doctrine had been previously held in Kielley v. Carson, 4 Moore P. C. Cases, 62, and in Fenton v. Hampton, 11 Moore P. C. Cases, 347. These cases overruled that of Beaumont v. Barrett, 1 Moore P. C. Cases, 59, in which it had been held (as it seems to be here claimed by the respondentâ€™s counsel) that the power of punishing for contempts was' inherent in every assembly that possesses a supreme legislative power. It is shown in these cases, and the doctrine is again confirmed in Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U. S. 168, that, so far as this power of punishing for contempt belonged to the House of Commons, it existed, not because that was a representative body with legislative functions, but because it was a part of the high court of parliament, a judicial body, the highest court of the realm, which had always possessed this power by ancient usage.
This view is again stated in Speaker v. Glass, Law Reports, 3 Privy Council Cases, 560. In that case Parliament .had expressly given to a Colonial Legislature the right to define its privileges, provided they did not exceed those of the House of Commons; The Colonial Legislature, under that authority, had defined its privileges, etc., to be the same with those of the House of Commons. It was held therefore, that, by this act of Parliament, there had been given to that Colonial Legislature the same power of punishing for contempt as is possessed by the the House of Commons. Thus the case recognizes the law that, unless by the express enactment of Parliament, a Colonial Legislature had no power of punishing for contempt. That question should be deemed settled.
Then the inquiry is presented: Did Parliament, or the English government, ever grant to the colonial legislature of Hew York the privileges of Parliament, or this one of those privileges now under consideration ? We cannot do better than, to quote from the very able and learned opinion of Mr. JusticeWestbrook in this case, upon this point: â€œHo such bestowal; of authority can be found in the charter issued by Charles I. to his brother James, Duke of York, in 1669, nor in any act of Parliament. It is unnecessary to detail the mode and manner, of the government of Hew York, while under English rule.. It is enough to state that, instead of the absolute power of Parliament- being conferred upon"" the colonial legislature, or upon the people themselves, its laws were made subject to royal approval ; and even the Charter of Liberties, passed on the 17th day of October, 1683, by the Assembly, was vetoÃ©d by James (the same Duke of York) when he became King in 1686, and the act of 1691 shared the same fate. 2 Baneroft's Hist. U. S. 412 ; 3 Id. 56, 101; 2 R. L. 1813, note on page 6 of appendix. See also introduction to New York Civil List, 1883, page 69, &c.
In that Charter of Liberties, the only power claimed in this respect is that the representatives shall be the judges of the qualifications of their own members, and may purge their house as they see occasion.
But without going over the history of colonial authority, it if enough to say that the counsel for the respondent has cited us to no grant from the English Parliament or from the Crown, which conferred upon the colonial legislature the privileges of Parliament, and unless these privileges were expressly given, the power to legislate, as has been shown, carried with it no power to punish for contempt. We are brought to the belief that the exercise of that power, though submitted to by the sufferers, and even though supported by colonial courts, was in violation of the law of England as above set forth. Some of the instances cited by counsel would be plainly illegal at this day.
It is, however, urged by the counsel for the respondent that the thirty-fifth section of the first Constitution of the State, that of 1778, declared that such parts of the common law as formed the law of the colony should continue ; and the counsel urges that this privilege of Parliament was a part of the common law, and hence that it was continued in force. ' Now it is at least doubtful whether the phrase, common law, there used, included the privileges of Parliament. The fundamental idea of common law is that it was common to all the subjects of the realm, while privileges of Parliament, though well established, were exceptional rights. But however this may be, we have seen, from the cases cited, that the doctrine of the common law (if it be properly so called) was not that every legislative body possessed the power of punishing for contempt, in case of refusal to answer questions, but that such power belonged to courts; and that it had come to the houses of Parliament as parts of the high courts of the realm. If therefore the Constitution of 1778 continued the law on this point as part of the common law, it gave thereby no authority to punish for such contempts to the Assembly or -Senate, to which bodies was given simply legislative power '(section 2, Constitution 1778); for the Legislature of the State was not Parliament, and was not a court.
There is another section of that Constitution, the ninth, which declares that the Assembly (not the Senate) shall enjoy the same privileges as the assemblies of the eolony of New York of right formerly did. We have already-seen, by the decisions of the English courts, that the Colonial Assemblies could not have enjoyed of right the privileges of â€˜committing for contempt in refusing to answer, unless that privilege had been granted expressly by the English government, and that no such grant is shown.
The Constitution of 1821 omits any such clause, and merely provides that each house shall be the judge of the qualifications of its own members. The same is true of the Constitution of 1846. Thus the somewhat indefinite grant of power, by reference to the powers of the assemblies of the colony, is taken away. The comment of the revisers of the statutes Edmondsâ€?Ed. vol. 5, p. 517) is of no weight, inasmuch as they were not the authors of the Constitution of 1821, and as they base their opinion upon Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 598, which has been overruled by Kilbourn v. Thompson, ut supra. Hence we may conclude that the right of the Senate â€?to punish a citizen for contempt of its authority, or a breach of its privileges, can derive no support from the precedents and practices of the two houses of the English Parliament, nor from the adjudged cases in which the English courts have upheld these privileges.â€?Kilbourn v. Thompson, ut supra. Although that decision was made in a case arising upon a commitment by the House of Â¡Representatives, still the argument and the language are appropriate to the present case. The fact that the Federal Government is one of limited extent does not, in any way, affect the argument as to the powers of its legislative bodies, in respect to the matters which belong to Federal control. All legislative power on matters within the authority of the Federal Government is given to Congress, just as in this State, the legislative power is given to the Senate and Assembly. Whether that gift of power carries with it the privileges of the English Parliament, is practically the same question in each case, when it is shown that those privileges belonged to Parliament as a court, and not therefore to every legislative body.
Another point is to be noticed. The question before us does not touch, in any way, the power of the Senate, or Assembly, to keep order in its own rooms, to judge of the qualifications of its members, and to expel them from improper conduct. To say that they may do this is but to say that they have the common power of a peaceable assemblage to keep order, and expel disorderly persons. That power is not a question here. Hiss v. Bartlett, 3 Gray, 468; Cooley Const. Lim. 133; Bradlaugh v. Gossett, Law Rep. 12 Q. B. Div. 271.
It has been seen, in the cases above cited, that, while denying that a mere legislative assembly, as such, has power to punish for contempt in refusing to answer questions, the cases have admitted that this power resides â€?in courts. The reason for this is that, while legislation is the establishing of rules for the future, judicial action is the deciding upon the past, and awarding punishment or recompense to litigants. Hence it is necessary that the litigants should be enabled to show to the court, by witnesses, the truth as to the past. Hence the power to punish a refusal to answer.
Here then we must notice that by the constitution the legislature has certain judicial powers. Each branch is the judge of the qualifications of its own members. Art: 3, Â§ 10. This power is judicial in character, though often partisan in fact. There is a power to remove certain judicial officers. Art. 6, Â§ 11. There is a power of impeachment. Art. 6, Â§ 1. These are judicial powers. They imply a decision on past occurrences and a giving judgment accordingly. It may be, therefore, that in all actions of this kind, the senate and the assembly may rightfully enforce the same power of punishing for refusing to answer questions which is exercised by courts. These cases, therefore, we exclude from consideration. The relator was not examined in any such case.
Aside from these cases, the Constitution gives the Senate and Assembly only legislative power. Judicial power, on the other hand, is vested in the courts named in the Constitution, and in such inferior courts as may be created. And it is evident that the grant of judicial power to the courts is an implied prohibition of its assumption by the legislature, except as authorized by the Constitution. Leggett v. Hunter, 19 N. Y. 463. â€œAll the powers entrusted to government, whether State or national, are divided into three grand departments: the executive, the legislative and the judicial. It is also essential to the successful working of this system that the persons â–?entrusted with power in any one of these branches shall not be permitted to encroach upon the powers confided to the others; but that each shall, by the law of its creation, be limited to the exercise of the power appropriated to its own department and no other.â€?Kilbourn v. Thompson, supra. It would hardly be claimed that the legislature could make itself, or one of its branches, an appellate tribunal from the Court of Appeals, or that it could authorize either of its branches to try a person indicted for murder, or to try a civil action.
It is further claimed, on the part of the respondent, that, under 1 R. S. m. p. 154, Â§ 3, sub. 4, the senate was authorized to imprison the relator. Mow we must here notice that nothing is gained by calling the act for which a person may be imprisoned, according to that statute, a breach of privilege. It has already been shown that privileges, as known in the English Parliament, do not necessarily belong to these legislative bodies of Senate and Assembly. Whatever authority they have comes from the Constitution. If the Constitution, fairly construed, gives them authority to enact a law of this kind, then the law is valid ; otherwise not. Taylor v. Porter, 4 Hill, 140; Powers v. Bergen, 6 N. Y. 366.
What then is the nature of the punishing for contempt in 'refusing to answer ? It is clearly judicial. It includes the deciding upon a question of fact, viz.: whether the alleged act has been committed ; and upon a question of law, viz.: whether the inquiry was material, and the further determination of the proper punishment to be inflicted. So the resolution of the Senate shows under which McDonald was committed. It recites that he has been â€?declared guilty â€? and â€?convicted â€?and it announces a punishment. The conclusion then is inevitable that the proceeding was judicial, involving a trial and a punishment for wrong-doing.
When courts punish .a witness for refusing to answer, their act is one in aid of a judicial proceeding, viz., the litigation which is then pending. It is also itself a judicial act; a trial before the court then sitting, instead of, or it may be, in addition to, a trial before some other court. It is done in aid of the interest of litigants, who have a right to know the facts which the witness refuses to disclose. It is for their sake that this light has always been exercised.
If then this statute be valid, the legislature can confer upon itself judicial authority to try, convict and punish. We see no. warrant for'this in the Constitution. It might be that the. legislature could authorize the Governor, in matters committed to him, such, for instance, as the granting of pardons, to receive-the testimony of witnesses. Would it be thought a lawful exercise of power to authorize the Governor to punish for contempt a witness who should refuse to answer ? Certain corporations are required to make on oath, returns to certain state officers. Could these officers be vested with a power to punish as for contempt a refusal to make such returns ?
We are not here called upon to say that the legislature cannot pass a valid law, requiring witnesses to testify before committees who are engaged in proper investigations, and declaring a refusal to be a misdemeanor. The question here raised is as to the power of a branch of the legisluture itself to punish for the violation of such a law. The statutes of every year are full of provisions requiring citizens to do some act. The refusal to do the act is usually a misdemeanor. Can the legislature, or a branch of it, try the offender? Certainly not. By what right then can the legislature assume judicial authority in this case rather than in any other ?
But it may be urged that the right to summon a witness and to hear testimony, necessarily includes a right to compel the giving of testimony by imprisonment. By no means. Passing, for the present, the question as to the right of the legislature to take testimony for mere legislative purposes, we shall see that, even in courts, the right to punish a witness by imprisonment does not always exist; as, for instance, in justicesâ€?courts. Code Civ. Pro. Â§ 2974. The contempts which a justice may punish as criminal are few; and the refusal to testify is not one of them. Section 2870. The aggrieved party is left to his action for damages. Section 2979. And the witness remains probably subject to punishment in a criminal court. Penal Code, Â§ 143, sub. 6.
And certainly if we were to consider the question, not as one of law, but as one of wise protection to the witness, it would be best that his punishment for a refusal should be left' to the courts. In trials before courts there are opposite parties. The witness appears for one or the other, and he is practially within the protection of the party for whom he appears. If there be a doubt as to his obligation to answer some question, he is sure to be protected by the arguments of one side or the other. And no decision is made until the matter has been fairly considered. But in a case like the present it is very different. The committee of the senate is investigating; searching for facts in any way and by any questions. There is no impartial tribunal to decide whether the question is proper or not. The senate prosecutes the inquiry ; the senate decides the question to be proper; the senate refuses to allow the witness counsel; and the senate sends him to jail.
We pass to consider some authorities. That of Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, is usually relied upon to sustain the inherent power of legislative bodies to punish"" for refusal to answer. It is followed in Wichelhausen v. Willets, supra, and is the basis of the dietum in 1 Kent Com. 236. It is enough to say that it is overruled by Kilbourn v. Thompson, supra, and by Kielley v. Carson, supra. The case of Burnham v. Morrison, 14 Gray, 226, rests upon an express provision in the constitution of Massachusetts. Furthermore, in the opinion it is stated that: â€?The house of representatives is the grand inquest for the commonwealth, and as such has power to inquire into the official conduct of all officers of the commonwealth, with a view to impeachment.â€?We have already said that the present case does not belong to that part of the powers of the senate. Hor is the senate in any case, an impeaching body. In Whitcombâ€™s case, 120 Mass. 118, it was held that the legislature could not confer upon a body not judicial the power to punish for contempt. In People v. Learned, Sup. Ct. 5 Hun, 626, the principal' argument of the .counsel in behalf of the power to punish, rested on the position that the body, to which the power had been given, was a court. On the other hand, the counsel for the prisoner, led by the decision in Anderson v. Dunn and the like, admitted in argument the existence in legislative bodies of the power to punish for contempt in refusing to answer. On these lines of argument, therefore, it is not strange that the opinion in that case has not a word on the question here involved. That case was taken to the Court of Appeals ; and when it came on to be argued, the attorney-general stipulated not to enforce the warrant of commitment, and, against the protest of the prisonerâ€™s counsel, the court refused to hear the argument. 16 Alb. L. J. 96. This course was the more noticeable, as there were, in fact, other witnesses than Dennison who had in like manner refused to answer.
But again it is urged that, assuming that there may be some cases in which the senate might imprison for refusal to answer, (as, for instance, in the trial of charges against judicial officers), then the senate is the sole judge of the proper exercise of its powers, and the court can not interfer. But the contrary was held in Kilbourn v. Thompson, ut supra. In that case the court, passing the question whether the house of representatives might not commit for refusing to answer in a proper investigation, and admitting that the house might commit for a refusal to answer in election cases and the like, yet claimed for itself the right to examine whether, in the case then in question, the power was lawfully exercised. And in the language of the court in that case: â€œWe cannot' give our assent to the principle that, by the mere act of asserting a person to be in contempt, they (the senate) thereby establish their right to fine and imprison him, beyond the power of any court or other tribunal to inquire into the grounds on which the order was made.â€?To the same effect are some of the remarks in Burnham v. Morrissey, supra.
It may, however, be said that section 2032, subdivision 3, Code Civil Procedure, required the court to remand the prisoner. In the case of commitment by courts the aggrieved party has his remedy by appeal or certiorari, as the case may be. Hence he should not be allowed to review by habeas corpus. There seem to be exceptions, even in these cases. People ex rel. Tweed v. Liscomb, 60 N. Y. 559. But in the present case there can be no review of the action of the senate by appeal or certiorari. It must then be the right of the aggrieved party to bring his case before the court. To hold that the legislature could commit for contempt, and then could forbid all inquiry into the rightful exercise of the power, would be to take away the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus. Const. art. 1, Â§ 4. Unless the question as to the lawfulness of McDonaldâ€™s imprisonment can here be examined in every view, then the Senate, when not acting as a court, may imprison a man, and there can be no judicial protection to him whatever. But whether the witness was bound to answer depends on legal principles, on which he is entitled to a judicial decision. Stockdale v. Hansard, 9 Ad. & El. 1. It is the very basis of liberty that no person shall be imprisoned unless the right to imprison him has been, or may be, determined by the judiciary. People ex rel. Lawrence v. Brady, 56 N. Y. 182; Taylor v. Porter, 4 Hill, 140; Const. art. 1, Â§ 1. It must be for the court to decide whether he is deprived of his rights â€?by the law of the land.â€?And it may further be observed that section 2032, subdivision 3, Code Civ. Pro. refer, for the definition of criminal contempts, to section 8. And section 8 limits the power to punish such contempts to courts of record, and thus limits such contempts to acts done in contempt of such courts.
Probably the question as to the right of either branch of the legislature to make investigations is not necessarily before us. As long as witnesses are willing to answer questions, there seems to be nothing for the court to. decide. Ã‘or is it quite easy, when a question like the present does arise, to lay down a rule limiting the right of investigation. For the resolution of investigation perhaps need not express the ultimate object to be attained. And possibly the legislature might be in search of information which would aid in legislation for the future.
In the case of Kilbourn v. Thompson, however, already cited, the court examined the resolution under which the investigation was carried on ; and remarked that it contained â€?no hint of any intention of final action by congress on the.subject,â€?and, continuing, they said : â€?Was it to be a fruitless investigation into the personal affairs of individuals ? If so, the house of representatives had no power or authority in the matter more than any other equal number of gentlemen interested for the government of their country.â€?The return to the writ of habeas corpus sets forth the warrant. This does not state the resolution of the senate, or the questions which McDonald refused to answer. A point may be made whether such a warrant is' good (Matter of Quin, 7 Abb. Dig. 402). By way of traverse to the return, the petitioner has set out the proceedings. The resolution recites that grave charges of fraud and irregularities have been made by the public press and the Union League Club against Hubert O. Thompson, Commissioner of Public Works of the city of Hew York; that in the opinion of many persons the charges have not been explained or refuted ; that it is important to taxpayers that heads of public departments should be beyond reproach ; and it then directs a committee of the Senate to investigate the department of public works in the city of Hew York. Ho further action is proposed by the resolution.
This department is not a state department. It is merely' one of the branches of the city government of Hew York. Except on account of the magnitude of its work, there is no more reason that the Senate should investigate this department, than that they should investigate the action of the highway commissioner of some town, charged with fraud and irregularities by the village newspaper and the frequenters of the village tavern. And it can be seen by this recital that this investigation was one appropriate for a grand jury. Ho legislation was proposed for the future. Ho redress could be given by the Senate for the past. If frauds had been committed, â€?the case, being one of a judicial character, for which the powers of the courts usually afford the only remedy, it may well be supposed that those powers were more appropriate and more efficient in aid of such relief than the powers which belong to a body whose function is exclusively legislative.â€?Kilbourn v. Thompson, supra. It has not been suggested, upon the argument, that any action could be taken by the Senate which would redress these alleged frauds and irregularities.
In the view, however, which we have taken, that, except when acting as a court, neither branch of the legislature has power to punish, as for contempt, the wrong-doing, if it be such, of a witness in not answering, we do not consider it necessary to decide whether, if he should be brought before a court in a proper manner, McDonald could successfully claim that the investigation was unwarranted.
We might leave the matter here. But other points have been argued which we will consider. W e come then to the specific questions, for refusing to answer which the witness was punished. These are not pointed out in the proceedings before the Senate. But an examination of the proceedings before the committee indicates that the following are the only questions which the witness refused to answer, when required:
Do you keep books of this coal business ?
Do you carry on your coal business any differently, or upon any different system, from what you do your business with the city ?
How much coal do you keep at your dock ?
How much business do you do in the way of coal ? I mean, all the time.
Give me the name of somebody else besides Robert Gubbinsthat was breaking stone there for you ?
Who are they (from whom you get chips) except the Tompkins Cove people ?
So far as we can discover, these are the only questions which the witness refused finally to answer, after the committee had insisted on his answering. We must assume therefore that these are the â€?pertinent questions â€?referred to by the resolution of the Senate.
As to the questions respecting the business of the witness, we cannot see the least pertinency to the subject of investigation. There does not appear to be anything connecting the coal business with the alleged frauds and irregularities. The questions were impertinent, should not have been asked, and need not have been answered.
The question as to who was breaking stone for witness is liable to the same objection. The resolution of the Senate did not permit an inquiry as to the persons employed by a witness, who was not himself an officer, or employee of the department.
Nor was the witness obliged to tell where he obtained the limestone chips. That was strictly his own business. No question was put tending to show that chips belonged to the city, before the witness delivered them. And if not, it was immaterial where he obtained them.
There had been many questions asked prior to these, which seem to have been even less material and less pertinent to the investigation than these. But the witness being at that time unattended by counsel, had answered them. Subsequently he procured counsel. His counsel was permitted to be present â€?as a matter of curtesy,â€?but upon his advising the witness not to answer certain questions, the committee refused any longer1 to recognize the right of the witness to have counsel; and thereupon the witness withdrew. Thus the committee appear to have been willing to have the counsel present so long as he gave no advice. The committee had their own counsel acting for them and conducting the examination. The course of the examination showed an intention to charge the witness himself as a party to the alleged frauds and irregularities.
The committee in the present case, after an executive session, formally ruled that â€?all questions must be answered that do not tend to criminate a witness; that the committee will judge as to whether the questions asked will criminate the witness or not.â€?Thus the committee insisted that questions should be answered, although they were immaterial, and although they would tend to degrade the witness. See People v. Brown, 72 N. Y. 571. The committee and their counsel naturally desired to get all the testimony which they thought might be of any use to them. They would not be likely to exclude questions put by their own counsel. And we see.no reason why the committee should have excluded a legal adviser of the witness, if he desired to have one present. It was unjust to the witness that he should be exposed to the imlimited examination of shrewd counsel without having any one to advise and protect him.
No complaint was made of any improper conduct on the part of counsel. He was excluded simply because, in good faith, he endeavored to protect his client against an improper course of examination. The case may not strictly come under the constitutional provision article I., section 6; because this proceeding was not a trial. But it seems to us a matter of common sense that a citizen, though he be a witness before a legislative committee, should have a right, in an orderly manner, to take advice of counsel as to matters which may seriously affect him or his business. This is not saying that the advice of counsel will protect him, should the court think the question was proper. It is only asserting the very common right of a citizen to take legal advice when he wishes. And the question was so decided in a similar case: Stewart v. Turner, 3 Ed. Ch. 458. There it was held that on the examination of a witness before a master in chancery, the witness -had a right, in the presence of a master, to consult his own counsel as to the propriety, or duty, of answering any question proposed to him.
We are therefore of the opinionâ€?1. That the questions put were immaterial and that the-witness was not bound tÃ³ answer them.
2. That the witness had a right to have the advice of counsel, in an orderly manner, and that, when this was refused, he was justified in withdrawing.
3. That, except when engaged in the judicial functions authorized by the constitution, neither branch of the legislature has any power to punish as for contempt for refusal tÃ³ answer a question.
4. That the order refusing to discharge McDonald should be reversed and that he should be discharged.

1167672,DALY v. PEOPLE,1884-01,"Daniels, J.
At the close of the trial, and before the cause was submitted to the jury, the court was requested to hold and direct them that the defendant could not be convicted of the offense charged against him in different counts of the indictment, as murder in the second degree. This was refused and exceptions were taken to the decisions on behalf of the defendant. By the evidence it was made to appear that the defendant and four other persons, together assaulted and beat the deceased. They had him down upon the street, one of them struck him with a stone, and others cut him with knives.
What caused their disagreement out of which this assault upon him originated, did not clearly appear. They all drank together, and Daly and the deceased scuffled together. He was also knocked down, and at least three of these persons weie engaged in beating and cutting him while he was down. In doing this a stone was used by one of them, and knives by the others. But out of their preceding relations no evidence was given indicating that the assailants had any motive, or that it was any part of their design, to kill the deceased. The weapons and stone made use of were not applied in such a manner as to be evidence that they entertained that design, for none of the wounds made upon the deceased, as they were described, were so aimed or serious, as in the judgment of the first physician who was called and dressed them, could possibly be attended with the death of the deceased. While he had been struck upon his head and wounds inflicted by cuts upon his body, they were neither of them, nor altogether, considered of a dangerous character, and were inflicted evidently more for the- purpose of punishing the deceased on account of some unexplained disagreement, than with any intention to produce his death. This assault took place upon a Sunday night and he died the next night. A post-mortem examination was made of his body, and it was found that he had died from what was stated by the surgeon to be, meningitis. His statements of the wounds confirmed the description given by the physician who first examined and treated the deceased. But he added further that it was probable that this disease had been produced by an injury to the head, from the blows it had received, or from a fall, that under the circumstances they were likely to have been the cause developing this disease. But, after allowing all the weight that can be given to the evidence of the surgeon making this final examination, nothing can be held to have been added to the case which would sustain the conclusion that in the blows which were inflicted, the defendant, or either of his associates, was actuated with the design to take the life of the deceased. It is highly probable, that as they were all more or less affected by drinking, that some common cause of disagreement arose between them, as is frequently the case with persons stimulated in this manner, leading them into the fight with the defendant, and that this was produced by such a provocation, as induced them severely to chastise him, without intending to kill him. It was what may be called a drunken brawl, not infrequently resulting in more serious consequences than either of the persons engagedâ€™in it intended or expected. Heither the acts themselves, nor the instruments made use of, nor the wounds inflicted upon the body, with any reasonable degree of certainty, will sustain the conclusion that there was any intention on the part of either of the assailants to kill the person so assailed.
The court, therefore, should have directed the jury, that the defendant could not be convicted of the crime of murder in the second degree, for the existence of an intent to kill is indispensable under the statute to the commission of that offense. The offense committed by these persons was clearly one of manslaughter, not that of murder.
The judgment should, therefore, be reversed and a new trial ordered. So ordered.

1167691,PEOPLE v. MASCHKE,1884-03,"Daniels, J.
The appellant was convicted in the court of Special Sessions of the misdemeanor of assault and battery upon John G. Griffith committed in said city, and upon his conviction for the misdemeanor aforesaid he was ordered and adjudged to be imprisoned in the penitentiary of the city of New York for the term of three months. The habeas corpus was issued for his discharge upon the ground that he was tried and convicted of an offense over Which the court of Special Sessions did not have jurisdiction, and while the offense for which the conviction was had is now by section 219 of the Penal Code designated an assault in the third degree, it still continues to be what was before the enactment of this Code known as an assault and battery. The argument that the assault may have been a felonious one and therefore not within the jurisdiction of the court before which the trial was had, is not supported by the record of the conviction. For by that it appears that the assault and battery of which he was convicted was a misdemeanor and that was equivalent to the assertion or statement that it was an assault in the third degree, and probably a mere statement of the fact that he had been convicted of an assault and battery without anything further, would be entitled to the same consideration and effect.
Certainly where a conviction is drawn in question collaterally, as it has been by means of this writ of habeas corpus, that should be the construction adopted in support of the conviction.
The writ was properly dismissed, and the order should be affirmed.

1167688,PEOPLE v. IRVING,1884-04,"Finch, J.
Upon the trial of an indictment for assault and battery the defendant testified in his own behalf as a witness. According to the evidence of a complainant and one witness who corroborated him, the assault was without provocation, and so brutal and causeless, as to indicate in the perpetrator either temporary intoxication or unusual ugliness of temper. But according to the evidence of the accused and of three witnesses whom he called in his behalf, the complainant rushed at him with abusive language and a bottle in his hand, and the defendant merely laughed and walked out. And these witnesses further said that after this occurred the complainant and one McDermott had a fight, from which inferentially, the complainantâ€™s injuries might have arisen. A question of fact of a very serious character was thus presented to the jury. There was falsehood upon one side or the other, and to reach the truth much regard was to be had to the respective credibility of the witnesses and to their moral character. The cross-examination of the complainant recognized the situation, and a series of disparaging questions were put to him and answered, as to whether â–?he had kept a gambling house, had been arrested for beating a woman, had bitten a manâ€™s thumb off, had shot a man named Miller; none'of which were objected to. .If the complainant had done these things, if he was the sort of man such a history described, it was due to the accused, whose liberty was imperiled by' the testimony, that the jury should learn something of the character of the witness.
On the cross-examination of the accused similar disparaging questions were put, but to these, objections were interposed, which were overruled, and the exceptions taken are now before us.
All of the inquiries except two were answered in the negative. The prosecution was bound by these replies, and the series of questions- thus answered cast ho discredit upon the witness, and did him no possible harm. The jury were bound by his denials, and the inquiries drew out no facts from which discreditable inference could be drawn. The answers rendered the questions innocuous. But that cannot so easily be said of the remaining two inquiries. One of them, however, does not raise the question sought to be presented. The accused had just been asked if in 1870 he gouged both of the eyes out of a man named James and answered in the negative. He was then asked, â€œDidnâ€™t you do the same thing with a man named Ferguson in 1881 ? â€?to which he answered, â€?I did not gouge his eye out.â€?That answered the inquiry. Nothing further in respect to that occurrence was asked of the witness and no added statement was required. What followed was his own voluntary declaration, which he need not have made, and which was not drawn from him by any question of the prosecutor. The witness added, â€?I struck him,â€?and then went on to explain the circumstances, showing plainly that Ferguson was the aggressor, and the accused acted only on the defensive.
But the inquiry whether the witness did not assault Smith Weed, a member of the legislature, and which was answered in the affirmative, although followed by an explanation, cannot be certainly deemed harmless, and is not, therefore, to be' deemed within the doctrine of Nolan v. Brooklyn City and N. Y. R. R. Co. (87 N. Y. 68). There the witness was asked, not what he had dune, but what the Fire Department had done; whether it had expelled him. We have held of late that mere charges or accusations, or even indictments may not so be inquired into, since they are consistent with innocence, and may exist without moral delinquency. People v. Crape, 76 N. Y. 288 ; People v. Brown, 72 N. Y. 571; Ryan v. People, 79 N. Y. 594. An expulsion from the Fire Department might be summary or arbitrary, and with little or no chance of a fair trial, or for causes involving no crime, and not affecting the moral character; and so it turned out upon the answer given, which effectually barred any injurious inference. But this is not such a case. The witness was asked if he assaulted a fellow member of the legislature and was expelled from that body. He denied the expulsion, but admitted the assault. He confessed what unexplained, was the commission of a crime, and as was said in People v. Brown (supra), tended to impair the credit of the witness â€œby its tendency to establish a bad moral character.â€?In a closely balanced case it could hardly fail to affect his credibility. We have read carefully the explanation which the accused gave. It does not mend the matter much. At all events we cannot say that, taking question and answer and explanation all together, the product was not an injury to the accused.
That brings us to the inquiry whether the question asked was proper. We think it was so, within the discretion of the trial court, and its permission not an abuse of that discretion. The rule, as it stood before any restriction or limitation was put upon it, was stated in Real v. People (42 N. Y. 281), where the witness was such merely and not the party. It was then said that for the purpose of discrediting his testimony the witness may be asked upon cross-examination as to specific acts, and the propriety and need of such a rule was argued at length. In People v. Crapo (supra), the limitation was applied that facts must be inquired about and not mere accusations, whose truth was not presumed, and which, therefore, did not tend to impair the moral character. That decision was made in 1879, and just one year later than the case of People v. Casey, (76 N. Y. 288), which decides the precise question here involved, and in which the chief judge, who wrote the opinion in the Crapo case concurred. The prisoner stood-indicted, for assault with a dangerous weapon, and testified on his own behalf. On cross-examination the prosecutor was permitted to question him as to other altercations in which he had been engaged, and other assaults which he had committed, and it was held no error. Facts were asked for there, and not accusations or irresponsible charges, and so occasion arose for the limitation which one year later was needed and applied. A little later, in Ryan v. People (supra), the rule Was still conceded that questions as to specific facts which tend to discredit the witness or impair his moral character may be asked on cross-examination, b.ut it was held that an indictment was a mere accusation and had no such legitimate tendency. In People v. Noelke (94 N. Y. 143, 144; 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 495), the cases were reviewed and we had on an.indictment and trial for selling lottery tickets, that the defendant testifying in his own behalf might be asked on cross-examination, not only whether he has been convicted for sending lottery papers through the mail, but also whether for a period extending before the offense with which he was charged he had been engaged in the lottery business.
The General Term seems to have thought that an assault committed upon other persons â€œwould not necessarily or â€¢properly tend to impeach the moral character or impair the credit of the witness.â€?We held the exact contrary in People v. Casey. The questions there sustained were admissible upon^ that ground alone, and the case is decisive o""f this. The assault upon Weed, unexplained and unjustified, was a crime punishable by fine or imprisonment. It indicated disregard of the law, contempt for personal rights, and an ungovernable temper prompting to a criminal act. If we are ever to foam through our Penal Code, in search of a crime capable of being committed, without indicating a defective moral character, we shall not select the one here in question.
Whether the pistol in the hands of the defendant was an instrument or thing likely to produce grievous bodily harm was a question of fact for the jury. Nelson v. People, 23 N. Y. 298; Abbott v. People, 86 N. Y. 471. Although the weapon was not produced or otherwise described than by its common name, yet it was capable of being used otherwise than by firing; and such description by its name, in connection with the character of the wound inflicted, was sufficient to carry to the jury the question of fact.
We discover no"" error in the record, and the judgment should be affirmed.

1167701,PEOPLE v. BORK; PEOPLE ex rel. BORK v. GILBERT,1884-05,"Andrews, J.
The defendant was convicted on June 13, 1881, at a court of Oyer and Terminer, in and for the county of Erie, held by Judge Daniels and two justices of the Sessions, under chapter 19 of the Laws of 1875, of the crimes of peculation and embezzlement. The jury rendered a general verdict of guilty, as charged in the indictment, but made no finding in respect to any loss resulting from the crime. Before sentence, the defendant sued out a writ of certiorari to review the conviction, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court, and afterward by this court. People v. Bork, 91 N. Y. 5. Subsequently, and on May 3, 1883, at a court of Oyer and Terminer, in Erie county, held by the same persons who constituted the court at the time of the trial, the defendant was sentenced on the conviction of June 13, 1881, to imprisonment in the state prison for the term of five years.
Two questions are presented by the defendantâ€™s counsel on this appeal, first, as to the legality, under the act of 1875, of a general verdict of guilty, unaccompanied with any finding by the jury of the amount of loss resulting from the crime, and second., the legality of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, as constituted when the sentence was pronounced, to render judgment. The Act of 1875 is aimed primarily at peculations of public moneys by officials. The first section, after defining the offense, declares that a defendant, on conviction thereof, â€?shall be punished by imprisonment in a State prison for a term not less than three years or more than ten years, or by a fine not exceeding five times the toss resulting from the fraudulent act or acts which he shall have so committed^ aided or abetted, to-be ascertained, as hereinafter mentioned, or by both such imprisonment and fine.â€?The third section declares that â€?when-rendering a verdict of guilty upon the trial of any person-indicted under this act, the jury may find and state with their verdict the amount of loss resulting from the offense of the-defendant.â€?It is claimed on the part of the defendant that upon a conviction under this act, a special finding by the jury of the-amount of the loss resulting from the crime, is an indispensable-incident to a legal verdict, without which no valid judgment can be rendered. The general argument in support of this claim is, that as by the first section a discretion is given to the court on conviction to punish, by fine, or imprisonment, or both, and as the amount of the fine is to- be fixed with reference to the amount of the loss, to be ascertained by the jury, there is no basis for the exercise of the discretion vested in the court, in the absence of a finding by the jury, ascertaining the loss. We have no doubt that if was the intention to confer upon the court in all cases the discretion to punish a defendant convicted under the statute, in one or both the ways mentioned. This discretion may be exercised so as either to increase or diminish the punishment.â€? The court may punish by ta sentence of imprisonment for the longest term specified, and in addition by the largest fine. On the other hand, it may limit the punishment to a fine only. The discretion, therefore, cannot be said to have been conferred solely in the interest, and-for the benefit of a defendant.
The argument that the permissive language of the third section, that the jury may, with their verdict, find the loss, must be construed as mandatory and imperative, is based, as we have said, upon, the assumption that the discretion to fine, conferred by the first section, can only be exercised when there is a special finding by the jury outside of the general verdict.
We cannot assent to the view of. the counsel for the people that a general verdict of guilty under the Act of 1875 is equivalent to a special finding, that the loss resulting from the offense is the value of the property converted as alleged in the indictment. This in most cases would not be true as matter of fact. The value of property stolen or converted is not usually -stated with accuracy in an indictment, nor would it follow that the loss resulting from the conversion of property, in violation .-of the act, would equal the value of the property converted. The property may have been recovered, or restitution may have been made, and it is the amount of loss, and not the value of the converted property by which the fine is to be measured. In an indictment for larceny, the degree of the crime, whether grand or petit larceny, depends upon the value of the property stolen. This is an issuable fact, and the .jury may be required to make a special finding of value with a view to. determine the grade of the offense, and when made this is. a ;part of the verdict; and when there is no special finding, a gen eral .verdict of guilty in the absence of a special statute is held.to find the value as charged. 1 How. P. C. ch. 19, Â§ 2; Hale's P. C. ch. 45, p. 540 ; 2 Barb. Crim. Pr. Â§ 764.
But under the statute in question, the value of the property converted is not an element of the crime, nor are there any degrees of crime under this statute. The crime is complete, whatever may be the value of the property converted, but the fine may be graduated by the . resulting loss. The amount of the loss is an extrinsic fact which does not enter into the definition of the offense.
The indictment in this case, charges the conversion by the defendant of 200 bonds of the value of $1,000 each. But the inquiry upon the trial related to fifteen or twenty bonds of that denomination. Upon the theory that a general verdict of guilty under the Act of 1875, finds affirmatively all the facts charged in the indictment, including the allegation of value, and that a finding of value is a finding of the loss resulting from the crime, the-defendant could have been sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000,000, a result so manifestly absurd that the reasoning upon which it rests must be rejected- as unsound. But we are of opinion that a special finding by the jury of the amount of loss is not an essential condition to the exercise by the court of the power to sentence a defendant in accordance with the first section of the Act of 1875.
The statute makes no provision for the ascertainment of the loss in case of a conviction without trial, upon a plea of guilty. The method of ascertaining the loss by a finding of the jury, in connection with their verdict on the trial of the issues, is inapplicable to a conviction on confession without -trial. If, therefore, the jurisdiction of the court to -inflict the alternative punishment depends upon the special finding of the jury of the amount of the loss, then in case of conviction upon a plea of guilty, either no punishment could be inflicted, or punishment by imprisonment only.
But this result manifestly was not intended, and the statute should be construed, if possible, so as to avoid such a dilemma. The language of the third section is permissive and not imperative. The jury, the statute declares, may find with their verdict the amount of the loss. The second section regulates the amount of the fine by the loss, â€œto be ascertained as hereinafter mentioned,â€?referring to the finding by the jury, provided for in the third section.
The second section does not declare that the loss shall be ascertained in the manner pointed out-in the third section.
We think the statute may be held harmonious and consistent, by reading the words â€?to be ascertained â€?in the first section, as if they were â€?which may be ascertained.â€?This reconciles the provisions of both sections, in harmony with the general intention, and makes the statute capable of a consistent execution. Upon a conviction upon a plea of guilty, the court, for the purpose of fixing the punishment, may take proof, by affidavit or otherwise, of the circumstances of the offense, including the amount of the loss resulting from the crime. People v. Taylor, 3 Denio, 96. When the case is tried by jury, the jury may ascertain the loss and return it with their verdict. If the jury make no special finding, the court, for the purpose of determining the punishment may proceed summarily to ascertain the loss, as in the case of a conviction without trial.' We have no doubt of the right of a defendant, when evidence has been given upon the subject, to have the jury instructed, in case they should render a verdict of guilty, to return therewith a finding of the amount of loss. He may in this way have the benefit, if any there be, of this provision of the statute.
But in the absence of such evidence, or of any request to the court to direct a special finding, we think a general verdict of guilty is lawful. The defendant made no request for a special finding, and took no objection to the form of the verdict at the time it was rendered.
The next question relates to the legality of the organization of the court of Oyer and Terminer which pronounced sentence upon the defendant. It is claimed that the judgment is void for the reason that two justices of the sessions sat with Judge Daniels as members of the court at that time, and participated in the proceedings. The record shows that the court was composed of Judge Daniels, and Fayette M. Reed and Seth A. Abbott, Justices of Sessions. The legality of the court as thus constituted is challenged on the ground that the constitution of courts of Oyer and Terminer was charged by chapter 280, of the Laws of 1882, amending section 23 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The section as amended is as follows: â€?A court of Oyer and Terminer is held by a justice of the Supreme Court, without an associate.â€?The amendment of 1882 was passed after the' trial of the defendant, but before sentence. Prior to 1882, courts off Oyer and Terminer in counties other than the county of New York, were composed of a justice of the Supreme Court presiding, and the county judge of the county, and the justices of the peace, designated as members of the Court of Sessions, but the court could be held by the presiding judge, and any two of the other officers named. Laws of 1847, ch. 280, Â§ 38.
It is claimed on the part of the people, that the indictment, trial and conviction of the defendant having taken place before the passage of the act of 1882, the case is excepted from its operation by section 962 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. That section is as follows: â€?This Code applies to criminal actions, and to all other proceedings in criminal cases which are herein provided for, from the time when it takes effect; but all such actions and proceedings theretofore commenced, must be conducted in the same manner as if this Code had not been passed.â€?But we are of opinion that this section simply preserves the existing rules of procedure in pending cases. They are to be conducted in the same manner as if the Code had not been passed. There was a manifest propriety that criminal actions and proceedings commenced under the former system should be carried to completion under the procedure under which they were instituted, and this, we think, was the scope and purpose of the exception. If it was intended to continue the existing organization of criminal courts as to all pending criminal actions and proceedings, then the result would be that every indictment found before the passage of the act of 1882, and triable in courts of Oyer and Terminer, must be tried by those courts as then constituted. There would be in each county a court of Oyer and Terminer held by a justice of the Supreme Court, and two associates having jurisdiction of indictments found before the amendment of 1882, and a court of Oyer and Terminer, held by a single judge without associates, having jurisdiction of indictments found after that time.
We are of opinion that the direction in section 962, that criminal actions and proceedings theretofore commenced, â€?must be conducted in the same manner,â€?etc., has no reference to the organization of criminal courts, but to the procedure in such courts. This point was decided by the General Term in the Fourth Department in the case of People v. Ostrander (29 Hun, 515; 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 274), which was affirmed in this court by default. The defendant in that case' had been tried and convicted of murder prior to the act of 1882, and after the passage of that act was sentenced to death â€?by a court of Oyer and Terminer, held by a single judge, under the act of 1882. It was held that the court had jurisdiction to pronounce the sentence, and the judgment was subsequently executed.
It is also claimed on the part of the people, that independently of the exception in section 962, the legislature could not authorize judgment to be pronounced on a conviction had before the passage of the act of 1882, by a court differently constituted from that before which the trial was had. We think this claim is untenable. It is undoubtedly true that the legal constitution of a criminal court before which a trial is commenced cannot be changed during its progress. But the organization of courts of Oyer and Terminer, with the exception that a justice of the Supreme Court must preside, is within the control of the legislature. People v. Smith, 47 N. Y. 303. A change in the persons who compose the court, or in the number of judges, does not change its essential character. The act of 1882 effected an immediate change in the organization of courts of Oyer and Terminer. They were thereafter to be held by a justice of the Supreme Court only. But the tribunal was not changed. Ho new court was constituted. The courts under the new organization exercise the functions and jurisdiction they formerly exercised, not by transfer, nor substitution, nor as successors of the prior courts, but as the same courts, changed only by limiting the exercise of judicial power therein to one of the three persons who formerly composed them.
We know of no constitutional principle which requires that judgment on a conviction for crime must he pronounced by the same judges before whom the trial was had. It has never been supposed that the death of a judge after conviction of a defendant would prevent sentence, but this would follow if the contention should be admitted, that the same judge who tried the case must pronounce the judgment. We are of opinion that a court of Oyer and Terminer organized under the act of 1882, might lawfully pronounce sentence in this case, and that from the passage of that act a court of Oyer and Terminer constituted under the law of 1847, was unauthorized. ,
We can see no answer to the proposition of the defendant that the judgment in thisâ€?case is void for the reason that the court which rendered it was not legally constituted. The same record which shows the presence of a justice of the Supreme Court presiding, also shows the presence of two justices of the Sessions, acting as members of the court. It must be presumed that they took part in the proceedings. They were recognized as constituent members of the court, upon the assumption that in pronouncing judgment in cases tried before the passage of the act of 1882, the court as originally organized was continued. If the associates could be treated a supernumeraries exercising no judicial function in the case, there would be no difficulty. The judgment rendered was one which the presiding judge, if sitting alonÃ©, was authorized to pronounce. But we do not see our way clear to treat the case as though the associates were not present. The vice of the judgment is that.it wÃ¡s rendered by a tribunal in which three persons sat as judges, all of whom participated in the proceedings, when by law but one of the persons constituting the court was qualified to sit or act, in rendering the judgment. It does not need the citation of authorities to the proposition that the judicial power can only be exercised according to law, and that an attempt by an unauthorized tribunal to render judgment involving life, liberty or property is a mere nullity. Ho man can be deprived of either without due process of law ; nor can any one exercise the judicial function without investiture by the sovereign power. See Oakley v. Aspinwall, 3 N. Y. 547 ; Cancemiâ€™s Case, 18 Id. 128 ; People v. Shaw, 63 Id. 36.
Having reached the conclusion that the sentence and judgment was void, it remains to consider what judgment shall be rendered by this court. The conviction having been lawful, the defendant cannot again be put upon trial. Shepherd v. People, 25 N. Y. 406 ; Ratzky v. People, 29 Id. 124. It was held in the cases last cited that prior to the act, chapter 236, Laws of 1863, there was no person in this court, on the reversal of a judgment of conviction.in a criminal case, either to re-sentence the prisoner, or to remit the case for re-sentence to the court below. The act of 1863 was passed to remedy this defect in legislation. It amended the section of the Revised Statutes prescribing the order to be made on the reversal of a conviction, by adding this provision: â€œprovided, however, that the appellate court shall have power upon any writ of error, where it shall appear that the conviction has been legal and regular, to remit the record to the court in which such conviction was had, to pass such sentence as the appellate court shall direct.â€?In Ratzkyâ€™s Case (supra), the court, having reversed the judgment on the ground of the unlawfulness of the sentence, remitted the record, under the statute of 1863, to the court in which conviction was had, with discretion to pronounce the appropriate sentence. The statute of 1863, so far as we can ascertain, has never been repealed in terms, and we think it is continued in force, as a rule of procedure, in respect to actions pending -when the Code of Criminal Procedure took effect, by force of section 962, above cited.
It is true that the act refers to the power of the appellate court upon a writ of error. But an appeal under the Code of Criminal Procedure is a substitute for a writ of error under the former practice. This case is brought up by appeal, although there may be doubt whether, as the case was pending when the Code was passed, a writ of error was not the proper proceeding. But however this may be, we think the statute was not repealed by a change made in the mere mode of bringing the case up for review. The object of the statute was to confer upon an appellate court the power to remit the case ""to the court below for judgment, on a reversal for error in the sentence, and this power we think continues under the act of 1863, at least as to cases pending when the new procedure was passed, notwithstanding the substitution of an appeal for a writ of error.
""We think that the proper order in this case is that the judgment be reversed, and the record be remitted to the court of Oyer and Terminer of Erie county, with direction to proceed and sentence the defendant under the act of 1875.
By the act of 1863,.the court to which the record is remitted is to pass, such sentence as â€?the appellate court shall direct.â€?We do not understand that the provision requires the appellate court to fix the time of imprisonment, or to itself exercise a discretion in respect to punishment given by the statute. It does direct the sentence within the meaning of the act of 18G3, when it points out the law providing for the punishment, and directs the court below to sentence thereunder.
Judgment reversed, and the record remitted to the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Erie county with direction to proceed and sentence the defendant under the act of 1875.
All concur.

1167695,PEOPLE v. CASEY,1883-12,"Dykman, J.
The defendant was tried for the crime of murder in the first degree, and convicted of that offense, and this is an appeal from the judgment of conviction.
The defendant and his victim, Richard Comisky, were both members of the police force of Long Island City, and on the morning of the homicide, he came to the station house from his duty, and went into the back room. There he called a brother officer and requested him to fix a revolver which he had in his hand. There was then one ball cartridge in the chamber. After it was put in order, it was returned to the defendant, who inserted two more balls in the chambers. Then he returned to the front room where the deceased was sitting, and asked him why he was following him around' nights, and the deceased said, â€?To make you do your duty.â€? The defendant then said to him, â€œI will kill you deadâ€â€”and immediately discharged the pistol once. The ball passed through his brain and caused his instant death. When asked why he did it, he said he could not help it, that the deceased had been following him around, and in reply to some other remark, he said, u Well, it canâ€™t be helped now it is done.â€?' This transpired in presence of two other police officers.
Insanity was interposed on the trial for a defense, and many witnesses were examined on the subject.
The jury rejected the plea, and found the defendant guilty of the crime.
There was no controversy respecting theâ€?main fact. The two officers who witnessed the fatal shot were examined and gave a circumstantial accountâ€?of the occurrence, and their testimony was in no wise contradicted.
There were very few exceptions taken on the trial, and none of them present any serious question.
Some exceptions were taken to the charge of the court to the jury, which call for examination. This was said: The test of responsibility for criminal acts where insanity is asserted, is the capacity of the accused to distinguish between right and wrong, at the time and with respect to the act which is the subject of inquiry ; that is the test of insanity.....But if he knew the effect of his acts, if he knew that it was wrong to kill and that he was liable to punishment for it, he is responsible to punishment, although he may have had insane delusions. At the close of the charge, the counsel for the defendant said : â€œIf your Honor please, I desire formally to except to that part of the charge coming from the court to the jury in which this idea is involved : the power to distinguish between right and wrong is the sole test of responsibility. I also except to this other part of the charge of the court: If the defendant knew it was wrong to shoot, he would be guilty, even though he had insane'delusions.â€?The Court: â€?I do not say that. I did not mean that he must have insane delusions in respect to the act. I say that if he knew right from wrong in respÃ©ct to the act done, at the time it was done, then he is answerable to punishment. . If there has crept ""into the charge any -such expression as that he is responsible even though he had insane delusions with respect to the "" act, I do not intend to say so, and I do not think I have said it.â€?Counsel for defendant: I will have this entered on the minutes, so that if it has crept into the charge I may have the benefit of any ill effect that it may have had with the jury: â€œIf he knew right from wrong, he was guiltyâ€?even though he had insane delusions.â€?It thus appears that if the charge as given respecting the possession of insane delusions by the accused, was erroneous, it was cured by the modification and Ã©xplanation ; but the test of responsibility laid down was also the subject of exception, and must be examined.
The schoolmen of medical science, versed in the intricacies of medical unsoundness and disorder, claim that in addition to mental capacity sufficient to distinguish between right and wrong, in relation to the act committed, juries in criminal cases where insanity is interposed as a defense, should be instructed, to require a mind with power to control itself in action before they will convict of crime. They claim that there is often, found a state of mental disorder in which the will cannot act, although the preeeption be perfect; that knowledge of right and wrong may be perfect while the power to choose may be paralyzed, and that when such a state of mind has resulted from permanent disorder, its possessor is not an accountable being. This doctrine, however, has attained no permanent place in the field of jurisprudence.
In this state the test of responsibility is the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong at the time the act was committed and in respect thereto ; and the law, as administered here in criminal cases, does not find irresponsibility where the claim is that capacity to distinguish right from wrong exists, without the power to choose between them. Flanagan v. People, 52 N. Y. 467.
The law imposes on all persons the duty to control their will power and resist evil influences and desires to prepetrate wrong and commit crimes, and they cannot secure immunity from punishment by permitting their will to pass beyond their control by the violence of frenzy or the paroxysm of rage. If they have capacity understanding to know that the act they are about to commit is forbidden by the laws of God and man, they must be held responsible. Human life would be insecure under any other rule of law, for anger and a desire for revenge may unseat the reason of a man perfectly sane, and cause him for a time to lose all control of his conduct or his will.
The charge of the court in this case on that subject was therefore a correct exposition of the law on the subject, and the exception thereto was unavailing.
The counsel for the defendant requested the court to charge the jury â€?that upon an interposition of the defence of insanity, and testimony adduced in support of the plea, the presumption of sanity in the accused is prima facie overcome ; and the people, before there can be a conviction, must satisfy the jury by affirmative proof of saneness, that the accused was not mentally diseased at the time of the shooting.â€?The Court: I will not charge that, and I make this explanation about it; that the rule as to sanity which governs the presumption is that every man is presumed to be sane, and that when a defendant accused of crime avers the plea, in his protection, he must prove it; it is his issue. Â¡But if on the whole proof there is a reasonable doubt of sanity, you will give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt, upon that issue or any other.â€?The counsel for the defendant: â€?I except to the declination to charge expressly as requested in this proposition and to the charge as given on that point.â€?Neither of these exceptions are well taken.
â–?While the utter irresponsibility of a madman, or a man who lacks sound memory, is recognized by our statute as well as by the common law, yet the presumption is in all cases that every man is sane, because sanity is the normal condition of men. The defense of insanity is an affirmative defense, to be established by the accused.
It is true that on the interposition of the defense of insanity the question was in the case, and the burden was on the prosecutor to show that the crime charged was committed by the defendant, and that he was at the time of the commission in a condition of mind to be responsible therefor.
On the first point affirmative proof was necessary in the first instance, but not on the second, because the presumption of sanity rendered it unnecessary and cast the burden of proof on the defendant; that is to say, the legal presumption of sanity was sufficient until repelled to establish the sanity of the defendant. If no evidence was adduced by the accused to establish his defense, it failed. If he did produce such proof, and answering proof was produced by the prosecution, then the burden was again on the prosecution to satisfy the jury on the whole evidence of the sanity and responsibility of the defendant. Oâ€™Connell v. People, 87 N. Y. 380; Brotherton v. People, 75 Id. 159.
These rules were not violated by this charge, because the jury was told that if on the whole proof there was a- reasonable doubt of sanity, the defendant must have the benefit of that doubt upon that issue as upon any other.
Counsel for the defendant asked the court to charge specifically that if the jurors have or any of the jurors had a reasonable doubt as to the sanity of the accused, at the very time of the shooting, the accused is entitled to the benefit of that doubt, and if the doubt is shared by all the twelve, there should be a verdict of acquittal, and if the doubt is held by one or more of the jurors there should be a disagreement.
This was refused except as charged, and the defendant excepted. This refusal must be sustained. It was not the duty of the court to charge the jury that there should be a disagreement in any"" emergency, and the-.-other portions of the request had been substantially charged before.
Again the counsel for the defendant requested the court to charge yes or no to this: that to-meet the requirements of the law and of justice, the verdict must be the result of twelve individual judgments uninfluenced by the separate judgment of any one or more of the persons composing the jury.
The Court.
"" They have to make up a verdict as to which they all agree. I will say nothing more.â€?To this there was an exception which cannot be sustained.
Another request to charge was as follows: â€?that it was the duty of the jurors to disagree if upon the. evidence in the case each of them, for himself, uninfluenced by the judgment of the others, has any reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the accused.â€?This was declined, except as charged, and the defendant excepted.
In relation to these last two requests it is sufficient to say that it was not the duty of the court to charge the jury that the individual judgment of a jurer was to be uninfluenced by the judgment of his compeers, or that it was the duty of jurors to disagree, if they had any doubt of the guilt of the accused on the evidence, or to resist the influence of the judgment of the other jurors. The law in no case contemplates the disagreement of a jury. On the contrary, it is the duty of jurors to agree if they can do so without the surrender of conscientious conviction. It is their duty to receive the law from the court and to examine and discuss the testimony with each other during their deliberations, to harmonize their views, and reach a conclusion if consonant with a proper sense of their judgment.
The court did charge the jury on the request of the defendant that if on the whole case there was a reasonable doubt, the defendant was entitled to the benefit of the doubt. This examination of the legal questions involved closed with a conclusion adverse to the appellant; so, also, must the examination of the facts close with the same result.
The act of the defendant which resulted in the death of his victim was not the offspring of delusion, or raving madness, and the testimony was sufficient to hold the defendant responsible for his act within the rule of legal: responsibility laid down in the charge. So the testimony was sufficient to justify the finding by the jury of deliberation and premeditation. It showed the absence of impulse, deliberate intention, reflection, and a selection and preparation of the means of death. We cannot interfere.
The judgment of conviction should be affirmed. Â¡

1167722,PEOPLE v. CASEY,1884-05,"Earl, J.
The defendant was put upon his trial for the crime of murder, and interposed challenges for actual bias to several persons who were called to act as jurors, which his counsel now claims were improperly overruled.
The Code of Criminal Procedure, section 376, provides, that â€?the previous expression or formation of an opinion or impression, in reference to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, or a present opinion or impression in reference thereto, is' not a sufficient ground for challenge for actual bias to any person otherwise legally qualified, if he declares on oath that he believes that such opinion or impression will not influence his verdict, and that he can render an impartial verdict according to the evidence, and the court is satisfied that he does not entertain such a present opinion or impression as would influence his verdict.â€?That provision is substantially a re-enactment of section 1 of the act, chapter 475 of the Laws of 1872. Notwithstanding this provision, a person who has formed or expressed an opinion or impression in reference to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, is still, as formerly, disqualified to sit as a juror, unless three things shall concur: (1) he must declare on oath that he believes that such opinion or impression will not influence his verdict; (2) he must also declare on oath that lie believes .lie can render an impartial verdict according to the evidence ; and (3) the court must be satisfied that he does not entertain such a present opinion or impression as would influence his verdict. Unless these three things concur the person must now, as before, be excluded from the jury box. Balbo v. People, 80 N. Y. 484 ; Cox v. People, Id. 500 ; People v. Cornetti, 92 lb. 85. The cases cited also hold that the decision â€¢of the trial judge in such a case, overruling the challenge, is reviewable in this court, and that it is our province and duty to determine upon the evidence elicited by the examination of the person, whether or not he was a competent juror.
Charles Davidson was called as a juror, and upon his examination testified that he had heard and read about the case, that what he had read left an impression on his mind for or against the defendant; that he had talked the case over with his neighbors, that in conversation with them he had expressed an opinion in reference to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, that he still had the opinion thus expressed, and that he was pretty sure he had said that he thought the defendant was guilty. This question was put to him by the District Attorney : â€œNotwithstanding that you have heard or read of it, or may have formed or expressed an opinion or impression, can you sit as a juror if selected, and determine this case upon the evidence as you shall hear it from the witnesses?â€?and he answered : â€?Well, I suppose I could.â€?The court ruled that he was a good juror. James Waldron was called as a juror, and testified upon his examination that he had read of the case, and formed an opinion or impression in reference to it; and then the District Attorney asked him this question: â€?Notwithstanding that, could you in your opinion sit here as a juror and determine it entirely upon the evidence in the case ?â€?and he answered â€œYes.â€?Upon his cross examination, he testified that he had read in the newspapers a criticism upon a dissenting juror upon a previous trial; that he had formed a distinct impression as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, that he still had that impression, that it would require evidence to remove it; and that he would go into the jury box, if accepted as a juror, with a prejudice in his mind as the result of the newspaper reading and the adverse criticism that he had seen in the public press. He was asked this question : â€œWould that definite, distinct impression that you have in your mind, would it shape or shadow your verdict at all?â€?and he answered, â€?Well, I would go according to the evidence, I think.â€?There were further questions and answers as follows : Q. â€?Apart from the evidence as it might be disclosed to you on the trial, would this previously formed impression or prejudice arising from yonr newspaper reading, aid at all in shaping and forming yonr verdict?â€?A. â€œWell, I donâ€™t know that it would.â€?Q. â€?Are you sure that it would not ?â€?A. â€œNo, sir; I am not sure about that.â€?Q. â€?And the impression that you had, after thinking this matter all over, after reading the newspaper articles, and after the conversation that yon had had with yonr neighbors was a distinct impressionâ€”is with you yetâ€?and it .would go with you into the jâ€™ury box, and you think might change, shade or shadow the verdict which you would give on the evidence?â€™â€?A. â€?Well, it might, but it hadnâ€™t ought to.â€?Q. â€?But you say that it might; you are not sure that you could divest your mind entirely of that prejudice ?â€?A. â€?No, sir.â€?The court sustained the competency of the juror.
Warren Willis was called as a juror, and upon his examination testified that he had heard and read of the case, and this question was put to him by the District Attorney : â€?Notwithstanding that fact, could you determine it according to the evidence if selected as a juror ?â€?A. â€?I suppose I could.â€?Q. â€?That is your opinion is it, that you could ? A. â€?Yes, I suppose I could.â€?He was then cross-examined by the defendantâ€™s counsel and testified that he had read accounts of the homicide in newspapers, and then he was questioned and answered as follows. Q. â€?Did the result of your newspaper reading or of any conversation that you might have had with any person, make any distinct impression on your mind concerning the guilt or innocence of the accused?â€?A. â€?Yes sir.â€?That impression is with you yet, is it?â€?A. â€?Yes sir, I think it. is.â€?Q. â€?In addition to the formation of an opinion, did you express any. opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner ?â€?A. â€œYes sir, I did, here in the courtroom.â€?Q. â€?Did you say you thought the defendant was guilty, or word's to that effect ?â€?A. â€œI might.â€?Q. â€œYou did make that statement ? â€?A. â€œYes sir, I think he is guilty from what I read.â€?Q. â€?I am not asking you what you think, I ask you whether you said so ?â€?A. â€?Yes sir, I think I have said so.â€?The court sustained the competency of the juror. Isaac Johnson was called as a juror, and upon his examination by the District Attorney, testified that he had heard about the case and had an impression about it. These questions were then put to him, and answered: Q. â€?Could you sit there as a juror and determine it according to the evidence in the case without regard to anything that you may have heard outside ?â€?A. â€?Well, according to what I have heard outside I have my mind about made up, I suppose.â€?Q. â€?Notwithstanding that fact that your mind is about made up, could you sit there as a juror and determine it entirely from the evidence which you would hear in the trial ?â€?A. â€?I suppose I would have to.â€?Q. â€?Without any regard to what you have heard outside ? â€?A. â€?I suppose I would have to go according to the witnesses, of coursre.â€?Q. â€?And you would do it, wouldnâ€™t you ?â€?(No answer.)
Upon his cross-examination he testified that he had had conversation about the homicide with other people; that there was an expression of opinion on the part of the other people about it; that he concurred with them ; that the way he heard the story it seemed to him that the defendant was guilty ; that he so stated, and that he was still a good deal of that opinion. Q. â€?Was that opinion to t.he effect that the defendant was guilty .of the offense ?â€?A. â€?It was.â€?Q. â€?You have expressed your opinion then?â€?A. â€?Y'es sir.â€?Q. â€?You are of the same opinion now?â€?A. â€?Yes sir.â€?Q. â€?If yon were now accepted as a juror in this case, would you take your seat in this box having that opinion still in your mind ?â€?A. â€?Well, it would be still iu my mindâ€”I could not get it out.â€?Q. â€?Would that impression be in your mind during the progress of the trial?â€?A. â€œIt would still be in my mind, sir, I could not help it.â€?Q. â€?You could not help it, and would that opinion assist in framing or inducing you to frame your verdict?â€?A. â€œIt might, sir, I could not say about that.â€?Q. â€œIt might tinge your opinion?â€?A. â€œIt might change my opinion.â€?Q. â€œAnd assist in the formation of your verdict ?â€?A. â€?It might, sir.â€?The Ã³ourt held that the juror was competent.
It will be perceived that not one of these persons testified that he believed that the impression or opinion he had formed would not influence his verdict, or that he could render an impartial verdict according to the evidence. While the juror Johnson stated that he supposed he would have to determine the case according to the evidence, and that he would have to go according to the witnesses (by all of which he evidently meant that that would be his duty), yet he testified that he had an opinion which would go with him into the jury box, which he could not get out of his mind; that he could not help it; that it might assist in forming his .verdict; and he met with silence the question whether he would go according to the witnesses. Such a person is clearly incompetent to sit as a juror. It would be grossly unfair and unjust, and against all the traditions of our race, to compel any person to go to trial before a juror in such a frame of mind. It is the object of the laws, so far as possible, to obtain impartial, unbiased, fair minded men for jurors, who can divest themselves of all previous impressions and try a case submitted to them upon its merits and decide it according to the evidence. It is clear, Â¡therefore, that he should have been held incompetent to sit as a juror.
The other jurors named were not so clearly incompetent; but they had all formed and expressed opinions as to the guilt .of the defendant, and their answers were not such as to qualify them. It is impossible to say upon their evidence that they were impartial jurors who could fairly sit in judgment upon the defendant. When persons called to sit as jurors are otherwise incompetent from actual bias, they must be required to make the declaration specified in the section -of the Code quoted. They need not make those declarations literally, but they must make them in substance; that is an absolute prerequisite ; and then if there is nothing in their further examination materially impeaching such declarations, the court may receive them as jurors, if satisfied that their opinions and impressions will not influence their verdict. These jurors did not literally nor in substance make the declarations required, and hence it was the duty of the court to hold them incompetent for actual biasâ€?
But these jurors, after the rulings of the court that they were competent to sit as jurors, were peremptorily challenged by the defendant and excluded from the panel; and hence it is claimÃ©d on the part of the people that the defendant was not harmed, and that he was thus deprived of any objection which he would otherwise have. It is however admitted in the record that before the jury was fully empaneled the defendant had exhausted all the peremptory challenges allowed him by law. He was therefore, by the erronous rulings of the trial judge, in holding these persons to be competent jurors, obliged to use his peremptory challenges, and was thus deprived of the right and power to use other peremptory challenges, in case he desired to. If after the plaintiff had used as many peremptory challenges as. he desired, he had not yet exhausted all his challenges, it could well be said that he had not been harmed. But where, by the erroneous rulings of the court, a defendant is obliged to exhaust his peremptory challenges, it is clear that he is harmed, that his rights are abridged, and that he has just cause to complain.
This homicide was committed March 11, 1883. On April 10, the defendant was indicted. On April 23, he was put upon liis trial and the jury disagreed. The case was much discussed in the public press and in the community, and there was adverse criticism of some one or more members of the jury. He was again put upon his trial on Hay 21, while the homicide and the former trial were still the subject of much criticism and conversation. Under such circumstances it can be seen that the defendantâ€™s right to challenge peremptorily, was of great value to him, and it cannot be said that rulings of the court which abridged that right were not harmful.
In the case of Burt v. Panjaud (99 U. S. 180) it was held that an error committed in overruling an objection to a juror as legally disqualified, is cured, where it appears affirmatively that he was not a member of the panel which tried the case, and it does not appear that by his exclusion therefrom the partyâ€™s right of challenge was abridged. Hilleb, J., writing the opinion of the court, said : â€œWe are of opinion that since Holmes did not sit on the jury, no harm was done to defendant. The object of both motions was to exclude him as one incompetent to sit. It is immaterial to the defendant how this was brought about. It is possible that if defendant' had shown affirmatively that he was excluded by reason of his peremptory challenge, and that in doing so the exercise of his right of peremptory challenge had been abridged, the result might be otherwise. It is sufficient to say that the record does not show that he was on the jury, but in fact that he was not, or that in getting rid of him any right of defendant was abridged or lost.
Joseph D. Dowd was also called as a juror, and upon his examination he testified that he had heard and read about the case, and this question was pnt to him, â€?Â¡Notwithstanding what you have heard and read about it, could you sit as a juror and determine this case upon the evidence?â€?and he answered, â€?Well, I should of course.â€?Upon his cross examination he testified that he had read about the case in the newspapers, and that it had made an impression upon him which still remained ; that he would bring that impression into the jury box, and that he thought it would require evidence to remove it, that he had expressed the opinion that the defendant was guilty of murder, and that he still had that opinion. The court sustained the competency of this juror, and he was sworn and served as a juror. We are of opinion that this juror was not competent. Ee was not asked to and did not declare on oath that his opinion or impression would not influence his verdict, and that he could render an impartial verdict according to the evidence, or that he could weigh the evidence impartially. Ee did not so declare in words or in substance. Unless he did so declare and could so declare, he was incompetent, and, in the absence of such a declaration he should have been excluded. â€?It is not sufficient for a juror simply to declare that he supposes he can determine the case according to the evidence, or that he would go according .to the evidence, or that his opinion as to the defendantâ€™s guilt ought not to influence his verdict, or that he supposes that he would have to go according to the witnesses. The defendant has the right to have the conscience and mind of the juror tested by a declaration under oath, not simply that he will be governed by the evidence, but by declarations which show that he believes he is in such a state of mind, so free from bias and prejudice, that he can weigh the evidence impartially, uninfluenced by any opinion or impression which he has formed. As said in Bacons Abridgment (Juries E, 5), â€œAn honest but weak man may be so much biased as to think he goes by the evidence when his affections add weight to the evidence.â€?Indifferency is one of the common-law characteristics of a jury, and it is inviolably secured by the constitutional guaranty of jury trial. A party put upon trial for a crime has a constitutional right by a challenge, or in some other mode to protect himself against a biased jury.
Other exceptions taken during the trial to rulings upon questions of evidence, and relating to the charge of the judge, have been brought to our attention. But we do not regard them as important, and they need not now be considered.
The judgment of the General Term and of the Oyer and Terminer should be reversed and a new trial granted.

1167715,PEOPLE v. HOOGHKERK,1884-06,"Andrews, J.
The indictment against-the defendant Hooghkerk, was found at the court of sessions, Albany county, at the September term, 1883, by a grand .jury selected in pursuance of chapter 533, Laws of 1881. Before the jury was sworn or impaneled, the defendant, who, priorato the commencement of the term, had been committed to answer to any indictment that might be found against him thereat, filed in open court a written protest or objection, under oath, against the swearing, organization or recognition by the court of the persons summoned as grand jurors, or of any of them as a grand jury, on the ground that they were not drawn or summoned as required by law. The same facts in support of the objection were presented as in the Petrea case (92 N. Y. 128.) The question is the same as was considered and determined in that case, except as it is affected by the consideration that in this case the objection was raised before indictment, and before the grand jury had been organized.
In the Petrea case it was held that upon the facts proved and offered to be proved, the act of 1881 was unconstitutional, in so far as it provided for the selection of grand jurors for Albany county, for the reason that it was a local bill for the selection of grand jurors, and as such within the prohibition of article iil, section 18, of the state constitution which prohibits the passage of a local bill for â€?selecting, etc., or impaneling grand or petit jurors.â€?But the court further decided that a defendant might nevertheless be lawfully put upon his trial upon an indictment found by a grand jury selected under the act; that no constitutional right of the defendant was thereby invaded; that the right of the defendant to raise the objection was a matter of procedure, subject to the control of the legislature ; and that the objection was not one which, by the new procedure in criminal cases, could be taken by a defendant after indictment.
The only question now open on this appeal; upon this branch of the case, is whether, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, a defendant held to answer a criminal charge, may, on the return of the grand jury list, and before indictment, take the objection which, under the decision in the Petrea case, lie would be precluded from taking after indictment. If the case permits this discrimination, the objection must prevail, otherwise the case is governed by our former decision. By section 238, a challenge to the panel or any of the grand jurors is prohibited, but the section authorizes the court in its discretion to discharge the panel for causes specified, and among others â€?that the requisite number of ballots was-not drawn from the grand jury box of the county.â€?Section 239 authorizes a challenge to be interposed to an individual grand juror for certain specified causes. Taking the two sections together, it seems to be quite evident that section 238 was intended to confer upon the court a discretionary power to discharge the panel to be exercised upon its own volition, and in view of all the circumstances, while section 239 was intended to secure to an accused person, the right to purge the panel of one or more particular grand jurors who might be objectionable, for bias, or other specified cause.
The power conferred by section 238 is in the general interest of public justice; that conferred- by section 239 is in the particular and special interest of the person accused. The objection interposed to .the panel in this case on behalf of the defendant was in the nature of a challenge to the array, and the right of a defendant to challenge the body of the grand jury because irregularly or defectively constituted, no longer exists, and we find no provision of law permitting a defendant to raise any objection to the grand jury, except an objection to individual jurors under section 239. We think the objection of the defendant to the grand jury was properly overruled. It may not be out of place, however, to express the opinion that the court, except for the fact that the grand jury which found-the indictment in this case, although selected and organized after the decision in the Petrea case was selected before the board of supervisors had an opportunity to prepare a grand jury list in conformity with the general law, might very properly on its own motion have discharged the panel.
It is very unseemly that grand juries should continue to be selected under the act of 1880, after that law has been declared unconstitutional, and the omission of the board of supervisors to perform the plain duty of preparing a proper grand jury list ought not to be longer tolerated.
The other questions arise upon exceptions taken on the trial. The principal one is an exception on behalf of the prisoner to the refusal of the court to charge that there was no evidence tending to corroborate the testimony of the witnesses Jones and Nugent, who concededly by their own confession, were accomplices of the defendant in the commission of the crime charged in the indictment. The general facts relating to the alleged crime, as testified to by the accomplices, are that on and prior to January 2, 1883, Jones was lessee of a stable- in the,city of Albany and had procured an insurance of Â§500 on horses and property therein, which at the suggestion of Hooghkerk he increased to $1,000, with the understanding that Nugent was to fire the barn, for which he was to receive $100, and that the insurance money should be divided between Jones and Hooghkerk. It was a part of the arrangement that Hooghkerk should buy some cheap horses to be put in the stable in place of other more valuable horses to be removed before the fire.. The fire occurred Tuesday, January 2, 1883, at about 12:50 a. m. Monday or Tuesday evening before the fire Hooghkerk, as Nugent testifies, brought two cheap horses to a point near the stable, and then exchanged them for two other horses belonging to Hooghkerk, which Nugent and one Streveli, by the direction of Jones, had taken from the stable, and the horses received from Hooghkerk were taken back to the stable and were burned in the fire. One or two other cheap horses were, as the accomplices testify, also purchased by Hooghkerk shortly before the fire and placed in the stable. It is not claimed that Hooghkerk either set the fire or was present when it was set. The evidence is that it was set by Nugent, who admitted the fact.
The evidence contained in the record goes into great detail, but it is unnecessary for the present purpose to refer more particularly to the evidence of the accomplices. It is sufficient to state that if their testimony is true, there can be no question of the guilt of the defendant. On the other hand, if their testimony is excluded from the case, it is not probable that he could have been convicted, although circumstances would remain calculated to excite grave suspicion. Christopher Ferns testified he sold a horse to Hooghkerk in December before the fire for $15, and delivered it within a few days,'and Hooghkerk testified that it was delivered New Yearsâ€?night. John Ernzart testified to the sale of a horse to Hooghkerk two or three days before New Years for $15, and to its delivery either Sunday or Monday night before the fire. George Brown testified to a like sale a few days before New Years for $10, and that the horse was delivered to Hooghkerk on Sunday or Monday night before the fire. John Feizenbaum testified that the defendant, Hooghkerk, about January 1, 1885, in the evening, brought to his place about a mile and a half from Albany, two bay horses, with collars and blankets, and left them with him a few days and then took them away. John Streveli testified he worked for Jones at the time of the fire ; that on Monday evening, the night of the fire, he went to the stable and found Jones and Hooghkerk there; that Jones' brought out two bay horses and askpd' him to go and help Nugent exchange them ; that they went with them to Washington avenue (about a block distant from the stable) and met Hooghkerk there in a carriage, with two other horses, which were exchanged for the bay horses, which Hooghkerk took away, and that the witness and Nugent took the two horses received from him to the stable that he asked Jones what he was doing * that Jones said, â€œif I (Strevell) would keep still he would-give me $50,â€?and further, â€?I did not want his $50, or know anything about his business, and I went home.â€?Nugent testified that when he saw Strevell coming, Jones was throwing the straw around the barn floor; that he told Jones that Strevell was coming, and â€?Jones catehed the lamp and blew-it outthat Jones said to Strevell, â€?Yon keep still, and I will give you $50 and a suit of clothes;â€?that Strevell said â€œhe didnâ€™t want no $50, and didnâ€™t want to know nothing of his business.â€?It further appeared that the property in the barn was insured for $1,000. The policy was put in evidence, and it was proved that the insurance company paid the loss. Hooghkerk testified'that the policy at one time was in his possession, but that it was given to him after the fire to secure a loan, and that Jones on some pretense, obtained it from him, and that he received no part of the insurance money.
The statute (Code Criminal Proc. Â§ 399) declares that â€?a conviction cannot be had upon â–? the testimony of an accomplice unless he is corroborated by such other evidence as leads to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime,â€?and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the crime or the circumstances thereof. Prior to the statute the rule in this state permitted the jury to convict a defendant upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice (People v. Costello, 1 Den. 83), but it was the uniform custom of judges to advise the jury that the evidence of the accomplice should be received with great caution, and it rarely happened that a conviction was had upon his unsupported evidence. The rule now embodied in the statute is substantially the rule which, before the statute, courts were in the habit of stating to the jury for their guidance, although, as has been said, it was not enforced as a rule of law. It is plain that independently of the statutory rule, corroborative evidence to have any value must be evidence from an independent source of some material fact tending to show not only that the crime had been committed, but that the defendant was implicated in it, and such is the doctrine of the best considered cases. But neither the doctrine hitherto declared by the courts, nor the rule embodied in the statute requires that the whole case should be proved outside of the testimony of the accomplice. Such a rule would render the testimony of an accomplice in most cases unnecessary and would defeat the policy of the law which permits the use of accomplices as witnesses in aid of, and in the interest of public justice.
We think there was evidence in this case tending to connect the defendant with the commission of crime charged against him, independently of the testimony of Jones and Mugent. The evidence of Strevell as to what took place at the barn in connection with the subsequent fire, leads to an inference of an incendiary burning. Indeed, this is the only reasonable inference from the conduct of Jones in attempting to bribe Strevell to keep silence, interpreted in connection with the mysterious exchange of horses, the fire and the insurance. The connection of Hooghkerk with the felony is not directly shown by testimony independent of the accomplices. But he is shown by Strevell to have been in the immediate vicinity of the stable shortly before the fire, engaged in the exchange of horses under suspicious circumstances. The fact that he purchased cheap horses, which were delivered to him on Sunday or Monday evening is established by the testimony of independent witnesses, and is indeed admitted by Hooghkerk, and the jury may well have discredited his explanation of these transactions. The testimony of Feizenbaum that Hooghkerk brought the bay horses to his place on the night of the fire, or about that time, confirms Strevell in part of his story, and closely connects Hooghkerk with the transactions of the night of the fire. It cannot, we think, be doubted that the circumstances proved outside of the testimony of the accomplices show such a relation between Jones and the defendant, and such a sequence of events as to justify the inference not only that the crime of arson was committed, but that Hooghkerk was accessory to it. The claim that Strevell was himself an accomplice, was properly left to the jury. The transactions he testifies to may have aroused, and probably did arouse, his suspicions, but it is quite evident that he was not an original party to the scheme for burning the barn, and it was for the jury to determine whether, when the transactions testified to occurred, he had any guilty knowledge of the impending crime.
The declaration of Jones to Nugent in the absence of Hooghkerk, to the effect that the latter was engaged â€?in the business of burning barns,â€?was coupled with the further declaration that he told Hooghkerk â€?what Jones said.â€?The court replied to the motion to strike out this evidence by saying, â€?I will retain it for the present. Tour motion is good unless it is connected in some way.â€?There was no subsequent motion made by the defendant in respect to this evidence. When the motion was made, it appeared,that the remark of Jones was communicated by Nugent to the defendant, and the exception to the disposition of the motion at that time was not well taken.
The questions put to Hooghkerk in his cross-examination with reference to his connection with other fires and with insurance on other property burned, were admissible in the discretion of the court, as affecting his credibility, within the cases (People v. Casey, 72 N. Y. 393; People v. Noelke, 94 Id. 137; People v. Irving, 2 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 47).
There are no other questions requiring notice. We find no error in the record, and the judgment should therefore be be affirmed.

1167727,PEOPLE v. BAKER,1884-06,"Earl, J.
The defendant was tried and convicted in the Eensselaer County Sessions for obtaining of William H. Meeker, on March 30, 1876, the sum of $575 by false pretenses. The conviction was affirmed at the General Term of the Supreme Court, and then he appealed to this court. The facts of the case may be summarized as follows: In and prior to March, 1873, Meeker was a Methodist minister and the defendant was a reputable citizen of Schaghticoke, a merchant of considerable means, reputed to be wealthy and in business affairs skillful and sagacious. They were intimate friends, and there existed intimate social relations between their families. Meeker became aware that the defendant dealt somewhat in stocks, and that he had been successful in making in that way some money for himself and others; and having about ten thousand dollars invested in small sums in various ways, he conceived the idea of operating in stocks through the defendant, mainly for a more profitable and less troublesome investment of his means. The.defendant consented to act for him as his friend, and without compensation. It was finally agreed that the defendant was, through his brÃ³kers, to buy for Meeker, one hundred shares of New York Central Railroad stock, upon a margin of $2,000, and carry the stock through his brokers for him until he could pay for the same. - After the payment of the first $2,000, as fast as Meeker could gather in his money, he was to pay it to the defendant, and he was to pay it to the brokers, or use it in his business, allowing interest on the same, or in speculating in other stocks for Meeker, the profits of which were ultimately to be used in paying for the New York Central stock, which Meeker desired to hold as an investment. On March 28, 1873, the defendant wrote Meeker a letter which acknowledged the receipt of a sum of money to be used as a margin for the purchase of the stock, and after giving some facts and opinions about stocks, closed as follows : â€?I have given yon the facts for you to decide and let me know your decision. You cannot make much mistake in the stocks I have mentioned. You can have the benefit (if any) of my experience; but do not forget that all human judgments are fallible, and I may be mistaken in my opinions. You should inform yourself as soon as possible. My opinion is there will be a large advance in all R. R. stocks except such as have been inflated.â€?To this letter Meeker replied the next day, speaking of his resources and his efforts to get in his money, desiring to know how long he could carry the one hundred shares of stock upon payment by him of $2,000, expressing a wish that some of his money might be used to speculate in Lake Shore, and in Wabash stocks, and saying among other things, â€?as you are disposed to help me a little, I wish you to practice that great rule, do by me as you do for yourself, and I will take the results.â€?â€œYou understand now my resources and wishes, I think, and if you think it is best for me or for yourself to venture my $4,000, in this way, then let drive and I will send moneys to you as fast as they come, and pay you interest on any moneys you use of your own for my benefit.â€?â€?Not that I care about speculating, but I would like to have as' much lawful interest in the way of dividends as my neighbors have,â€?â€œall of which I leave now to your judgment.â€?On April 9, before the defendant had received the full sum of $2,000, he purchased through his brokers the one hundred shares of New York Central stock at a total cost of a little over $10,000, and reported the purchase by letter to Meeker. They met soon after, and had a conversation in which the defendant told him that he need not hurry up his collections, or incommode himself, as the stock had been purchased. After that they did not meet for about a year and a half, and their business was transacted by correspondence. Meeker from time to time sent him more money,- suggesting in some of his letters that he should use his money in speculating in Western stocks so as to make money to aid in paying for the Mew York Central stock. The defendant in the letters he wrote acknowledged the receipt of money, gave -his opinion about stocks and sent statements of the account between them. The defendant was to carry along the stock in this way until, by the mobey sent him by Meeker and the dividends on the stock, it was paid for, and then, and not until then, Meeker was to have the stock certificate.
Unfortunately for both parties, in the Autumn of 1873 the great financial panic -occurred, which caused great stringency in money, and .great depreciation in the price of stocks; and on March 11, 1874, after he had received of Meeker, including the dividends credited, about $5,000, pressed by his financial necessities, without the knowledge or consent of Meeker, he sold the stock. After -that, Meeker continued to send him money from time to time to apply upon the stocks, and he continued to acknowledge the receipt of the money so sent, and to send statements -to Meeker showing credits for the money and for dividends as if made upon stock actually held by him. In a letter to Meeker dated March 12, 1875, he advised him not to sell -the. stocks until times were better, and said that he would carry it just as long .as he wished; and in a letter dated March 15, he said : â€œYou will certainly do well not to sell until times .are better, for then you will get a higher price.â€?They met .in the Autumn of 1875 and had some conversation about the stock and the account, in which Meeker proposed thereafter1 to pay his money directly to the brokers instead -of the defendant, but it was suggested by the defendant that as he had .charge of the matter and there was some discrepancy between him and the brokers about the account, he should continue to make his payments to him. On January 12, 1876, the defendant wrote him a letter giving him a statement of his credits for dividends, upon the stock, besides credits for several payments of money. He closed the letter in language not uncommon with deluded and sanguine dealers in stocks by saying: â€?I think stocks have about reached their lowest prices. The market is very buoyant. There will be a prodigious advance in them before long. Bottom has been touched.â€?Thereafter, without any further meeting or communication between them, on March 30, Meeker sent him $575, for which he gave a receipt, and that is the sum which he is charged with obtaining by the false pretenses. Afterward Meeker continued to send the defendant money which the defendant continued to acknowledge, and this course of business continued until April 13, 1877, when the defendant gave Meeker a receipt for a small sum, which was stated to be in full payment for the one hundred shares of stock. The correspondence between the parties which continued down into the year 1879, shows that the defendant was financially embarrassed, but that he was hopefully struggling against the adverse tide, and waiting for a favorable turn in the stock market. In the end he became insolvent, and all his property, and all Meeker had paid him, seem to have passed into the Wall Street maelstrom, where so many fortunes of sanguine and confiding speculators have been engulfed.
It must be noticed that not a word passed between Meeker and the defendant, personally, from the Fall of 1875 until long after the payment of-the $575.
The defendant at no time asked Meeker to pay that or any other sum, and the only false representations upon which the people rely are those contained in the statements made in the accounts sent to Meeker by the defendant on and prior to January 12,1878.
We have thus given an outline of all the evidence tending to establish the crime of which the defendant was convicted. A careful examination and consideration of all the facts, has left upon our minds a strong conviction that the defendant was not guilty. He ought not to have sold the stock without Meekerâ€™s consent; but in doing so he was at most guilty of its conversion. After he had sold it, he ought to have informed Meeker of the sale, so that he could have withheld further payments, or, at his option, continued the payments relying upon the ability of the defendant to furnish the stock when it should be paid for. But for withholding this information he was not guilty of any crime. He ought not to have used language in his letters and statements sent to Meeker, substantially conveying information that he was still carrying the stock. So far as his letters and statements convey that information they were undoubtedly false ; but a mere false statement is not punishable as a crime. It is not claimed that the defendant, at the time of the original arrangement with Meeker to i-eceive his money for the purchase of the stock, had then formed any plan or intention to defraud or swindle. It is entirely clear upon the evidence that he intended them, in good faith to aid Meeker to make money by operating in stocks, and to procure for him a profitable and safe investment. Having been somewhat successful in stock operations, he was sanguine that his good fortune would continue and that his sagacity would enable him to aid Meeker. There is not a particle of evidence which justifies the inference that when he sold the stock he meant to defraud Meeker. At that time, so far as the evidence tends to show, he had abundant property left after the sale to respond to any claim of Meeker. There is no reason to doubt that he made the sale of the stock to relieve himself from what he then believed to be a temporary embarrassment, expecting to be able to replace the stock, and in any event to deliver it whenever Meeker should pay for it. It is not a just inference from the evidence that when, on January 12, 1876, more than two months before the $575 was paid, the defendant entered into an account then rendered to Meeker, credits for dividends paid upon the stock as if he were still holding the stock for him, he made such entries for the purpose of inducing Meeker to make further payments. As between himself and Meeker, the latter was entitled to such credits, and it was simply a mode of stating the account between him and Meeker, as an account would have to be stated whenever the stock should be fully paid for and the time should come for its delivery. Those statements in the account were not made to induce any payment or any action on the part of Meeker. He at no time
pressed Meeker for payments or asked him to make payments, and whatever payments were made by Meeker at any time were voluntarily made. It is not a just inference from the evidence that on January 12, or at any time before the Â§575 was paid, the defendant had conceived any design to swindle or defraud Meeker. He was evidently confident and sanguine that a turn in the stock market would bring him out all right, and enable him to perform his entire obligation to Meeker in reference to the stock.
In order to constitute the crime of obtaining property by false pretenses, it is not sufficient to prove the false pretenses, and that property was obtained thereby ; but it- must be proved that the false pretenses were made with intent to cheat and defraud another. Here there was an entire failure to prove that necessary element of the crime. It is impossible to say that the statements as to the dividends, in the letter of January, 1876, were made to induce the payment of the $575, or to induce any further payments. The defendant undoubtedly wished Meeker to understand that he was still carrying the stock, not for the purpose of inducing him to make further payments, but undoubtedly so that Meeker should not complain of, charge him with, or hold him for the conversion of his stock. Another essential element of the crime which the people in all cases of this kind are bound to establish, is that the money was paid, or the property parted with in reliance upon and under the inducement of the false pretenses alleged. Here it is not a just inference from the evidence that this $575 was paid in reliance upon the representation that the defendant was still holding and carrying the stock. At that time Meeker had implicit confidence in the financial ability, the business sagacity and the personal integrity of the defendant. For aught that appears in the evidence, he would have continued his payments relying upon the defendant to deliver the stock when it had been fully paid for, if he had known, that to tide over a present necessity, he had sold the stock. And so, when Meeker was asked the direct question, he testified that he relied entirely upon the promise of the defendant that he would purchase the stock and deliver it to him after he had fully paid for it, and that his promise to deliver the stock was the only thing he relied upon. He did not testify, as he could if it had been true,â€?that he relied upon the representations of the defendant that he still continued to carry the stock. It must be borne in mind that mere silence and mere suppression of the truth â€”the mere withholding of knowledge upon which another may actâ€”is not sufficient to constitute the crime of false pretenses.
We do not sit here to square the conduct of the defendant by any code of morality, or any standard of integrity ; the sole question is whether the proof was sufficient to show that he had committed the crime with which he stood charged, and we are of the opinion that it utterly failed.
It does not relieve ns from our responsibility that the jury have found the defendant guilty. The point was taken at the trial on his behalf, that there was not evidence sufficient to establish the crime, and that he should be discharged on that account; and that makes it our duty to determine whether the evidence was sufficient, and finding that it -was insufficient, it is our duty to reverse the judgment entered upon the verdict of the jury.
But if so far wrong, and the case was one for the jury, errors were committed at the trial, of which the defendant can justly complain. Against his objection, the people were permitted to show payments of money by Meeker to him from time to time, before and after the payment of the $575.- Proof of such payment was made for the purpose of showing the guilty intention of the defendant, and was competent only for that purpose. The defendant, as a witness in his own behalf, was permitted to testify that he did not, at the time he received the $575, intend to defraud Meeeker. He was also asked this question : â€?Was your intention, when you received moneys from time to time from Meeker to defraud him ?â€?That was objected to as incompetent and inadmissible, and the objection was sustained. As the intent with which those moneys were received was one of the material inquiries he should have been permitted to show that he did not receive it with any fraudulent intent. The case went to the jury in such a way as to enable the people to claim, that not only the $575, was received by the defendant with the intent to defraud Meeker but that all the other moneys were received in the same way, and that the receipt of all the moneys liad a tendency to show with what intent the $575 was received ; and hence the defendant clearly had the right to show that he had no fraudulent intent in receiving any of it.
The defendant, after answering that at the time he received the $575, he did not intend to defraud Meeker, was also asked to state his intention at the time he received it, and the question was objected to on the part of the people and the objection was sustained. We think that ruling was also erroneous. Upon the facts of the case as they were developed at the trial, it was claimed by the defendant that when ho received the $575, it was his intention to replace the stock, to respond to Meeker whenever called upon for the stock, and that he was at the time able to do so. That was a theory he had a right to prove if he could,, and the proof would bear upon the final issue, whether he intended to cheat and defraud him; and hence he should have been permitted to answer the question.
The judge charged the' jury as follows : â€?If you find that the defendant made the representations charged in the indictment, and that they were false, and that the defendant knew they were false when he made them, then the law presumes the fraudulent intent.â€?That portion of the charge was excepted to by the defendant, and we think the exception well founded. The crime of false pretenses is not made out by simply showing that the representations charged in the indictment were made, and that they were false, and that the defendant knew them to be false. The jury, from those facts and from all the other facts, may infer a fraudulent intent; but the law does not presume a fraudulent intent. That is to be found as a fact by the jury, and is not an inference of law.
The indictment alleged that Baker did purchase this stock on April 9, 1873. The people, against the objection of the defendant, gave some evidence on the trial tending to show that the defendant never had the stock; and his counsel requested the judge to charge that under the indictment the jury must find that Baker had the stock April 9,1873 ; and the judge declined. That should have been charged. It was so alleged in the indictment, and the people could not take any benefit from any proof tending to show the contrary.
We are therefore of opinion that the defendant was improperly convicted, and that the judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered.

1167696,PEOPLE v. JEFFERSON,1884-06,"Ruger, Ch. J.
The defendant was convicted in the court of Sessions of the County of Kings of the crime of murder in the first degree, for the killing of one Henry Hicks, on December 21 1882. He now seeks to reverse that conviction for certain errors alleged to have been committed upon his trial, and which it is claimed operated to his prejudice before the jury.
It is not denied that Hicks met his death at the hands of the defendant, or that the homicide occurred while the defendant was engaged in the commission of a felony, but it is claimed that the killing was unpremeditated and the defendant not of sound mind when he discharged the gun by which the killing of Hicks was effected.
There was some evidence tending to show the existence of an unsound mind on the part of the defendant at the time of the commission of the crime, but it was of a slight and inconclusive character.
The question as to the defendantâ€™s sanity was left by the trial court to the jury to determine as a question of fact upon the evidence and under a charge which was quite as favorable to the defendant as the rules of law permit, and we feel no disposition to criticise the conclusion reached by that tribunal upon the question.
It was such, we think, as would be reached by any intelligent mind after a consideration of the evidence appearing in the record, and leaves no room to doubt the justice of the verdict.
No exceptions were taken on the trial to the instructions given by the court to the jury, arid the charge upon the material points was more favorable to the prisoner than was even called for by the defendantâ€™s requests.
The only exception urged by the defendantâ€™s counsel upon this appeal, is that taken to the ruling of the court upon the admission in evidence of certain papers found on the person of the defendant when he was arrested two days after the commission of the homicide. One of these papers was apparently, signed by the defendant, and they all appeared to be monologues written by the defendant and purporting to contain a record of the thoughts, feelings and motives operating upon his mind to induce the commission of the contemplated crime. No ground of objection was stated by the prisonerâ€™s counsel to the admission of the papers in evidence, and the only ground now urged in support of the objection is the want of identification of the papers offered, and the immateriality and irrelevancy to the offense charged in the indictment of certain portions of the statements contained in the writing.
The proof showed that these papers in question were found upon the person of the defendant when he was arrested, and his frequent declaration to the effect that he wrote them for the purpose of having them found there in the event of his being arrested for the crime. The evidence of identification seems abundant.
The court in its charge to the jury carefully excluded from their consideration, all such parts of the papers referred to as did not-tend to indicate an intention on the part of the defendant to kill Celestial Jefferson at the time of the commission of the homicide charged in the indictment.
No request was made by the prisonerâ€™s counsel of the court to charge in respect to the papers, and no exception taken to any part of his charge, in relation thereto.
After a careful examination of the evidence in the case, we are of the opinion that no error was committed by the court on the trial,- and that the defendant has been fairly and impartially tried and convicted of the crime charged in the indictment.
The evidence clearly shows that a feeling of hostility toAvards the immates of the house where the homicide Avas committed, and particularly against his brother, had been entertained by the defendant for a number of days prior to its commission, and preparation on his part of the means for the accomplishment of the act had been made at least several days before its final execution. For several days previous to the homicide the defendant had made threats, indicating an intention to inflict personal injury upon the immates of the house where his brother and the deceased Hicks resided. While no motive can ever seem to the rational mind sufficient to induce the commission of the crime of murder, yet a motive such as that which existed in this case, viz.: a feeling of revenge against a person for having, as he supposed, supplanted him in the favor of one who had formerly occupied to him the relations of a mistress, has frequently operated as a sufficient motive to persons of ill regulated passions and ungovernable temper for the killing of a rival.
Two lives were here sacrificed to the spirit of jealousy and revenge which animated an apparently ignorant and depraved man, and those passions in the light of all experience must be deemed the motives influencing the defendant in the commisaion of this crime.
The demands of justice, and the protection of society, seem clearly to require in this case that the penalties provided by the law for the punishment of the crime of murder should be imposed upon the defendant.
The judgment of the court below should be affirmed.

1167730,PEOPLE v. CONROY,1884-06,"Barrett, J.
Conroy was convicted of murder in the first degree, upon an indictment charging him with the killing of one Keenan. The indictment is under the first subdivision of section 183 of the Penal Code; and it avers that the killing was from a deliberate and premeditated design to effect the death of Keenan.
We have gone over the evidence with care, and we are of opinion that the element of deliberation is entirely wanting. The learned judge should, as requested, have withdrawn the question of murder in the first degree from the consideration of the jury. His instructions upon the law of the two degrees of murder were entirely accurate. But he failed to apply the facts to his definitions, and consequently the jury fell into the quite natural error of treating the many brutal and atrocious features of this homicide as the equivalant of legal evidence of deliberation. We find enough to warrant the submission to the jury of the question of murder in the second degree ; that is, of killing with the design to effect the death of Keenan or of some other person, but without deliberation and premeditation. Enough, too, if the indictment had been framed under the second subdivision of section 183, and had charged the killing by an act imminently dangerous to others, and evincing a depraved mind regardless of human life, although without premeditation, to have justified the submission of murder in the first degree. But for the evidence of deliberation', we have sought in vain. Upon the contrary, the strongest testimony against Conroy points no farther than to sudden impulse. Between the impulse and the act there was no reflection, however slight or brief. There were, in fact, none of the indicia of deliberate purpose ; no hesitation, no doubt overcome, no choice made as the result of thought. Indeed, the gravest question was, whether the shot was fired with any distinct and specific intent, or merely with a reckless and wanton disregard of human life.
Conroyâ€™s acts throughout were those of a ferocious ruffian inflamed by drink; but the law expressly declares that voluntary intoxication, though furnishing no excuse for a criminal act, may be considered by the jury upon the questions of intent and of the degree of crime (Penal Code, Â§ 22). If voluntary intoxication may be considered upon the question of intent, a fortiori upon that of deliberation. The defense of insanity in our judgment entirely failed and was properly overruled by the jury. Undoubtedly Conroy was responsible ""for his acts in every legal sense. But the evidence upon that head, while failing to establish irresponsibility, indicated an abnormal sensitiveness to liquor, resulting from sunstroke, a fall from a loft and other incidents, fully accounting for the extraordinary mental disturbance caused by two glasses of bar-room sherry. An exhibition of violence followed each dram, and followed it almost instantly. Nothing of the kind preceded the drinking. Certainly Conroy had no homicidal intent when he entered Codyâ€™s saloon. That event was purely casual. He happened to be passing, and he was invited in to drink. He then seemed to be sober. The people within were either his friends, ordinary acquaintances, or persons with whom he was entirely unacquainted. At all events, he found no enemy there. After taking Ã¡ glass of what was called sherry wine, he became quarrelsome, accused a man named Cantwell of having previously betrayed his improper presence in a drinking saloon while on duty, and upon Contwellâ€™s retorting, offered to fight. In a few moments, he seemed to get entirely over this combative spirit,' became, as one of the witnesses described it â€?happy,â€?and invited all present to drink at his expense. Again he took a glass of the so-called sherry wine, again he became quarrelsome. At first he questioned the price of the drinks. Then Cody, to pacify him, reduced the charge from one dollar to seventy cents. Still he seemed dissatisfied, inquiring of several about him if they had drunk. .He then asked a man named McGuinness what he had taken, and upon McGuinness replying â€œmixed ale,â€?Conroy called him a liar. McGuinness retorted, â€?.You are another,â€?and thereupon Conroy struck him with his fist, knocking him down ; and while McGuinness was down kicked-him about the hips. This raised a tumult. The crowd â€?hallooed â€?. at Conroy to let McGuinness up, and began to close in around him. Conroy then drew his club, and the crowd retreated to a card-room in the rear. As they retreated Conroy also drew his revolver, holding the club in one hand, the revolver in the other.' Some one then put his head out of the card-room door and Conroy threw his club at him, missing the manâ€™s head, but smashing a pane of glass in the door. Almost immediately another pane of glass was broken from the inside of the card-room. This evidently startled Conroy and precipitated the firing, for instantly he â€?wheeled to his left â€?with his face still towards the card-room door, and as a friend (Keating), who undoubtedly perceived that' danger was imminent, grasped him by the shoulder, the revolver, to use the language of the witness Buckley, â€?at that instant went off.â€?This description is slightly varied by one of the witnesses, who says that Conroy, after breaking the pane of glass, stepped back two or three paces, placed his club in his belt, threw open his coat, and with some difficulty, got at and drew his revolver; that, as he did so, Keating exclaimed, â€œFor Godâ€™s sake, Billy, donâ€™t fire ; those are friends of mine;â€?and that, notwithstanding this warning, Conroy, according to the witness Cantwell, â€?turned round and let go that way quick as lightning.â€?In all this there was surely not the slightest indication of a deliberate purpose. Conroy had had no quarrel of any kind with the unfortunate man who received the bullet. In fact, he scarcely knew this man. Even the dispute with Cantwell had been composed.
McGuinncss had fled and was not in the saloon. Conroy was then his own worst and only enemy.
It is palpable either that he fired without mental concentration upon any individual object, but recklessly and in utter disregard of human life (for which offense as we have seen he has not been indicted), or that fearing an attack he acted upon a sudden impulse to strike terror into the crowd by firing at the first person who stood before or about him. The extreme rapidity of Conroyâ€™s movements, the absence of threats, pre-existing ill-will or motive; the presence of self-aroused passion and sudden violence; the inappreciable space of time between the act and the earliest previous moment when it is possible to assume the flash of design ; the unreasoning, senseless and frenzied condition of his mind ; all tend absolutely to exclude the idea of deliberation, even within the most extreme construction which, in the interests of society, has been or can be given to this word in its present statutory relation.
The law must not be nullified, strained or perverted to meet an exceptional case nor to make an example of a particular offender.
In all the cases to which we have been referred, there was undoubted evidence of a deliberate purpose. They differ in every essential particular from the present.
In Hoveyâ€™s case (29 Hun, 382; 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 180), the evidence of deliberation consisted of the purchase and loading of the pistol, followed directly by its use in the commission of the deed.
In Sindramâ€™s case (88 N. Y. 196), it consisted of previous bad blood and threats, followed by preparation, the prisonerâ€™s seeking the deceased, and the deliberate firing of a second shot after the failure of the first.
In Majoneâ€™s case (91 N. Y. 211; 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 94), it consisted in the exhaustion of any possible-impulse upon the previous killing of his wife, and his proceeding with the same â€?weapon from the room where his first victim lay, directly to the deceased.
In Cornettiâ€™s case (92 N. Y. 85; 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 303), it consisted in the prisonerâ€™s taking advantage of an opportunity to secure the knife with which the crime was perpetrated, and, in shortly afterwards, without a word, approaching the deceased and stabbing him to death.
In Leightonâ€™s case (10 Abb. N. C. 261), it consisted of previous threats to injure the deceased, Mary Dean; of the prisoner seeking her out, with the razor in his pocket; and of an all-potent motiveâ€”jealousy, and her abandonment of him for another man.
The distinction between these cases and the present is marked and obvious. It is the distinction between premeditation and-impulseâ€”between the cold-blooded or deliberate assassin and the brutal or reckless bar-room brawler.
The Legislature has chosen to make this distinction. It has enacted that the one offender shall suffer death, the other imprisonment for life. Courts and juries must not be wiser than the law. It is sufficient that it is the law, and it should be enforced loyally and with submission to the legislative wiM.
We have not been unmindful of what transpired after the homicideâ€”the prisonerâ€™s wanton shooting in the street, his stupid lying to his brother officers, his outrageous behavior to the deceased, and his declaration to Sergeant Cassidy that he â€?tried hard enough to shoot Keenan.â€?All this, however, has a more important bearing upon Conroyâ€™s mental condition as affected by the two glasses of sherry than upon the question of deliberation. In truth it is almost inconceivable that a man capable of a deliberate murder and conscious of having committed it, should have closed the door to all hope by clubbing his dying victim, shooting at other innocent people and avoiding anything like plausibility in the preposterous falsehoods which were put forward to account for what had happenedâ€”falsehoods which anyone capable of even the lowest order of reflection would have seen must be instantly and completely exploded by every witness of the occurrence.
As to Conroyâ€™s statement, so earnestly dxvelt upon by the learned District Attorney, that he â€?tried hard enough to shoot Keenan,â€?it is impossible to give it to the force of a confession of deliberate purpose.
At the titmost and treated literally the words convey nothing beyond an intent to kill, formed at the moment.
They do not necessarily import deliberation ; and thus they really add nothing to the actual occurrence as narrated by the witnesses. If in fact the whole scene, as thus laid doxvn before ns, excludes the responsibility of deliberation, the value of such a retrospect is limited to its bearing upon the question of murder in the second degree. But ""in truth Conroy thereby intended not to confess his guilt, but blatantly to protest his innocence and to boast of his prowess. This is apparent from Sergeant Cassidyâ€™s testimony. We quote :
Q. What did he tell you %
A. .He told me that he had arrested this man for being drunk and disorderly.
Q. Arrested Keenan ?
A. Keenan for being drunk, and disorderly; he was attacked by a crowd there_ and his prisoner rescued; I says, â€?Conroy, is this man shot ?â€?â€?Well,â€?he says, â€?I donâ€™t knoxv, if he is or not,â€?he says, â€?it is not my fault: I tried hard enough to shoot him.â€?Under the circumstances, to treat this expression as evidence of deliberation would require not only the straining of language, but its entire misapplicationâ€”that is, its transposition from the imaginary scene it was intended to color to the real occurrence xvhich it sought to conceal; and then ascribing to it as thus grafted, the sincerity and truth which it originally lacked. Hard cases sometimes produce bad logic as well as bad laxv. If the res gestos had supported the claim of deliberation with something less insignificant than a xvant of ease in drawing the revolver and the failure almost at the moment of the shooting to heed a bystanderâ€™s exclamation, we would probably never have heard of this subsequent straw.
The truth is, that it was simply an idle phrase, meant to be cunning but really transparent, put forward to color the equally idle falsehood that he had arrested Keenan for being drunk and disorderly; and that he had then been attacked by a mob in the street and his prisoner rescued. What he meant in his besotted way, to convey to Sergeant Cassidy was that he had shot Keenan in the faithful performance of the duty which devolved upon him to prevent, by every means in his power, the escape of a rescued prisoner. Plainly this and nothing more.
Whether, then, this shocking affair be regarded in the light of what transpired after, before or at the time of the shooting, the absence of deliberation is-equally apparent.
The result is inevitable. Under the law as it existed prior to 1873, Conroy would have forfeited his life.
There was then but one degree of murder, and to constitute it, premeditation alone was required. The courts had construed the law so that premeditation and, intent were substantially equivalent. The Legislature then divided the crime into two degrees, requiring intent with deliberation and premeditation to constitute the first; intent without deliberation and premeditation to constitute the second. Conroyâ€™s case, therefore, comes clearly with the second and not within the first of these degrees. But the error below was not unnatural. For if ever there was a case where the judgment of a right-minded court, prosecuting officer or jury might readily be obscured by a feeling of just indignation, it is assuredly the present. The tendency of its horrible detail is to make the citizen deplore the alteration in the law. It cries aloud for a judicial view of deliberation from which, under other and less aggravated circumstances, the mind would instantly revolt. The fact that the prisoner was a police officer, employed to protect the people from violence and to guard them from outrage, cannot but intensify this sentiment. Beyond question, Conroy richly deserves all the punishment which can lawfully be inflicted upon him. Less than this would be a miscarriage of justice. More, however, would be lynch law under the forms of law. What, after all, is more important than Conroyâ€™s death or imprisonment for life, is accuracy in the administration of justiceâ€”precise conformity to the law. The latter it is our duty to exact, and in doing so to stand, if necessary, between the vilest wretch and even the righteous indignation of those who would add one jot to his punishment beyond what the law prescribes. Such a duty is now plainly before us, and it can only be faithfully performed by the reversal of this judgment and the direction of a new trial.
Davis, P. J.
I have given careful attention to the conflicting opinions of my brothers Beady and Baebett, and a most painstaking examination of the evidence in the case, bearing upon the question in conflict, between them, and my mind is brought to. the conclusion reached by my brother Baebett, that there was no sufficient evidence in the case of such premeditation and deliberation on the part of the prisoner, as is required by the present law of this State to justify a conviction of murder in the first degree.
At common law all felonious killing of a human being with intent to take life was murder, and of that crime there were no degrees.
By the former statute of this State this rule of the common law was sought to be modified by Â«requiring, in murder, proof of a deliberate design to kill. But the courts promptly held that the statute was satisfied whenever the evidence showed to a jury that the act of homicide was the result of a fully formed intent to kill, although the intent was concurrent with the act and had no appreciable antecedent period of deliberation or consideration. This was practically reinstating the law sought to be modified ; or in other words holding that the common law rule had not been changed in substance. It may well be doubted whether the courts would have deemed themselves forced to, or justified in such a construction, if the statutes referred to had created degrees of murder and defined the second degree to be a homicide with design to kill but without deliberation.
Subsequently the Legislature created two degrees of the crime of murder. The first they declared to be the killing of a human being (unless it be excusable or justifiable) when perpetrated with a deliberate and premeditated design to effect the death of the person killed, or of another person; the second they defined to be the killing of a human being with intent to cause the death of the person killed, or another, but without deliberation or premeditation. To the first of these degrees they attached the penalty of death; to the second the absolute penalty of imprisonment for life.
It is impossible now for the courts to hold that the killing of a human being with design to effect death, not accompanied with deliberation and premeditation, is anything more than murder in the second degree, however clear and manifest the design which accompanies and induces the act may be.
It would now be manifest error to charge a jury upon a trial for murder that a clear and manifest design to effect death is itself sufficient evidence of deliberation and premeditation to constitute murder in the first degree; for that is the exact thing which the statute declares shall be murder in the second degree. Hence, there must be, in addition to-proof of design, some satisfactory evidence that it was a â€?deliberate and premeditated design â€?before the crime of murder in the first degree is proven. If past constructions disarm the word â€?deliberateâ€?of any portion of the normal significance, they do not, of course, impair the just sense of the word â€?premeditated,â€?which is new to the statute ; and the conjunction of the two words, in a form which requires the satisfaction of both, especially when accompanied with the creation of a new degree of the crime of murder, which itself requires the presence of an actual and established intent to kill, leaves no door open to doubt that murder in the first degree can now only be shown by proof of some amount or kind of deliberation and premeditation antecedent to the act or blow which intentionally effects the death, and of which the intent alone is not adequate evidence. The intent or design is, of course, necessary in both degrees. It alone is sufficient in the second ; but in the first it must have the characterization of deliberate and premeditated design. There are many modes in which this characterization may be shown ; as, for instance, by procuring and administering poison, by lying in wait, by arming or preparing for the deed in advance, by seeking an opportunity or advantage, by threats of revenge oi hate, or,, in short, any form of words or action which indicates thought and conclusion of a considered purpose to effect a design. My brother Baeeett lias shown how dearly the cases cited by the counsel for the people fall within this rule. It is not necessary to repeat what is so well said.
In the case at bar I am unable to find any evidence to justify a finding of deliberate and premeditated design to effect the death of the person killed, or of any other person. The prisoner was a policeman, but the law of murder for him is no different for that reason. He was charged with duties and trusts which made misconduct a crime on his part peculiarly odious ; but that fact, while it may expose him to the dangers of popular prejudice, and in a sense excuse clamorous condemnation, cannot in law change or affect his guilt or innocence of murder in the first degree. He is not on trial for violation of official duty, but for a felony affecting his life, and in its definition of that crime and its requirements of proof to establish it, the law knows no scale of adjustment that fits a brutal policeman but does not fit other brutal criminals. The Legislature has not so provided ; and that is an answer to every suggestion of undue severity because of official position.
To my mind the evidence against the prisoner fails to show that he entered the drinking saloon of the witness Gody for any purpose of .crime or violence. He went for the purpose of drinking on â€?the treat â€?of a candidate for office. He drank what is called sherry, and it is not difficult to imagine what sort of vile concoction bore that name in that place. The evidence shows that he was peculiarly susceptible to the effects of drink, and he speedily showed its effects upon him. A colloquy and controversy sprung up between him and another, which led, on his part, ""to an offer to fight any person present for moneyâ€”but this passed over, and the prisoner invited every person present to drink. They all drank, a dozen or fifteen in number. The prisoner again drank sherry; when he asked what he had to pay he was told a dollar. The price angered him, and he asked who bad drank. Cody told him all, but the prisoner disputed, and turned to one person, asked what he had drank; he answered, â€?mixed ale.â€?The prisoner called him a liar, and the lie was given back to him. That party approached the prisoner, who immediately struck him and knocked Mm down, and commenced kicking him while down. At this several persons demanded that he let the person up, and all gathered around the prisoner. The party knocked down got up and immediately fled from the saloon. The prisoner, as soon as freed from those holding him, drew his policemanâ€™s club, and went toward the â€?crowd,â€?some of whom retreated into the â€œcard-room,â€?and shut the door ; the prisoner went toward the card-room, and struck with his club, breaking a light of glass in the door; immediately a light was broken from the other side; the prisoner stepped back and drew his revolver and cocked it, and although seized by one person present, who said, â€?Donâ€™t shoot, Billy ; those are my friends,â€?he turned partly around and fired in the direction of three persons standing near each other, and hit the deceased, with whom he had had no controversy, in the abdomen and inflicted a wound from which he afterwards died. The deceased exclaimed that he was â€?done for â€?and fell overâ€”but no one seemed to think at that time that the bullet had\ taken effect. This is the substance of all that took place up to the time of the shooting. It is impossible, I think, to see in it any â€œdeliberate and premeditated designâ€?to effect the death of any person. There was nothing of deliberation or premeditation in the affair. The madness of drink operating upon a brain and system physically and morally weak and wicked, perhaps was there, and very likely a drunken and reckless intent to kill, quite sufficient to justify a conviction of murder in the second degree; but it seems to be in vain to look for evidence of deliberate and premeditated murder.
What afterwards occurred gives no different color to the actual transaction.
It was in substance this : When officers came in, the prisoner pretended to be performing his official duty. The officers examined the deceased and did not discover that he was shot. One proposed to send for an ambulance. The prisoner exclaimed â€?ambulance-, be d.â€”d,the^ man- is, not shot,â€?and he gave into their custody two young men whom he charged with, disorderly conduct, and lie himself dragged out the deceased to take him to the police station. On the way he beat him brutally with his club, but those injuries are shown to have had no effect in causing his death. At the station he stated that he had arrested the deceased for drunkenness and disorderly conduct; that he was assaulted by a mob and his prisoner was recovered and that he shot the prisoner to prevent his escape, and afterwards when he was told the prisoner was really shot, he said in substance he ought to be for he â€?tried hard enough to shoot him.â€?His statements were wholly false. He had not arrested the deceased. There had been no mobâ€”no rescue, or attempt at rescue, and no shooting on such an occasion. This was all a falsehood invented as an excuse for his misconduct as an officer, and the statement that he tried hard to shoot the deceased was not intended'to be anything more than an assertion that he tried hard to do his duty as against a mob of rescuers and an escaping prisoner. It is not to be detached from its context and distorted into an admission that he tried hard to shoot the deceased, while he sat quietly on a whiskey cask in Codyâ€™s saloon at the time he was wounded. To do so is to make the prisonerâ€™s false declaration that something took place that would justify a shooting, a confession of something in conflict with the testimony of every witness on the part of the people,
The actual shooting was clearly the act of an infuriated man, firing with a reckless intent to kill any one who might chance to be in the way of his bulletâ€”but there is not, I think, a symptom of proof that he â€?tried hard to shoot â€?his victim, who by chance happened to be in the range of his reckless aim.
There are several questions in the case arising upon exceptions which seem to me of serious importance ; but I prefer the decision of the case should be put upon the ground that as matter of law there was not sufficient evidence of deliberate and premeditated design to effect death to justify 'the conclusion, so that the Court of Appeals may review our decision and correct it if wrong.
I concur, therefore, in a reversal of the judgment and a new iriaL
Brady, J.
The controlling facts upon which the appellant was convicted are these : He had by his aggressive conduct driven nearly all the persons from the saloon (fourteen or fifteen in number) in which the deceased was shot, some of them taking refuge in the card-room, which was separated from the saloon by a partition, having a door partially of glass opening into it, and others in a rear room or hall. Those who remained in the saloon were the proprietor, Cody, his wife, Cantwell, Keating and the deceased. The appellant approached the door mentioned, and observing that one of the persons who had retreated was exposing his head, doubtless to ascertain where the appellant was, struck at the head but missed it and broke some of the glass. He then backed from the door and as he did so put his club in his belt and deliberately drew his revolver, which he had some trouble in taking from his pocket. Keating seeing this said to him, â€?For Godâ€™s sake, Billy, donâ€™t fire; those are friends of mine.â€?The appellant paid no attention to this-request, but turned towards where the deceased was standing with others, raised his revolver and fired the fatal shot. He"" attempted another shot, but was stopped by Keating and Buck,, ley. When asked by the sergeant at the station-house after his arrest, â€?Conroy, is this man shot ?â€?he said, â€?I donâ€™t know. If he is not, it is not my fault. I tried hard enough to shoot him.â€?This conduct was by the jury declared to be that of a person entirely responsible for his acts, and not that of one affected-mentally either by the element of insanity or temporary derangement arising from the effect of liquor taken. He hadâ€?displayed a belligerent spirit soon after entering the saloon,- and liaving provoked a quarrel with one Mâ€™eGuinness, knocked-' him down-and continued to maltreat him until he was dragged away. The brutal recklessness of the- murderous desperado had seized him, and when he drew his pistol he determined to-shoot some one of the persons who remained in the saloon, a resolution strengthened doubtless by the request of Keating, a result natural in the conduct of a person controlled by the bravado spirit which then influenced him. He had resolved to shoot notwithstanding he had no enemy to confront him ; was not in-danger by act or threat- of any one present, and knew his victim must be one of the persons present. The deceased was to him the most insignificant, apparently, and suited his design. His purpose was to shoot, and he carried it out by discharging his weapon at the deceased, towards whom it must have been pointed or it would not have taken effect upon him. There is no pretense that the ball from the pistol was deflected by contact with any substance. It was sent directly into the body of the deceased.
We have then apparently the pre-existing murderous intent carried out by the shot, the premeditation and deliberation culminating in the shot at the deceased, a fact demonstrated by the declaration of the appellant that if the deceased was not â– shot it was not his faultâ€”he' tried hard enough to do it. This â– is undoubtedly the theory upon which the jury rendered the .verdict given, and whether it was right or not is the only question of the least importance here.
The legal proposition necessary to sustain the verdict upon â€¢these facts and this theory is, that if a person in the company -of several deliberately resolves to shoot one of them, and does the act contemplated, he may be charged with having killed â– the person shot with a premeditated and deliberate design to effect his death. It is not necessary, under such circumstances, â– in order to properly convict a person of murder in the first degree, to show that when the intention to shoot was formed-the person shot was also then selected and determined upon. It is enough if there be a general design to shoot one of the persons present and such intention is carried out.
The Penal Code by section 183 provides by the first subdivision that the killing of a.human being is murder in the first degree, when committed from a deliberate and premeditated design to effect the death of a person killed or of another. This contemplates as well as others the crime of killing a person not within the intent Â©f.the killer, and slain in error or by mistake. If the design is to kill B., and the shot misdirected kills 0., it is murder if the elements exist .-which would make it murder had B. been killed in accordance with the original intent. If the design be to kill one or several present, and one be selected in accordance with such design, it is not at all illogical or unreasonable to declare that the person killed was slain by premeditation. The case as presented to the jury having the characteristics mentioned, it could not be taken from them. Indeed, they were warranted in declaring the presence of the design stated, not only from the acts of the appellant but his subsequent declaration that if he did not shoot the deceased it was not his faultâ€”he tried hard enough to do it.
In estimating the force and effect of the circumstances to which reference has been made, we must bear in mind that we are dealing with a sane person having no enemy to overcome, but brutally excited, and drawing his pistol without reasonâ€?without cause, and seemingly for no other than a murderous purpose and after he had without its use created a reign of terror. He had time enough to deliberate upon the act of shooting. The law upon that subject was clearly and accurately charged and no exception was taken to what was said. The court said in reference to deliberation and premeditationâ€”quoting from the opinion of Justice Earle in the People v. Majone, 91 N. Y. 211; 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 95â€”that the design must precede the killing by some appreciable time, but the time need not be long. It was sufficient if time existed for choice to kill or not to kill and when the time was sufficient for that it matters not how brief.
The appellant, it must be observed, was advised of the impropriety of his contemplated actâ€”he was warned against it by a request made of him not to shoot, to which he paid no attention. He did not mean to be interfered with; he was the master of the situation and meant to maintain that attitude. He was cool and collected when he reached the station-house, and his declaration there made was undoubtedly understood by him.
It matters not what we may conjecture as to the spirit in which it was said or the emotion which prompted it. It must be united to other events and he must take the consequences resulting from it. If the jury had not found that he was then wholly responsible for his conduct, we should be obliged to assert this to have been his condition when the declaration mentioned was made. There is and can be no pretense that he was as much excited at that time as he was in the saloon. He was then where he could not hold supreme sway either as a bully, bravado or desperado.
The history of this country unfortunately is not without precedent for terrorisms created by one individual even without the semblance of authority, a feature not marking the appellantâ€™s career on the occasion referred to, inasmuch as he was dressed in his uniform and had all the insignia necessary to enable him to act as the official bullyâ€”the man in power, in brief authority.
It is tr",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e that all the witnesses for the people did not tally in their details of the occurrence, but the jury had the right to accept such version as the evidence best commended to their judgment, and the assumed controlling facts herein recited are established by it. The witnesses were not sufficiently in conflict to make it difficult to reconcile their testimony and establish a satisfactory basis for the judgment arrived at, and particularly inasmuch as the witnesses who said the pistol was pointed at the floor or a barrel, must have been mistaken, as the ball discharged from it entered the body of the deceased and without deflection, as already suggested.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whether the premeditation and deliberation required by the statute as an ingredient of murder in the first degree existed or not is, as already suggested, the only question at issue on this appeal, none of the exceptions taken having any real value. The charge was elaborate and clear. Indeed, it was pronounced by the learned and experienced counsel for the appellant to be most fair, and numerous requests to charge which he had handed to the court, were withdrawn by him. After a careful, deliberate and conscientious examination of this case, therefore, with, I hope, a just sense of my responsibility, I am unable to agree with the conclusion that the learned justice who presided at the General Sessions, could in the face of the appellantâ€™s statement at the station-house, in connection with the other facts, withdraw the element of premeditation from the consideration of the jury. The question of the appellantâ€™s innocence or guilt was for them to determine on the evidence. They are the judges of the facts, and if a reasonable view of the evidence sustains their finding it should not be disturbed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1167721,YORK v. PEOPLE,1884-01,"Hardin, J.
Plaintiff in error was indicted in Allegany county for having obtained deposits of money with the firm of York & Chamberlin, and doing business in Wellsville in said county, by means of false pretenses, â€?on or about the first day of January, 1878.â€?The indictment, among other things, charges the plaintiff in error with having falsely represented to Leonard H. Frisbey â€?that he and one Calvin T. Chamberlin were copartners in the banking business under the firm name of York & Chamberlin: that said Chamberlin was worth from $50,000 to $100,000, and that said bank was solvent, sound and good,â€?and that Frisbey delivered to the said Hiram York $1,500, and â€?did then and there deposit the said money in a banking-house which was then being run by said York under the name of York & Chamberlin ... as was alleged by said York at that time, and in which said Chamberlin was a copartner as said York then and there alleged . . . and the said Hiram York did then and there designedly receive and obtain of the said Leon ard H. Frisbey the said proper moneys and valuable things ... by means of the false pretenses and representations aforesaid, and got him to deposit the same in and with said banking house, and with intent to cheat and defraud the said Leonard H. Frisbey of the same:â€?The indictment then alleges that said York and Chamberlin were not copartners in the banking business, doing business at Wellsville . . . under the firm name of York & Chamberlin. It then alleges â€?said Chamberlin was not in any manner connected with or interested in the banking house or bank where said Frisbey deposited his said money as aforesaid; that York was running said banking-house alone and not as a copartner with said Chamberlin ; that said banking house or bank was not solvent, sound and good, but was insolvent, unsound and not good, and the pretenses and representations so made as aforesaid by the said York to the said Leonard FI. Frisbey were in all respects utterly false and untrue.â€?During the trial evidence was given in respect to Chamberlainâ€™s connection with the business, and tending to show that he had not dissolved bis copartnership with York, which had existed many years prior to the time named in the indictment as to the representations.
It appeared Chamberlain died the last of June, 1878. Proof was given tending to show the representations were made, as alleged, as to pecuniary standing of Chamberlain as alleged in the indictment. There was no definite and positive proof thereof showing his assets and liabilities at the time of his death, nor in the month of January, 1878. But instead thereof, one Gabriel Bishop was called as a witness by the people, who testified <c that he was conversant with Mr. Chamberlinâ€?s business and knew of his real estate and his personal estate and of his bank stock and of his debts, and knew of this in 1877, and up to June 1878.â€?The case states, viz.: â€?He was then asked what, in his opinion, was the financial standing of Calvin T. Chamberlin from October, 1877, to February, 1878.â€?This was objected to on numerous grounds, and among others, on the ground that the witness should be confined to facts; that his opinion was not evidence.
The witness was asked by the defendantâ€™s counsel if the will of Chamberlin was admitted to probate and he said it was, and that he was one of the executors, and that debts had been presented to him as executor; that the will disposed of real and personal estate ; that the real estate was a matter of record, and mortgages given to Chamberlin and owned by him were of record; and that Chamberlin owned a large tract of timber land in Pennsylvania, which was a matter of record.
The objections were renewed and they were overruled, â€?and the witness was permitted to give his opinion,â€?and stated â€?that he was of the opinion that Chamberlin was during such time insolvent.â€?Defendant took an exception to the reception of such testimony, and asked to strike out such testimony, and the motion therefor was denied, and the defendant again excepted.
The ruling calls upon us to consider whether the opinion of the witness was competent. He was not asked to state as a fact the standing of Chamberlin financially, but his opinion in respect to it. The question did not call for the facts known to the witness, nor as to the fact of what his standing was, but squarely for the opinion of the witness. In Thompson v. Hall (45 Barb. 216), the court said of a question in respect to a partyâ€™s being able to pay his debts at a time mentioned, that it was competent as a fact, and he added : â€œI do not understand the question as calling for the opinion of the witness simply.â€?That case is not an authority to sustain the ruling before us, but on the contrary indicates that the learned judge who wrote the opinion, was adverse to the reception of a witnessâ€?opinion as to the financial standing of a party. In Dermott v. Campbell (17 Hun, 88), it was held error to allow a question put in the following words, viz.: â€?Is Donald Campbell a man of responsibility?â€?Slingerland v. Bennett (6 Sup. Ct. [T. & C.] 446), does not contain the ruling made in this case in hand. There the question collaterally arose as to the standing of a party reputed to be a man of wealth. The repute of the party inquired about was not directly involved in the issue. It was very important in this case to establish the financial standing and ability of Chamberlin in January, 1878, and the fact was one which might have been proven by satisfactory testimony. The opinion of Bishop was not admissible, and it was wholly insufficient to prove what Chamberlin was worth in January, 1878. See Haggerty v. R. R. Co., 6 Abb. N. C. 131.
In the course of the charge delivered by the court, the standing of Chamberlin, the evidence bearing upon the representation as to his being worth $50,000 to $100,000, and the evidence as to his insolvency, were referred to, and the jury were left to find that the representation was made that he was worth $50,000 to $100,000, and that when it was made that Chamberlin in fact was insolvent, and to convict upon finding such facts.
The evidence of Bishopâ€™s opinion was thereby made important and influential before the jury, and the erroneous reception of his opinion may have produced the conviction. For that error, we think there should be a reversal and a new trial. Order and conviction reversed and proceedings remitted to the Court of Sessions of Alleghany county, with directions for a new trial.

1167690,PEOPLE v. D'ARGENCOUR,1884-04,"Miller, J.
The defendant was indicted and convicted for the crime of forgery in the second degree, on the first count contained in the indictment. .This charged that the defendant made, and engraved, and caused and procured to be made and engraved a plate in the form and similitude of a promissory note, issued by a bank at Havana, in the Island of Cuba for the payment of fifty centavos, said bank being a bank incorporated -under the laws of the kingdom of Spain, without the authority of said bank and in violation of the statutes of the state.
The counsel for the appellant insists that the court erred in refusing to advise the jury to acquit on the ground that there was no legal evidence offered by the people that the alleged bank was incorporated under the laws of the kingdom of Spain.
Upon the trial a witness was introduced and sworn on behalf of the people, who testified that he was a banker in New York city ; that lie had been in the bank named in the alleged forged note ; that the bank issued notes which were received as money; that his firm were the agents of said bank in the city of New York; that when he was in this bank at Havana, he saw banking business carried on. He further testified that the said bank was incorporated under the laws of Spain. That he saw the articles of incorporation in a book which was in the court room on the .day of the trial, that from what he saw there and also from what he saw in the official organ, the paper of â– the Spanish government, he believed it to be so; that this â– official paper was published by the government, and only contains official news, the chief laws, and any change in the administration that-interests the public. The fact of the bank Â¡being incorporated was also proved by the engraver connected with the American Bank Note Company, and that it had en.-graved the plates from which the genuine notes of the bank were printed and which plates were then in the vaults of said company.
We think that this evidence was sufficient to show the existence of the bank without producing the law to establish the. fact that the bank had been incorporated, and the act of incorporation, and that there was no error in the refusal of the court to advise the jury as requested.
The rule has long been established. in this state, that it is not necessary, on an indictment for forgery of bank notes, to prove by direct evidence the incorporation of the bank, and that, testimony of the most general character is sufficient for such a-purpose. In People v. Davis (21 Wend. 309) it was held, on an indictment for having in possession, with intent to pass, bank notes purporting to have been issued by a banking corporation of a state other than that of New York, that it was not necessary to show that there was, in fact, such a corporation in existence; at all events, proof of the most general character of its existence would be sufficient. The same rule is applicable here, and the proof introduced was clearly sufficient to establish the legal existence of the bank within the authority cited. Any other or different rule would cause great difficulty on a trial of this description, and very greatly interfere with the administration of justice in such cases. The general practice has been in cases of this character to produce general evidence as to the incorporation of the bank upon which the alleged forgery was committed. Such being the rule in this state, it would seem to be unnecessary to examine whether the same or a different rule exists elsewhere. The case of People v. Peabody (25 Wend. 472), cited by the appellantâ€™s counsel, is not adverse to the rule laid down in People v. Davis (supra), as that was a case where an intent was charged to defraud-, the bank, and it is there laid down that to constitute the- offense of forgery, in counterfeiting the notes of a bank, it is not necessary that such bank as the notes purport to have been issued by, should have a legal existence, and it is enough that the notes purport to have been issued by a corporation Â©r company duly authorized to issue notes.
The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, sections 956-7-8 and 942, have no application to an indictment for counterfeiting bank notes. The. rule- in civil cases in regard to proof of this character is different, and the proof of the existence of the bank upon which the- forgery was committed was entirely sufficient in the case at bar.
It is further insisted that the court erred in refusing to advise the jury to acquit, upon the ground that the indictment does not set forth any instrument which purports to be a pecuniary obligation of the bank. This point relates to the allegation in the indictment that the note alleged to have been made and engraved was for the payment of â€?fifty centavos,â€?and the claim is that the terms employed do not show of themselves that â€?centavos â€?are money, or that the alleged promise involved any pecuniary obligation to pay on the part, of the bank. The charge in the indictment which is referred to, is for making and engraving, and causing and procuring to be made and engraved, a plate in the form and similitude of a promissory note in violation of the statute (3 R. S. 7th ed. 2488, Â§Â§ 30, 31), and it was not necessary to sustain the allegation, to define the meaning of the word referred to. It is of no importance whether an explanation was given to the word â€?centavos â€?or not.
If that word had not been engraved upon the plate, the engraving and making of the plate unfinished would have been in violation of the statute, and the indictment was clearly good without defining or attempting to give a definition to the word â€?centavos.â€?The appellantâ€™s counsel relies upon the case of' Sanabria v. People (24 Hun, 270), but that case is entirely different from the one at bar. The indictment there was for attempting to forge an instrument purporting to be a pecuniary obligation of the Empire of Brazil, which was set forth in the Portuguese language with an English translation which did not define what was meant by the terms there used for money in the Portuguese language, and it was held that as the term used was not money of this country, and as the court could not take judicial notice that it was a coin at all, it did not appear that the instrument involved any pecuniary demand or obligation upon the part of the Empire of Brazil, and that the indictment was insufficient. It will be observed that the charge related to the forging of an instrument which created a pecuniary obligation, and sufficient did not appear upon the face of the indictment to show that any such obligation was forged, and thus no crime was alleged. The allegation here is entirely different, and a crime would be made out if the engraving had been but partially completed, and hence the case cited is not applicable.
Nor was any error committed by the court in refusing to advise the jury to acquit upon. the ground that there was no evidence showing the want of authority on the part of defend ant to make the plate- The evidence of such want of authority we think was sufficiently established by the agent of the bank in this country, who testified that no one save the Bank Note Company had been authorized through him to do any engraving for the bank, and the lithographer whose company had the genuine plates in its possession. The proof was positive that plates had been manufactured for the bank by the American Bank Note Company, who retained possession of the same, and the agentâ€™s testimony therefore tends to show that the defendant had no authority for any such purpose. In view of this testimony it is not probable that any other person was authorized to engrave plates for the bank, and it devolved upon the defendant to establish to the contrary if such was the fact. The people were not bound, in view of the proof given, to show a negative, and the evidence introduced by the defendant, for the purpose of establishing authority, was not of itself sufficient for that purpose. As the case stood it was for the jury to determine whether a want of authority was established, and it cannot as a matter of law be held, that there was a failure of the prosecution in this respect.
It is further objected that the indictment was fatally defective in not charging an intent to defraud some individual or corporation. The indictment charged an offense in violation of the provisions of sections 30 and 31 of the Revised Statutes (supra). There is nothing in these provisions which requires that there should be an intent to defraud any individual or corporation. The offense was committed in September, 1882, before the Penal Code went into effect, and hence the charge made in the indictment must be in accordance with the provisions of the statute cited, and therefore it was not necessary to allege any such intent. But aside from this view of the question presented, and assuming that the provisions of section 511 of the Penal Code are applicable, it is a sufficient answer to the point urged to say that the question was not raised so as to be available to the defendant. Section 469, of the Code of .Criminal Procedure required a motion to be made for that purpose before or at the time when the defendant was called for judgment. This was not done but a motion was made in arrest of judgment, and for a new trial, the grounds of which were confined to the exceptions taken at the trial and to the judgeâ€™s charge, and did not therefore include this alleged defect. By failing to present the question, the defendant waived the right to object that the indictment was defective for want of an averment of an intent to defraud. The provisions of section 527 of the Code of Criminal Procedure do not aid the defendant, as the power conferred upon the Supreme Court to grant a new trial, when the verdict is against the weight of evidence, or against law, or when justice required a new trial, whether any exception shall have been taken or not in the court below, is a discretionary one, and as it cannot be said that the discretion has been abused by the Greneral Term of the Supreme Court, the decision is not reviÃ©wable upon appeal to this court.
It is also insisted that there was no proof of an intent on the part of the defendant to defraud. The question of intent was one for the jury. Although the plate was not entirely complete, yet it was sufficiently so, to evince that it was intended for the printing of notes of the description of those issued by the bank named thereon. This is shown by the description given by one of the witnesses upon the trial. It conforms to similar parts of a genuine plate. The question of defendantâ€™s good faith was for the jury, and in view of the evidence it cannot be said that there was no ground for claiming that the act of the defendant was without any intent to defraud or to commit a crime in violation of the statute. The judgment should be affirmed.
All concur.

1167697,PEOPLE v. MULLER,1884-03,"Daniels, J.
The defendant was charged by the indictment with selling a certain indecent and obscene photograph, representing a nude female in a lewd, obscene, indecent, scandalous â€¢and lascivious attitude and posture, and also with having in his 'possession divers lewd, scandalous, obscene and indecent photographs representing divers nude female figures, in various lewd, indecent, immoral, lascivious, scandalous and obscene attitudes and postures, against the form of the statute in such case made, &c.
This indictment was presented under section 317 of the Penal Code, which has declared if to be a misdemeanor for any person to sell, lend, give away, or offer to give away, or show, or to have in his possession with intent to sell, or give away, or show, or advertise, or otherwise offer for loan, gift, sale or distribution, an obscene, or indecent book, writings, paper, picture, drawing, or photograph. Evidence was given upon the trial under both .of these counts of the indictment showing the sale of card photographs by the defendant, and of his having in his possession or under his control for the general purposes of sale, in the course of his employment, other card photographs of the same description. These photographs were produced in evidence for the inspection and observation of the jury, and there was no denial on the part of the defendant that such photographs were kept for sale in the store in which he was a clerk, and- were there exhibited and sold, as that was desired by customers dealing with him at the store. The statute has not particularly described what, within its intent and purpose, should be considered obscene or indecent. But as these are words of well known signification, it must have been intended by the' legislature in the enactment of this law, to use.them in their popular sense and understanding. And they consequently include all pictures, drawings, and photographs of an indecent and immoral tendency, intending to include as obscene such as are offensive to chastity, demoralizing and sensual in their character, by exposing what purity and decency forbid to be shown, and productive of libidinous and lewd thoughts,-or emotions. The photographs produced upon the trial have been handed up on the argument of the appeal as they had been marked as exhibits upon the trial. They are photographs of nude females in a variety of attitudes and postures which the jury might very well, and naturally would, determine to be both indecent and obscene in their character. Ordinarily they would be so pronounced, although they would not exert the same demoralizing and sensual effects upon all persons alike. Their judgment would be the same, that these photographs and pictures would tend to promote vicious and sensual misconduct, and prove injurious to the morals of the community, especially to those whose judgment and experience were not sufficient to control the impulses of their passions. And as the statute has given this general definition of the character of the acts constituting the offense, it must necessarily have been designed that the drawing, picture, photograph, or writing should be exhibited to and.observed by the jury, for them to determine, as a matter of fact, in the exercise of their good sense and judgment, whether or not they were obscene and indecent. That was considered the proper course to be pursued in Regina v. Hicklin, Law Rep. 3 Q. B. 360, 1867-8, in which the justiceâ€™s order was affirmed upon such action. It was approved in the Circuit Court of the United States in the case of the United States v. Bennett, in an elaborate opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Blatchford, and it seems to bo the only mode in which the charge made in the indictment could be properly tried, or the law itself vindicated, or carried into effect. The question in all these cases must be, what is the impression produced upon the mind, by perusing, or observing, the writing, or picture, referred to in the indictment; and one person is as competent to determine that as another. Where the impression or conviction would be in the case of a photograph or picture, that it is meretricious and intended to exhibit the arts of a harlot, or to induce or promote prostitution, or to offend decency, and cause loose and shameless thoughts, there would be sufficient grounds to pronounce its sale, possession, or exhibition to be a violation of this section of the statute. The difference between such photographs and pictures, and those which, avoiding all indecency of position, are calculated by their symmetry, beauty, or purity, simply to inspire admiration, or produce emotions of chaste pleasure, is striking and apparent to all. In the one case the effect is coarse, demoralizing and sensual, while in the other the chaste elegance and beauty would not be debasing, but refining, by the degree of admiration produced by it. While the former class would be debasing and vicious, the latter would be productive of no such effects. And it is in this manner particularly that the photographs produced upon the trial and argument of this case are clearly distinguishable from those productions which are tolerated and Commended by the intelligent judgment of the community.
This difference is striking and apparent at once from the production itself, and requires no more than the observation of jurors to discover it, and to distinguish that which is criminal under the terms of the law, from that which may properly be held not to be prohibted by any of its provisions. In this case the jury exercised their judgment by means ""of the observation and examination of the photographs referred to in the indictment, and determined them to be of the vicious and immoral character prohibited by the statute. This court cannot say' that they erred in their conclusions, but on the other hand the determination which they made seems to have been well sustained by the nature and character of the photographs themselves.
It was urged upon the trial, and evidence was offered to be given to establish the fact that the photographs were taken from pictures publicly exhibited in reputable European places. But that proof would not change the nature of the influence they were calculated to exert, and would not relieve the defendant from the charge of violating the provisions of the statute. If pictures of the same description were exhibited and tolerated elsewhere that fact would be entitled to no effect in determining whether this statute had, or had not, been violated in their exhibition and sale within the county of New York.
The object of the law was to protect public morals, especially of that class of the community whose character is not so completely formed as to be proof against the lewd effects of the pictures, photographs and publications prohibited. And where it may be violated that violation would in no sense be relieved by proof that similar acts were tolerated by the public authorities of other states' or countries.
The defendant offered in evidence a number of photographs of a somewhat similar description to those produced on the part of the prosecution, but not in such a state of complete nudity, and they were rejected by the court. This offer was made for the purpose of laying before the jury evidence of the manner in which the business of taking and selling female photographs had been conducted and permitted by the public authorities, and from them it probably was proposed to be argued that the defendant had not so far exceeded the license inferred from this neglect, as to be criminally culpable under this section of the statute. But if these photographs had been received, inasmuch as they differed in their lewd features from those relied upon in support of the prosecution, they could not have been of any. service to the defendant. For the license or liberty to publish and sell those which were offered in evidence, would fall far short of tolerating the possession, exhibition or sale of those upon which the prosecution was instituted. Still another answer exists to the offer of the evidence, and that is the fact that proving other persons to have violated the law, would in no manner tend to the exculpation of the defendant, if his acts were in contravention of its provisions.
The court was not called upon to try the question whether the persons possessing or selling the photographs of the description offered by the defendant had violated the statute or not. Ho comparison could be required to be made between them and those upon which the issue in the case depended, for the purpose of determining intelligently whether the defendant was guilty of violating the law or not. There was no view in which this evidence could have been of service to the defendant, or by which he on account of it could have been relieved from the consequences of his own acts. The introduction of the photographs would have been of no legal benefit to him, but might have injured his case by convincing the jury that there was great necessity for the interposition of the authorities and the enforcement of the law, to arrest and end this nefarious business. In the same view various copies of the publications known as â€?The National Police Gazetteâ€?â€?The Illustrated Police Newsâ€?and the â€?Weekly Varietiesâ€?were offered to he read in evidence upon the trial, by. the defendantâ€™s counsel, but they were rejected by the court.
If they had been received, and entitled to the sanction of the court and jury, they would have afforded no assistance whatever to the defendant, because- the photographs he was charged with selling and possessing, were so far in their lewdness in excess of those contained in these publications as to prevent him from shielding himself under the same liberty. If they did not violate the law in any of these publications, it would not follow that he had not been, guilty, and if they did, then there was a still greater reason for his conviction. For his offense was much more- aggravated im its character.
It may be that some-of these publications would be regarded by a jury of intelligent men as too-obscene and indecent to be tolerated by even a liberal administration of the law. But whÃ©ther they would or not is not now required to be even suggested in the disposition of this case. If further prosecutions shall be instituted, the-circumstances upon which they depend,, will after that, be more appropriate for the careful consideration of the court. There was no error in excluding any portion of the evidence offered to be given by the defendant upon the trial. Practically there was no doubt as to what he had done, and it was simply for the jury to say whether the articles he dealt in were obscene and indecent, or not, and that was to be chiefly determined from the appearance of those photographs. The evidence which was offered and rejected would in no manner, if it had been received, afford the defendant protection against the legal consequences of his acts.
At the close of the ease several propositions were presented to the court which it was requested should be submitted to the jury, but as they did not involve the point whether these particular photographs were obscene or indecent, it was not necessary that they should be submitted.
They were more in the nature of abstract propositions, so far as this prosecution was concerned, than relating to the disposition of the case as it was presented by the evidence. It was not essential to the proper determination of the case that these matters should have been submitted to the jury.
If they had been, their submission would have been of no service to the defendant, for the point would still remain for the consideration of the jury to determine whether these particular photographs were obscene and indecent. They determined that against the defendant, and that fact without reference to these general propositions, sufficiently brought the case within the statute to require his conviction.
By the judgment which was pronounced, he was subjected to no severe degree of punishment, the object of the court being more especially to arrest and break up a traffic, that could not be carried on without endangering the good morals of the community, and it is probable that if other cases of this description shall be brought before the courts in which a conviction may follow, that the same degree of leniency cannot be expected. The .judgment in the case should be affirmed.
Davis. P. J.. concurs.
The case referred to is United States v. De Borgne M. Bennett (U. S. Circuit Ct. S. District of New York, May, 1879), 16 Blatchf. 338.
Bennett was indicted for sending obscene literature through the United States mails. The conviction was affirmed on appdal, and an opinion was written by Blatchford, J. (Benedict and Choate, JJ., con. curred.) Only that portion of the opinion relating to the test of obscenity is here given :
Blatchford, J.-â€”In Regina Â®. Hicklin (L. B. 3 Q. B. 360) the question arose as to what was an â€œobsceneâ€?book within a statute authorizing the destruction of obscene books. The book in question was to a considerable extent an obscene publication, and, by reason of the obscene matter in it, was calculated to produce a pernicious effect in depraving and debauching the. minds of the persons into whose hands it might come. It was contended, however, that although such was the tendency of the book upon the public mind, yet as the immediate intention of the person selling it was not so to affect the public mind, but to expose certain alleged practices and errors of a religious system, the book was not obscene. As to this point Oh. J. Cockburn said; â€œI think that if there be an infraction of the law, the intention to break the law must be inferred, and the criminal character of the publication is not affected or qualified by there being some ulterior object in view (which is the immediate and prim, ary object of the parties) of a different and an honest character. It is quite clear that the publishing an obscene book is an offense against the law of the land. It is perfectly true, as has been pointed out by Mr. Kydd,'Â¡ that there are a great many publications of high repute in the literary productions of this country, the tendency of -which is immodest, and, if you please, immoral, and possibly there might have been subject matter for indictment in many of the works which have been referred to. But it is not to be said, because there are in many standard and established works objectionable passages, that therefore the law is not, as alleged on the part of this prosecution, namely, that obscene, works are the subject matter of indictment; and I think the test of obscenity is this, whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall. Now, with regard to this work, it is quite certain that it would suggest to the minds of the young of either sex, or even to persons of more advanced years, thoughts of a most impure and libidinous character.â€?These views seem to us very sound. In the present case, the remarks made by the court in its charge, as to the test of obscenity, were made in reference to suggestions like those made in the Hicklin case. It was contended that the motive and object of the book were material. On this question the court said: â€œThe question is whether this man mailed an obscene book, not why he mailed it. His motive may have been ever so pure; if the book he mailed was obscene, he is guilty. You see then, that all you are called upon to determine in this case is, whether the marked passages in this book are obscene, lewd, or of an indecent charter. Now, I give you the test by ""which you are to determine this question.' It is a test which has been often applied, has passed the examination Ã³f many courts, and I repeat it here as the test to be used by you. You will apply this test to these marked passages, and if, judged by this test, you find any of them to be obscene or of an indecent character, it will be your duty to find the prisoner guilty. If you do not find them, judged by this test, to be obscene, or of an indecent character, it will be your duty to acquit him. This is the test of obscenity within the meaning of the statute: â€?It is whether,â€?&c. The test then stated is substantially the same as that Stated by Ch. J. Cockborn. The words â€œcharged as obscenity,â€?and the word â€œimmoral,â€?used by Ch. J. Cockburn, are dropped, and the words â€œthe morals of â€?are not used by Ch. J. Cockburn. But the meaning of the two sentences is identical. The case of ReginaÂ®. Hicklin was approved in Stelle Â®. Brennan (_L. S. 7 G. P. 261), where Ch. J. Bovill states that he fully concurs in the decision in Regina Â®. Hicklin.
In the case against Heywood, before referred to, the defendant was the writer of the book, and the book was the same book which' is in question in the present case. In the trial of the Heywood case, Judge Clakk, in charging the jury, said: â€œA book is obscene which is offensive to decency. A book to be obscene need not be obscene throughout the whole of its contents, but if the book is obscene, lewd or lascivious or indecent in whole or part, it is an obscene book within the meaning of the lawâ€”a lewd and lascivious and indecent book, A book is said to be obscene which is offensive to decency or chastity, which is immodest, which is indelicate, impure, causing lewd thoughts of an immoral tendency. A book is said to be lewd which is incited by lust, or excites lustful thoughts, leading to irregular indulgence of animal desires, lustful, lecherous, libidinous. A book is lascivious which is lustful, which excites or promotes impure sexual desires. A book is indecent which is unbecoming, immodest, unfit to be seen. A book which is obscene, as I have said to you before, or lewd, or lascivious or indecent, in whole or in part, or in its general scope or tendency in its plates or pictures, or in its reading matter, falls within the scope of the prohibition of the statute. . . . An argument has been made here to show you that Mr. Heywood was a moral man, a well-behaved man, and that his design in publishing this work was a good one, that he really believed the doctrines which he taught. But the court say to you that such an argument cannot be received and considered by you, and cannot make any difference in the question of guilt or innocence. A man might believe that obscene things may be and ought to be corrected, and he might argue against them, and publish for this purpose; but still the book might not be allowed to go through tlie mails, if obscene in itself. It is not the design. There is no reference in the statute to the design that a mau has in putting the book in the mail, whether for good or a bad purpose; but the law says explicitly that such books shall not go through the mails, and that, if anybody deposits them, he is to be punished for it. There is no question here in regard to the suppression or the spread of knowledge. . . . Something was said in regard to other booksâ€”that these books are no more offensive than some other books; but. you are not sent here to try other books, nor to compare this book with other books, and you heard the court rule out all other books. â€?The sole question is, whether these books are obscene, lewd or indecent. Other books may be so or may not be so. They may or may not have gone in the mail. . . . Observations were made in regard to the extent to which these books might be obscene, lewd, lascivious or impure, or might excite unlawful or impure desires; and it was said to you, that you might read these books, and hey would excite no impure desire in you, no impure thought; but that is not a sure criterion, by any means. These books are not sent ordinarily to such people as you. But you may consider whether they arÃ© obscene, or lewd, or lascivious to any considerable portion of the community, or whether they excite impure desires in the minds of the boys and girls or other persons that are susceptible to such impure thoughts and desires. If any other standard were adopted, probably no book would be obscene, because there would be some men and women so pure perhaps that it would not excite an impure thought; but it is to be governed by its effect upon the communityâ€”whether it is obscene, and is of dangerous tendency in the community generally, or any considerable portion of the community. These views are in substance those contained in the charge in the present case.
We are of opinion that there was no error in what was charged by the court as to the test of obscenity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1167693,PEOPLE v. VAN VECHTEN,1884-01,"Potter, J.
The defendant, was a hotel-keeper, and upon Â«the night.of the occurrence complained of, was entertaining a company at a dance. The complainant attempted to open the door to enter defendantâ€™s house. According to the complainantâ€™s testimony and that of the witnesses for the prosecution, who saw the transaction, the defendant immediately seized the complainant by the whiskers and commenced beating him in the face, after making the remark â€?if complainant comes into my house I ,will kill him.â€?The defendant offered to show upon the trial that he had previously forbidden complainant to come into his house. Ho time when so forbidden is indicated by the question, or the circumstances under which he forbade him. This was offered with view of justifying the beating. I do not think it-shonld be .allowed to serve that purpose. Assuming he had forbidden him to .enter, I think when he attempted to enter or had entered, the defendant should have requested or have ordered him to'leave, and for a failure to comply the defendant might have lawfully used the necessary force to eject him or remove him from the premises. But the defendant made no such request or order, but seized him by the whiskers and struck him repeatedly in the face. It is not the reasonable or lawful way to remove a trespasser from oneâ€™s premises, to seize him by the whiskers and keep him on the premises while the owner is striking the trespasser in the face. The purpose of the defendant to punish and not simply remove the trespasser is plain. The key to it is found in the defendantâ€™s expression, â€?if complainant comes into my house I will kill him.â€?The offer to prove by the defendant that complainant was drunk was properly overruled. If it were so, it has nothing to do with the justification, for that was not the objection to complainantâ€™s entry. Besides it would be going too far to allow any witness to express an opinion upon the subject or question of anotherâ€™s intoxication, until it had appeared by the witnessâ€?testimony, that he had made some observations in that direction or had any opportunity of doing so. Upon the whole, I do not believe the ends of public justice require or would justify a new trial.

1167677,PEOPLE v. RAYMOND,1884-03,"Brady, J.
The defendant was convicted in the court of General Sessions in October 1883, of the crime of forgery in the first degree, as a second offense, under section 688 of the Penal Code. It was charged in the indictment that the defends ant in March 1877, pleaded guilty to the commission of a felony, and was sentenced to five yearsâ€?imprisonment. The first offense was forgery in the third degree, the extreme penalty of which, under the Eevised Statutes, was imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years. See 3d vol. B. S. 6tli ed. p. 946. Under the Penal Code the punishment of forgery in the third degree is the same. See Â§ 525. The punishment of forgery in the first degree, under the Eevised Statutes (see page above indicated) was imprisonment in the state prison for a term not less than ten years, and it might be for life. Therefore under the Code the punishment is the same. Section 523.
In refcretice to the punishment for a second offense, the provisions of the Eevised Statutes (6th ed. p. 989, Â§ 8) declare that if a person shall be subsequently convicted cf an offense, which upon a first conviction, would be punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a term exceeding five years, he should be punished by imprisonment in a state prison for a term not less than ten years, and that if the subsequent offense be such that upon a first conviction the offender would be punished by imprisonment in a state prison for five years or any less term, then the person convicted should be punished by imprisonment in a state prison for a term not exceeding ten years.
The Penal Code went into effect on the 1st of December, 1882. By section 688, it is provided that if the subsequent crime is such, that upon the first conviction the offender might be punished, in the discretion of the court, by imprisonment for life, he must be sentenced to imprisonment in the state prison for life. And by subdivision 2, if the subsequent crime is such that upon a first conviction the offender would be punished by imprisoment for any term less than his natural life, then such person must be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not less than the longest term, nor more than twice the longest term prescribed upon a first conviction.
The appellant, upon his conviction, was sentenced to imprisonment for life, and the question presented upon this appeal, and indeed it is the only question that requires consideration, is whether the punishment inflicted was justified by existing statutes. The proposition that the Penal Code is ex post act of in reference to the offense of which the appellant was convicted,' cannot be maintained, though at first blush there seems to be some force in it. But upon reflection it is quite apparent that it has no strength. The legislature has the right to declare the punishment for a stated offense. They have done so by the Penal Code. It is substantially that if a person who has been convicted within this state, of a felony, commits any crime within this state, he is punishable upon conviction of such second offense in the manner indicated ; that is to say, if the second offense is such that upon a first conviction of it he might be punished, in the discretion of the court, by imprisonment for life, he must be sentenced to imprisonment in the state prison for life for such subsequent crime. If the appellant therefore had been convicted either under the Revised Statutes or under the Penal Code, of the offense of forgery in the first degree, inasmuch as he might be punished by imprisonment for life, he must under the provisions of the Code be sentenced to imprisonment in the state prison for life. If the section which contains these provisions, namely, section 688, before alluded to, required that the subsequent crime should be similar in degree to the first offense, there might be some reason to declare in this case, that as the first offense was one which was not punishable in the discretion of the court by imprisonment for life, the sentence was erroneous. But such is neither the letter nor the spirit of the law, the declaration being, as already suggested, that if any person convicted of a felony within this state commits any crime, then he may be punished as indicated in the section.
There is no imposition of any punishment for the first offense, but an increased punishment for a second offense of a felony whatever that felony may be, if within the provisions of the statute. In other words the statute is substantially this: A person who has been convicted of a felony within this state, who commits any crime within the state, shall be punished as follows: If the second offense is such, that upon a first conviction of it he might be punished in the discretion of the court, by imprisonment for life, he must be sentenced to imprisonment for life. This feature of the statute is a method of regulating and determining the extent of the sentence for the second offense, which is increased when a previous felony is shown to have been committed by the accused. The statute embraces any felony, the design evidentally being to punish severely for a second felony, and to declare absolutely the punishment by abrogating the discretion as to the term which might otherwise be designated. In sentencing for the second offense the discretion does not exist therefore.
In the consideration of this question, it must not be forgotten that the offense of which the prisoner was convicted was committed after the Penal Code went into effect; and there - fore he is not punished under the Code for an act committed before it went into effect. The legislature in determining what punishment should be inflicted for the commission of forgery in the first degree have declared that the maximum shall be imposed in cases where the crime is a second offense, though not of the same degree as the first. For these reÃ¡sons we think the judgment should be affirmed.

1167724,MATTER OF GRAY,1884-01,"Westbrook, J.
The relator, John H. Gray, who is now detained in the Albany county penitentiary under a warrant of commitment from James V. Smith, a justice of the peace of the town of Greenfield, in the county of Saratoga, asks to be relieved from such imprisonment, upon the ground that the commitment shows no offense known to the law.
The commitment recites that Gray was, on the 10th day of December, 1883, arraigned before a court of Special Sessions held by James V. Smith, a justice of the peace in the town of Greenfield, Saratoga county, to answer for the crime of â€?assault and battery committed on Norman Potter,â€?and having been â€?convicted of said offense,â€?the court adjudged and determined that Gray should be committed to the Albany county penitentiary, there to be kept at hard labor for the term of four months.
It is insisted on behalf of the relator as the principal ground for the discharge, that there is now no such crime known to the law as â€?assault and battery,â€?as the offense formerly known by that name is now, by the Penal Code, styled and designated an â€?assault in the third degree.â€?A reference to section 219 of the Penal Code shows that the terms 11 assault â€?and â€?assault and battery â€?have not become obsolete, because that section provides that â€?a person who commits an assault or an assault and battery ... is guilty of an assault iu the third degree.â€?It is true that an assault and battery may be committed under such circumstances as to amount to a graver crime than an assault in the third degree. Penal Code, Â§Â§ 217, 218. In charging the graver offenses, however, the commission of the acts marking them must be averred. An allegation of a simple assaulting and beating, and a conviction thereof, is only a statement of a charge and conviction of a simple assault and battery, which by the Penal Code is declared to be â€?an assault in the third degree.â€?The point then urged in behalf of the defendant is, that although the commitment has described the act of which the defendant has been convicted in the very language which the statute has used to mark and designate the crime of an assault in the third degree, yet, as the crime has not also been called by its technical name, his detention is illegal.
This position cannot be sound, because the Code itself, by using the same language in defining an assault in the third degree, makes it clear that the description of the offense in the commitment is one well known to the law. It cannot be at all important that the crime shown by the commitment should be called by its technical name, provided the description therein of the act which constitutes the offense is clear and precise, and leaves no doubt as to its exact character. No more accurate statement of the one committed by the defendant can be given than that contained in the warrant of commitment, because it is therein alleged that the defendant was charged with the commission of the very act or acts which the section referred to declares to be an assault in the third degree, and was duly convicted of the perpetration thereof. It distinctly states that the defendant was duly charged with an â€?assault and battery committed on Norman Potter,â€?and that he was â€œconvicted of said offense,â€?which is only declaring that he was, according to law, convicted of the crime of assaulting and beating Norman Potter, upon which conviction he was sentenced to imprisonment. As there is no allegation in the warrant of anything more than a simple assault and battery, we know that the crime committed, and on account of which the defendant is enduring punishment, is an assault in the third degree, as that offense is defined by the Code.
A reference also to the record of conviction shows that the crime which the defendant committed, and which in both the warrant of commitment and record is called â€?an assault and battery on Norman Potter,â€?was properly so designated, for in describing the act called as assault and battery, it is further stated to have been committed by â€?striking and punching â€?the complainant, Norman Potter, several times with a stick, and that after having been duly arraigned upon such charge, and having pleaded not guilty, the â€?defendant was convicted of the charges above specified.â€?There is no allegation in the record that the beating was charged to have inflicted â€?grievous bodily harm,â€?nor that he was convicted of any such beating so as to make it an assault in the second degree. Penal Code, section 218. It therefore shows a conviction for a simple assaulting and beating with a stick, which is included and covered by the definition of what the Code terms and calls an â€?assault in the third degree,â€?It was said upon the argument that the very point involved in this proceeding had been decided in the city of New York by Judge Barrett, who held that a commitment for an assault and battery could not be sustained. Such decision, if made, is of course entitled to great respect. Of the mode, however, in which the question was there presented, or of the reasons given to sustain it, no information was furnished. If the case in which the decision was made was similar to the present, it cannot be adopted as sound. When the warrant of commitment, in statingthe offense of which a prisoner has been convicted, uses the very language of the Penal Code in its definition of an assault in the third degree, and when such language, apart from the Code defines a crime well known to the law, and when the record of conviction by its more particular recital of the facts of the offense, also shows that the crime called in the Code assault in the third degree, has been committed, it would be very technical and narrow to adjudge that because the name by which the offense is now known, is not also used, that therefore the conviction and detention cannot be upheld. The right to detain depends upon the proper conviction of the defendant, of acts which constitute the crime, and when he has been adjudged guilty of such acts and been condemned to punishment therefor, all of which is fully set out in the commitment, he should not be discharged, because in addition to a complete statement of the act which he had been convicted of perpetrating, the committing magistrate did not further state the legal conclusion from the facts averred, that the technical name of the crime which the commission of such acts evinced, was an assault in the third degree. In determining whether or not an individual is guilty of a particular offense, we ask, has he committed the act or acts, which in law make and mark the crime ? The sufficiency of a commitment should be judged by the same rule; and when such an instrument shows a conviction for doing that which is a criminal offense, to hold it void, merely because it omits to give, in addition to the statement showing a due and regular conviction for the perpetration of such acts, the technical name of such offense, is the exaltation of form above substanceâ€”the requirement of a name, and the rejection of a description equally exact. A pleading which avers legal conclusions and not facts, is bad. While this rule would not condemn a warrant of commitment, or a record of conviction, as bad, which stated a conviction for a crime by its technical name, without detailing the act or acts constituting it, yet the principle upon which such rule depends is certainly at variance with the hyper-criticism which declares null and incapable of enforcement a judgment of imprisonment rendered upon a conviction for perpetrating certain deeds making a crime, merely because such paper does not also declare that such acts mark a specific crime called by a certain name.
In charging an offense in an indictment, it has frequently been held that the exact words of the statute defining the offense need not be used ; that it is sufficient if words of a similar import to those used in the statute are employed. People v. Enoch, 13 Wend. 159; Fitzgerald v. People, 37 N. Y. 413.
The reasoning in the cases cited is applicable to the present. Though the crime of which the relator was convicted is not called by its technical name, it is described in language most unmistakable, and in the very words used in the statute to define the offense which the relator has committed. His discharge from imprisonment upon the ground that he has committed no offense known to the law, is clearly untenable, because an offense is plainly and clearly stated both in the commitment and record of conviction. Guilt or innocence of crime, as has previously been stated, depends upon the commission or non-commission by the accused of that which constitutes it. When a commitment shows that a person imprisoned has been, according to law, duly convicted of doing the thing which constitutes the crime, for the perpetration of which punishment is being inflicted, it is not at all important that such commitment should also designate the offense by its statute name.
For the reasons which have been given, the writ must be discharged, and the relator remanded to the custody of the keeper of the penitentiary.
Note.â€”As there is some misapprehension as to the decision of Justice Barrett (in People v. Keating) referred to on page 304, ante, the following opinion in People v. Maschke (decided 9 February, 1884), is given.
Barrett, J.
"" My decision upon a previous application was based upon what I understood to be a ruling of Mr. Justice Clement, of the City Court of Brooklyn. There seems, however, to be some doubt as to that ruling, there being no written opinion or statement of the precise facts, and consequently I have examined the question independently. If the judgment of the Special Sessions had simply convicted the prisoner of assault and battery, I -Should have no hesitation, even upon habeas corpus, in directing a discharge. There are assaults and batteries which are felonies as well as misdemeanors. I find, however, upon examining the copy judgment, that the prisoner whose case is now before me was convicted of the misdemeanor of assault and battery. This, I think, sufficiently describes the offense as assault in the third degree, though the precise statutory definition would have- been better. In its -lists of misdemeanors, the Code enumerates â€?assault in the third degree (Penal Code, Â§ 56, subdiv. 2), while the other degrees are treated as felonies. The misdemeanor of assault and battery is that assault and battery which is not a felony. The prisoner was, therefore, convicted of the assault and battery referred to in Â§ 219; that is the assault and battery not specified in the preceding sections, 217 and 218. In other words, of assault and battery which is not a felony, consequently of assault in the third degree. In my judgment, therefore, a conviction of â€?the misdemeanor of assault and battery â€?is equivalent to a conviction of â€?assault in the third degree.â€?As it thus appears that the court acted within its jurisdiction, the writ must be dismissed and the prisoner remanded.â€?This decision was affirmed by the General Term, ante, p. 168.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1167704,PEOPLE ex rel. EVANS v. McEWAN,1884-05,"Learned, P. J.
Upon the return having been made to a writ of habeas corpus, the court is to examine into the facts alleged in the return. Code Civ. Pro. Â§ 2031. If there is no traverse of those facts, they must be taken as true. Matter of Da Costa, 1 Park. Cr. 129 ; People ex rel. Catlin v. Neilson, 16 Hun, 214.
Therefore, in the present case we are to look at the return made to the writ, and not at the affidavits upon which the writ was obtained. Everything not admitted is expressly denied in the return. The return states that the superintendent holds the relator by virtue of a warrant, a copy of which is annexed, and by virtue of a judgment of conviction for the crime of assault in the third degree, by the recorder of Binghamton, etc.
The relator insists that the recorder had not jurisdiction to try the charge before himself summarily, but must sit as a court of Special Sessions (L. 1867, ch. 291, tit. 5, Â§ 7), and he insists that this trial was not before a court of Special Sessions. But the warrant expressly recites the holding of a court of Special Sessions and the trial of the relator at the same.
Next, the relator asserts that the recorder filed a certificate or record (see the section aforesaid and Code of Criminal Procedure, Â§ 724), and that such certificate shows that the recorder acted summarily and not as a court of Special Sessions.
To this we have to say that the return does not set forth the certificate, and there is no .admission that the certificate set forth in the petition is correct. Furthermore, on looking at section 7 above cited, the form is given which the certificate shall substantially have, when the recorder is sitting as a court of Special Sessions or otherwise. That form is followed in the copy set forth in the petition.
Next, it is said that section 725, Code Criminal Procedure, directs that the judgment be executed upon the sheriff, etc., receiving Ã¡ copy of the certificate, and that the warrant under which the relator is held is not a copy of the certificate.
Now it is pointed out in People ex rel. Trainor v. Baker, 89 N. Y. 460, that a prisoner who has been properly and legally sentenced to prison, cannot be released, simply because there is an imperfection in what is commonly called the mittimus ; that if the prisoner is safely in the proper custody, there is no office for a mittimus to perform. The return states that the prisoner was held by a judgment of conviction, etc. Now we are either to take that as true, in which case the prisoner is properly detained, or we must suppose that the certificate, of which a copy is attached to the petition, is assumed to be the certificate filed by the recorder. In that case, we have seen that the form is substantially according to that set forth in section 7 above recited.
One further objection is made. The certificate states that the prisoner pleaded guilty, and proceeds, â€?whereupon said recorder, upon such conviction, did sentence,â€?etc., and the objection is taken that neither the certificate nor the warrant, after stating a plea of guilty, do in so many words say that the prisoner was convicted. The papers only mention the conviction by way of recital. We think that this objection is hypercritical. After a plea of guilty, there is nothing further for a court to do than to pronounce sentence. The plea of guilty is like the verdict of guilty. Code Crim. Pro. Â§ 471.
There is no duty in the court to â€?convict,â€?but only to sentence. If the prisoner pleaded not guilty, and if he were tried without a jury, then the court would find him guilty or not guilty; but when he pleads guilty, there is nothing for the court to find.
To this effect is section 717 of the Code Criminal Procedure, â€?When a defendant pleads guilty, or is convicted, either by the court or by a jury.â€?This shows that when he pleads guilty it is not necessary that there should be any conviction. The subsequent section, 722, gives a form which need only be followed substantially.
We think the order appealed from should be reversed, and the prisoner remanded to the penitentiary.

1167700,PEOPLE v. PECK,1884-03,"Daniels, J.
The indictment charged the defendant with the offense of obtaining money by means of false pretences. It was objected to as defective for failing to comply with sections 275 and 276 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The demurrer specified three objections in which the indictment was deemed to be defective. These objections were stated in the following manner:
1. That the indictment does not show that it was found by a grand jury, nor that it is indorsed by the foreman of the grand jury.
2. That the indictment does not contain the title of the action specifying the name of the court to which the indictment is presented, and the names of the parties as required by section 275 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
3. That this indictment does not conform substantially to the requirements of sections 275 and 276 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The objection that it was not found by a grand jury, is answered by the first paragraph of the indictment itself, which states its presentment by the jurors of the people of the state of New York, in and for the body of the city and county of. New York, which has for many years, prior to the enactment of this Code, been followed, as an appropriate designation of the grand jury, and their action in the presentment of indictments. And while the Code has changed the phraseology to be made use of in an accusation of crime by the grand jury, there was no substantial departure from that formality in the presentment of this indictment.
For the defendant was as effectually and intelligently accused of the crime charged by the phrase that the jurors upon their oath made the presentment following this formal paragraph, as she would have been if the word â€?accuse â€?had been used in place of the word â€?present.â€?By the form which was followed no substantial departure was made from that which the Code itself has prescribed.
The averment that the indictment was not indorsed by the foreman of the grand jury is answered by the indorsement appearing upon the bill, by which it was stated to be â€?a true bill, George G. Fisher, Foreman.â€?The indictment did not contain the title of the action, or a statement of the court in which it was found and presented, but it appeared by the record made a part of it, that the grand jury was organized in the court of j General Sessions, and appeared in court and presented the indictment in the case of People against Ellen E. Peck.
While these were not formal compliances with what the Code of Criminal Procedure requires in an indictment, the omissions made no substantial change to the prejudice of the defendant in the indictment. For it was entirely clear that it was found by a grand jury in the court of General Sessions of the county of New York, and in the case of the people against the present defendant. And by the express provisions of the Code contained in section 285, it has been declared that â€?no indictment is insufficient, nor can the trial, judgment or other proceeding thereon be affected by reason of an imperfection in matter of form which does not tend to the prejudice of the substantial rights of the defendant upon the merits.â€?No prejudice whatever could result to the defendant by reason of either of the defects in the indictment, and by the direct language of this section of the Code the court has been required to disregard them.
The indictment itself contains a very full, as well as a minute statement of the representations charged to have been made, the fact that they were false and that moneys were obtained by reason of them by the defendant, from the person to whom the representations were addressed. In these respects it is much more full and complete than the present Code of Criminal Procedure required it should be. There was, accordingly, no defect of substance in the indictment itself. It did charge a criminal offense with more detail and more particularity than that which is now required to be made by the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The demurrer which was presented to the indictment depended for its validity upon the first, second and fourth subdivisions of section 323 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. But it is not supported by these subdivisions, for it did not appear on the face of the indictment that the grand jury by which it was found, had no legal authority to inquire into the crime charged, by reason of its not being within the local jurisdiction of the county. Neither did it appear that the indictment did not conform substantially to the requirements of sections 275, 276 of this Code ; neither did it fail to state facts which constituted a crime. These were substantially the objections which were taken, and in support of them, mere in-formalities have been pointed out, presenting no substantial failure to conform to the requirements of the sections declaring the form and frame of the indictment. The same observation is equally as applicable to the substance of the indictment itself, for it does certainly contain a statement of facts constituting the crime alleged to have been committed by the defendant.
The judgment by which the demurrer was sustained was erroneous, and it should be reversed, and the defendant required to plead to the indictment.

1167702,PEOPLE v. WHEDON,1884-05,"Smith, P. J.
It is enacted by section 217 of the Penal Code, that a person who, with an intent to kill a human being, assaults another with a loaded firearm, or any other deadly weapon, or by any other means or force likely to produce death, is guilty of assault in the first degree. The indictment in this case charges that the defendant, with force and arms, feloniously made an assault upon John Cross, and â€?to, at, towards and against him, the said John Cross, a certain pistol, then and there loaded and charged with gunpowder and lead, which the said Theron Whedon, in his hand, then and there, had and held, the same being then and there likely to produce death, willfully and feloniously did then and there shoot off and discharge, with intent, him, the said John Cross, then and there feloniously and willfully to kill,â€?&c.
These averments constitute an offense as defined by the statute above cited. It is not necessary that the pleader should use the very words of the statute. A pistol is a fire-arm, and the act of discharging a loaded pistol â€?at, towards and against,â€?another, with intent to kill him, is an offense within the provision of the statute, construed, as the Code requires â€?according to the fair import of their terms, to promote justice and effect the objects of the law.â€?Pen. Code, Â§ 11. We think the indictment was sufficient, and the demurrer was properly overruled. The demurrer having been overruled, the defendant pleaded not guilty, and added specifications of insanity. Code Crim. Proc. Â§ 336. At the trial, a witness, Jacob Simms, called for the defendant, testified that he knew the prisoner, and that the prisoner worked for witness some months before the shooting. The witness was then asked whether he observed anything peculiar in regard to his conduct. He answered, â€?Y es, I discovered something different from what I expected.â€?The defendantâ€™s counsel then said, â€?I will offer to prove acts and conditions indicating unsoundness of mind, for the purpose of the light it sheds on the true state of his mind at a previous time. We offer to prove that at that time he was insane. We offer to prove his acts and conduct while in the employ of the witness for the purpose of showing his insanity.â€?This was objected to as incompetent and improper; the objection was sustained, and the evidence excluded, and the prisonerâ€™s counsel excepted.
It will be observed that the objection was not that the evidence was too remote, nor was it excluded on that ground; it was shut out, as the record states, as being incompetent and improper; but why incompetent and improper, if not too remote ? The offer was to show facts and not opinions. The testimony may have thrown light upon the state of the prisonerâ€™s mind at the time of the offense, and thus have borne directly upon the issue. Even if the exclusion had been put upon the ground of the remoteness of the testimony, we would be doubtful of its correctness.
Evidence had been given, as the record states,' that the de-' fendant â€?had been dwelling upon supposed insults and indignities by Cross to defendantâ€™s female relatives ; had been subject to fits of weeping without apparent cause, and had been restless, nights; and on the occasion in questionâ€?(the shooting) â€?his eyes were wild and staring, his face purple, and his manner excited and violent; and there was evidence that he had a nervous temperament.â€?Besides, Dr. Totman, a physician, called as a witness by the defense, to whom the district attorney, on cross-examination, put a hypothetical question, based upon his version of the evidence, had answered that he should say the circumstances detailed in the question would be sufficient in his opinion to unsettle such a mind. In those circumstances we do not think it would have been proper to hold that an offer to show that the prisoner was insane â€?some months â€?before the shooting, was too remote. We think that in the ruling the learned county judge fell into an error, and it is impossible to say that the error did not prejudice the prisoner and affect the result.
As there must be a new trial for this reason, needless to examine the other questions in the case, it not being likely that they will arise on another trial.
The judgment and order upon the demurrer, and the order upon the motion in arrest affirmed, and the conviction and the judgment thereon, and the order denying a new trial reversed, and a new trial ordered in the court of Sessions of the county of Onondaga.

1167714,PEOPLE v. NORTON,1884-06,"Smith, P. J.
The judgment of the court of Special Sessions was rendered under sections 719 and 720 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the only question is, whether an apwill lie from such judgment to the court of Sessions. If the right of appeal exist in this case, it must be found in section 749 of said Code, which provides that â€?a .judgment upon conviction, rendered by a court of Special Sessions, may be reviewed by the court of Sessions of the county, upon an appeal as prescribed by this title, and not otherwise.â€?Is the judgment of the Special Sessions in this case a judgment â€?upon conviction,â€?within the meaning of section 749 ? We think not. A â€?judgment upon a conviction,â€?as the words are used in the Code of Criminal Procedure, can only be rendered against a person charged with the commission of a criminal offense, or the defendant in a criminal prosecution. In that sense they are used repeatedly in the Code. It is absurd to say that the prosecutor in a criminal proceeding, when charged with the costs of the prosecution, by reason of having instituted it without probable cause, or even maliciously, is convicted of a crime. We think it clear that an appeal from a judgment of that nature does not lie to the court of Sessions. Whether it can be taken to the County Court, under sections 3044 and 3045 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as suggested by the respondentâ€™s counsel, is a question not before us, and upon which we express no opinion.
It may well be that the legislature intended to provide no appeal from judgments of this nature, as they do not involve the merits of the prosecution, and the amount of costs chargeable upon a prosecutor in a court of Special Sessions, can never be large.
The order appealed from should be affirmed, but as the question is new, without costs.

1167719,PEOPLE ex rel. SCHERER v. WALSH,1884-09,"Pratt, J.
This is a proceeding by certiorari to review in this court the decision and rulings of a police justice. The decision and rulings sought to be reviewed were given upon a trial before the justice, upon a complaint made against Conrad Scherer by his wife, the relator herein, for abandonment. The justice refused to admit certain testimony offered on behalf of this relator and dismissed the complaint. The charge was made under section 899 of Code of Criminal Procedure, subd. 1, and the first question to be disposed of is whether the action .of the magistrate can be reviewed by certiorari.
By section 515 of Code, of Criminal Procedure, writs of certiorari in criminal actions, as they have heretofore existed are abolished, and a review had by an appeal; but this section refers only to criminal actions as defined in that Code. The proceeding before the magistrate was not strictly a criminal action, but was a special proceeding of a criminal nature, under part 6 of the Criminal Code, title .7. No right of appeal seems to be provided for under this part. of the Criminal Code, except under title 5â€”â€?Of proceedings respecting bastards.â€?And hence, section 515 abolishing writs of certiorari does not apply to part 6, but the law remains as it existed before the Criminal Code.
Section 515 in plain terms refers only to a judgment or order in a criminal action and not to a special proceeding of a criminal nature. This distinction is rendered more apparent by referring to title 2, part 6, of the Criminal Code, sections 950, 951 and 952. It is clear therefore that no right of appeal was given by the Code to either party in this proceeding. It cannot be claimed that an appeal was authorized by section 749, which provides for appeals from judgments rendered by a court of Special Sessions.
It is true the defendant entitled the proceedings as in Special Sessions, but that did not affect the rights of the parties.
The proceedings were not in a court of Special Sessions, but were before the defendant as police justice.
There is a marked distinction between courts of Special Sessions and courts held by police justices under special provisions of law both in the Constitution and the Code of Criminal Procedure. People v. Trumble, 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 443. It was also held in People v. Burleigh (same volume, 522, 523), that where authority is conferred upon a particular officer or magistrate giving to him special jurisdiction in a criminal matter with special directions as to the mode of procedure, he must be deemed to act as an officer and not as a court of Special Sessions.
This principle is decisive in this case.
Section 900 gave special jurisdiction to a police justice with special directions as to the mode of procedure, and the justice must be deemed to have acted as an officer and not as a court of Special Sessions.
The writ of certiorari is therefore a proper remedy under which to review the proceedings.
We also think the defendant erred in excluding testimony showing it was unsafe for the wife to remain in the house with the accused. There is no rule of law requiring a wife to remain under the roof of a brute, in constant danger of life and limb, under pain of starvation. It was, therefore, competent for the relator to show that she had reasonable cause to leave the house where she was in imminent danger of suffering personal violence at the hands of her husband.
If this testimony had been received, the offense of which the accused was charged would have been clearly made out under the statute.
This statute has been under the consideration of this court since its amendment and its provisions fully discussed. People ex rel. Douglass v. Naeher, 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 513.
The decision of the police justice must be vacated and set aside, without costs.

1167698,PEOPLE v. DURRIN,1884-10,"Potter, J.
The defendant was indicted for the crime of bigamy at a term of this court held in Warren county on September 13, 1883. The indictment charges that the defendant on February 25, 1869, married Mary Wallace, and that on July 7, 1877, he married Eunice T. Tuesdale, and that the said Mary Wallace to whom he was first married, was alive on said July 7, 1877.
To this indictment the defendant demurred upon the ground that the indictment contained matter which, if true, would constitute a -legal bar to the prosecution, in this: that^it charged the said crime of bigamy to have been committed on July 27, 1877, and it shows the said indictment to have been found on September 13, 1883, a period of more than five years after the alleged crime was committed. The first question is whether the defense of the statute of limitations to the crime charged in this indictment, can be presented by way of a demurrer. I may say at the outset that the authorities upon this question are by no means numerous, and those to be found in the states where the question had been raised, are not uniform.
It will not be questioned that under the Code of Civil Procedure, as well as under the system of pleading which prevailed before the adoption of that Code, a defendant could not demur to the complaint, upon the ground that the statute of limitations had run upon the demand, where such fact appeared upon the face of the complaint. The Objection that the cause of action-was barred by the statute of limitations, must be raised by answer. Sands v. St. John, 36 Barb. 628, and the cases referred to in the opinion in that case.
It was also held in numerous cases that by both systems of pleadings in civil actions, it was not proper to allege in a complaint any facts to avoid the statute of limitationsâ€”such as that the defendant has not resided in the state within six years before the commencement of the action. Lefferts v. Hollister, 10 How. Pr. 383; Butler v. Mason, 16 Id. 546. The object and purpose of pleadings in civil and criminal actions are substantially- the same. They are to produce material issues of fact or of law, and to provide the most convenient and approved modes of trying the issues. While the rules are not always the same in civil as in criminal actions, yet, where a cause of action and Ã¡ criminal offense are or may be barred by a statute of limitations and the operation of the statute of limitations is avoided in both cases by the same fact or condition, I apprehend, the rule or modes of pleading such fact or condition should be substantially the same. 1 Bish. Crim. Pro. Â§ 321.
This, no doubt, is the general rule ; but at the same time it is subject to exception or modification by any well considered precedent to the contrary, by a court of the same state as that in which the question may subsequently arise, or the appositeness of the matter to the allegations of the complaint and indictment, or by the completeness of the analogy between the matters, which avoids the operation of the defense in a civil or criminal action.
The operation of the statute of limitations in this state is suspended in both civil and criminal actions by the absence of the- defendant from the state. In civil actions we have seen that the statute of limitations cannot be presented by demurrer but must be by answer, and that it is not correct pleading to allege in the complaint the matter which would suspend the operation of that statute. Lefferts v. Hollister supra ; Butler v. Mason, supra. Accordingly, we do not find a criminal case in this state, in which a demurrer to an indictment, showing that the period of limitation had expired after the time of the commission of the crime, and before the finding and filing of the indictment for such crime.
The case of People v. Roe, 5 Parker, 231, was a case where it appeared upon the face of the indictment that the offense was committed some twelvÃ© years before the indictment therefor was found, and the defendant interposed a plea of the statute of limitations.
In People v. Van Stanvoord, 9 Cow. 655, the indictment charged that the crime was committed more than three years before the indictment was found. The defendant pleaded not guilty, and upon a trial was convicted notwithstanding the statute of limitations upon a motion in arrest upon the ground that the statute had run against the offense, as appeared from the record, the conviction was sustained.
The court held that the day laid in the indictment must be regarded as immaterial for all purposes, and that it was tp be intended after conviction that the offense found upon the trial was within the three years.
If a motion in arrest of a judgment showing upon its face that the statute of limitations had run upon the offense when the indictment was found, would not avail to reverse the conviction, how should a demurrer to an indictment alleging the offense to have been committed more than the period of limitation, defeat the prosecution ?
The time alleged is not material and the prosecution would be allowed to depart from the time alleged and prove the time of the commission of the offense was within the period of limitation. As was said by the court in 9 Cow. supra, after conviction it would be intended that the offense proved was within the then three years, so Kin case of a demurrer where the time alleged is without the period, the prosecution will be allowed to prove the offense was committed within the time. Pursuing the same line of reasoning, it has been held that a motion to quash an indictment, upon the ground that its allegations showed the offense was committed without the period of limitations, would be denied. United States v. Cook, 17 Wallace, 179. The reason assigned for such holding is that â€?such a proceeding would deprive the prosecutor of the right to reply or give evidence that the defendant fled from justice and was within the exception or suspension of the statute.
A demurrer upon that ground to such an indictment is subject to the same objection for it would practically hold the prosecutor to a time which is immaterial, and always variable by proof.
Bishop in his work upon criminal proceedings, at section 741, says, Â£ But this plea, demurrer, is not very frequently resorted to in practice, since the defendant may take advantage of the same exceptions after a conviction, by motion in arrest of judgment.â€?But it has been held in People v. Van Santvoord that a motion in arrest of judgment upon that ground appearing in the record will not avail to reverse the conviction.
hTor can the indictment in this case be brought within the principle applicable to a class of offenses which are so defined by the statute that an exception forms a part of the indictment or is so incorporated into the clause of the statute in relation to the offense as to form a part of the crime.
In such case the pleader should set out the offense and the exception, affirming the offense and negativing the exception.
But if the language of the statute defining the offense is so distinct from the exception as to be in separate or subsequent statutes, or that in stating or describing the offense, no statement or preference to the exception is necessary or proper, the indictment may omit such exception or any reference to it. United States v. Cook, supra.
I am not inclined to the opinion that the statute of limitations is of the nature or character of an exception as exceptions are treated and discussed in pleadings.
But if the statute of limitations was of that nature, it is not mentioned in the enactment or clause of the statute in relation to the crime of bigamy, nor in any manner referred to in that statute.
The enactment of the statute in relation to bigamy was along time before the present statute of limitations, and has been substantially re-enacted since the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations applicable to the offense in this case was not only enacted at a different time, but is contained in a different statute, from a statute in relation to bigamy, and is applicable not alone to the crime of bigamy, but is applicable to all offenses save murder and a few offenses for which special limitations are provided. Code Crim. Pro. Â§ 142.
My conclusion is that by the decisions of this state, as well as by the decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court (17 Wallace, supra), and by the text writers (Ball on Lim. 209-216; Bishop's Crim. Pro. 2nd ed. Â§Â§ 465, 632, 638, 639 and 743 ; Wharton Am. Crim. Law, 4th ed. Â§ 445), a demurrer upon the ground of the statute of limitations is not a proper plea.
It is true as before stated that the decisions in some of the other states are in conflict with the rule which I think prevails in this state and in the U. S. Supreme Court. Among such decisions will be found, State v. Ryan, 10 Louisiana, 435; People v. Miller, 12 Cal. 294; McLane v. State, 4 Georgia, 340.
The only remaining question is whether the Code of Criminal Procedure or Penal Code has changed the rule, or the conclusion I have reached. As before remarked, these two Codes are in different statutes, and were passed by the legislature at different times. The definition of the crime charged in the indictment by the former statute is the same or substantially the same as in the Penal Code.
Has the Code of Criminal Procedure changed the rule of pleading, or does the due administration of criminal justice or the rights and the protection of persons charged with the commission of crime require a different rule or practice than prevailed under the former law %
As we have seen from precedents in this and other states, the defense of the statute of limitations could be presented by a special plea in bar (5 Parker, supra), or such defense can be well made under the plea of not guilty. 17 Wallace, supra; People v. Van Santvoord, 9 Cow. opinion of Judge Spencer, 660 ; Code Crim. Pro. Â§ 339. By this section all matters of fact tending to establish a defense, except a former judgment of conviction or acquittal of the crime charged, may be given in evidence under the plea of not guilty. Indeed, these are the only special pleas now allowed to an indictment.
There would now be no propriety in a special plea of the statute of limitations for the reason that such defense can be proved under the general issue of not guilty, and there is no reply allowed to the prosecution. Hence no more definite or pointed issue of fact to the statute of limitations could be formed than results from the plea of not guilty, and the evidence that may be given under it, in relation to such defense.
By section 323, Code of Criminal Procedure, the defendant may demur to the indictment upon the several grounds specified in that section. The ground presented by the demurrer in this case is, that the indictment contains matter, which if true, constitutes a legal bar to the prosecution. The indictment in effect charges that the defendant committed the crime of bigamy on July 27,1877. By section 143 Code of Criminal Procedure, it is provided that no time during which the defendant is not an inhabitant of or usually resident within the state is a part of the limitation.
How the indictment is entirely silent upon the subject of residence within or without the state.
The defendant may or may not have been an inhabitant, or a usual resident within the state for a day after the commission of the crime. If he was not, the statute has not run against the prosecution of the crime, and the defendant has no defense upon that ground.
It is essential to the running of the statute that the defendant should have been within the state.
Whether he was within or without the state does not appear from the indictment and hence it cannot be claimed that the indictment contains matter which is a legal bar. All the matters contained in the indictment may be true and yet not be a legal bar for the reason that the defendant has not been within the state since the crime was committed. Hence the indictment does not contain matter which, if true, would constitute a legal bar to the prosecution.
In order to be a bar, the defendant must have been within the state for the period of the limitation and that fact does not appear upon the face of the indictment.
The demurrer must be overruled, but the defendant is allowed to plead, or in default of so doing, a plea of not guilty to be entered for him.
Note.â€”In Fleming v. People, 27 N. Y. 329, it was held that an indictment for bigamy need not negative the exceptions of the statute, although they are referred to in the section defining the offense, and that as a matter of pleading as well as of proof it lies upon the defendant to bring himself within the exceptions.
An indictment which shows that the offense was committed beyond the period of the statutory bar is good on demurrer. Gill v. State, 38 Ark. 524.
In Tennessee it has been held that the indictment should show some time within the statute of limitations. State v. Gibbs, 6 Baxt. 338.
It is not necessary that the exception be contained in the enacting clause; if it constitute a part of the definition of the offense. Territory v. Scott, 2 Dak. T. 212.
See Harris v. White, 81 N. Y. 532. Such negative averments should be set forth, even though the burden of proving that negative may be on the defendant. State v. Meek, 70 Mo. 355 ; 35 Amer. Rep. 427.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1167686,PEOPLE v. RHINELANDER,1884-10,"Smyth, Recorder.
The defendant stands indicted for assault in the first degree upon John Drake, with a pistol, on June 19, 1884.
Upon his being arraigned upon this indictment, two affidavits were presented to the court, made by Doctors McDonald and Hardy, respectively, each of whom state that they had made a personal examination into the mental condition of the defendant, and that in their opinion he was then insane.
The court thereupon refused to permit him to plead to the indictment, and subsequently ordered that a commission, consisting of Messrs. Edward Patterson, Doctor W. Detmold and Patrick HolÃ¡n, be appointed to examine the defendant and report to the court as to his sanity at the time of such examination.
This order was mp.de in pursuance of section 658 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. â€?The commissioners, having qualified by taking the necessary oath, proceeded summarily to examine the defendant, and in the course of such examination took the testimony of a large number of witnesses, and also that of the. defendant himself, and all the evidence was reduced to writing by the commissioners.
A report upon the facts, signed by Messrs. Detmold and Nolan, together with separate written opinions by all of the commissioners, has been presented to the court.
By this report and the opinions filed with it, it appeal's that Messrs. Detmold and Nolan concur in finding, as matter of fact, that the defendant is insane, and that he has not sufficient capacity to plead to the indictment or to undertake his defense. And they further state in the opinions filed by them, that to permit the defendant to be at large would be dangerous to the public peace and safety.
In the opinions filed by each of these gentlemen they state the reasons which induced them to arrive at the conclusions stated in their report.
Mr. Patterson, in the opinion presented, by him, after reviewing the evidence upon which the report of his colleagues is based, arrives at the conclusion, and states it as his opinion, that the defendant, so far as the purposes of the investigation made by the commission, and with the view of determining whether or not the defendant shall be tried, is a sane man.
A motion is now made upon this report and the several opinions of the commissioners accompanying it, by the district attorney (in which motion the counsel for the relatives of the defendant joins), for an order suspending the trial of the indictment until the defendant shall become sane, and if upon the report and opinions of the two concurring commissioners the court shall be of the opinion that the discharge of the defendant would be dangerous to the public peace or safety, that he be committed by the sheriff to a state lunatic asylum, to be dealt with in the manner provided by the Code of Criminal Procedure.
This motion is resisted by the defendant, through his counsel, upon various grounds. The only one which it is deemed necessary to pass upon is that the findings contained in the report do not sustain the opinion formed by the two concurring commissioners, and that the evidence taken upon the examination does not sustain the finding upon the question of the defendantâ€™s mental condition, but, on the contrary, it is insisted that the finding is clearly against the weight of the evidence, including that of the defendant himself, and that the evidence conclusively establishes the fact that the defendant was not at the time of his examination, and never has been, insane, bnt that he is in all respects mentally capable of understanding the nature of the charges for which he stands indicted and of undertaking his defense thereto.
The people and the counsel for the relatives of the defendant insist that the findings of the majority of the commission upon the question of the defendantâ€™s sanity at the time of the examination upon that question is conclusive, and that the .court must, by its order, suspend the trial of the defendant upon the indictment until such time as he shall become sane, pursuant to the requirements of section 659 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and that by the provisions of that section the court is deprived of the power to review the action of the commission, and that it has no discretion as to suspending the trial .of the indictment.
An examination of both these sectionsâ€”viz.: 658 and 659â€?is thus rendered necessary for the purposes of arriving at the intention of the legislature, and of ascertaining what power, if any, the court has over the report of the commission.
Section 658 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that when a defendant pleads insanity (which he is permitted to do by way of specification to the plea of not guilty by section 336 of said Code) the court in which the indictment is pending, instead of proceeding with the trial of the indictment, may appoint a commission of not more than three disinterested persons to examine the defendant and report to the court as to his sanity at the time of the commission of the crime.
It is further provided by the same section, that if a defendant under indictment appears to be, at any time before or after (conviction, insane, the court, unless he is under sentence of -death, may appoint a like commission to examine him and report to the court as to his sanity at the time of the examination.
The examination in either case must proceed in a summary â– manner, and before commencing it the commissioners are required to take the oath required by section 1016 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to be taken by referees.
The commission must be attended by the district attorney of the county, and may call and examine witnesses and enforce their attendance, and the counsel of the defendant may take part in the proceedings, and when the examination is concluded, they are required forthwith to report the facts to the court, with their opinion thereon. Section 659 provides that if the commission find the defendant insane the trial or judgment must be suspended until he becomes sane, and the court, if it deems his discharge dangerous to the public peace or safety, must order that he be in the meantime committed by the sheriff to a state lunatic asylum, and that upon his becoming sane he be redelivered by the superintendent of the asylum to the sheriff.
The examination secondly provided for by section 658, is clearly intended as a means whereby the court in which the indictment is pending may be informed as to whether or not the defendant is, at the time of the examination, by reason of idiocy, imbecility, insanity or lunacy, incapable of understanding the proceedings, or of making his defense to such proceedings, and for that purpose the court, in its discretion, is permitted to inquire into the matter by means of a commission of not exceeding three disinterested persons, to be appointed by the court.
At common law the trial, the sentencing or the punishment of an insane person for a crime, while he continued in that state, was prohibited, and the court in which an indictment was pending might, by aid of a jury, or by other discreet and proper methods in the discretion of the court, inquire into and determine the question of the sanity of such person.
And by the statutes of this state (2 R. S. 697, Â§ 2) the trial, sentencing or punishment of an insane person for a crime, while he remained in that state, was prohibited, and in the case of Freeman v. People (4 Denio, 9), it was held that as the statute then in force did not state in what manner the fact of insanity should be ascertained, that that fact was to be ascertained as the common law provided.
Other statutes were subsequently passed by the Legislature of this state, making provisions for the examination into, and the disposition of the cases of persons alleged to be insane, and who are under indictment for certain criminal acts specified in the statute, by which the court of Oyer and Terminer was authorized to appoint a commission for the purpose of inquiring in a summary manner into the sanity and the degree of mental capacity possessed by such person.
The commission thus authorized was required to inquire into the facts of the case, and report thereon to the court, and provides that if the court found such person insane or not of sufficient mental capacity to undertake his defense, it might by order remand him to a lunatic asylum, there to remain until he should be restored to his right mind (2 R. S., 7 ed. 1905, Â§ 20). And by section 20 of the Penal Code it is declared that an act done by a person who is an idiot, imbecile, lunatic, or of unsound mind, is not a crime, and that such a person cannot be tried, sentenced to any punishment, or punished for a crime, while he is in a state of idiocy, imbecility, insanity or lunacy, so as to be incapable of understanding the proceeding, or undertaking his .defense; but the statute expressly provides that a person in that condition is not excused from criminal liability, except upon proof that at the time he committed the alleged criminal act, he was laboring under such a defect of reason as either not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or to know that the act was wrong. Penal Code, Â§ 21.
A careful examination of the provisions of chapter 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and more particularly of sections 658 and 659 of that Code, has led me to the conclusion that there is no force in the grounds urged by the district attorney and the counsel, representing the relatives of the defendant.
In no part of this chapter, or in the section above referred to, does it appear that the power to determine the question as to whether or not a person was laboring under such a defect of reason as would excuse him from criminal liability for his act, or that by reason of idiocy, imbecility, insanity or lunacy, he was incapable of understanding the proceeding or making his defense, is conferred upon the commission, nor do I find any provision -which either takes from or in any way limits the power which has heretofore been exercised by criminal courts, both at common law and by statutes existing prior to the adoption of the Code, to inquire into such matters by and with the aid of a jury, or in such other way as may be found to be discreet and convenient. Sor do I find any provision which either in terms or by implication deprives the court, by whose order the inquiry and examination is made, of reviewing the proceedings, and adopting or rejecting the opinion or conclusions arrived at by the commission. The Legislature have expressly limited the power of the commission to an examination into the matter referred to them, and to report the result of their examination, with their opinion, to the court, and for the purpose of enabling them to do so, authority is conferred upon it to examine witnesses and compel their attendance. When the commission has exercised these powers their functions cease. No other authority or power is conferred upon the commission, nor can any authority be found in the statute conferring the power upon it to determine finally these questions.
If the Legislature intended to take away this power from the court, a power which it heretofore possessed, and which it was its duty to exercise, and to confer it upon a commission, it would have used such words in the statute as would clearly show the intention of the Legislature.
By requiring the commission to report the facts and their opinion upon the facts to the court, the Legislature intended that these facts and the opinions based upon them were for the information and guidance of the court in any subsequent proceeding which it might become necessary for the court to adopt.
The statute does not point out any way for reviewing the proceedings of the commission, nor is there any provision that I have been able to find contained in any of the statutes bearing upon the subject, and existing before the' adoption of the Code of Criminal Procedure, providing for a review of such proceedings. In the case of Freeman v. People (supra), it was held that a trial of the question of present insanity is a mere preliminary proceeding to the trial of the main issue of guilty or not guilty, and that the object of such a preliminary proceeding is simply to determine whether the person charged with an offense and alleged to be insane, shall be required to plead and proceed to the trial of the main issue. Exceptions are not authorized to be taken on such preliminary trial, and if errors occur they can only be corrected, as at common law, by the court which committed them.
It is insisted that by the use of the words â€?if the commission find the defendant insane,â€?in section 659, that the Legislature intended to confer upon the commission the power to determine finally the matter referred to them; and that by the words â€?the court must suspend the trial,â€?in the same section, all discretion which the court might otherwise exercise upon the question of suspending the trial is taken away, and that nothing remains to be done by the court but to order that the trialâ€”or judgment, if one be renderedâ€”be suspended until he becomes sane.
If this contention is right, and that to â€?find â€?is to determine the fact, without the intervention of the court and the right to review the finding when it is objected to, then it is apparent that section 559 is in direct conflict with section 658, which section confers upon the commission whatever power they possess, and expressly limits the commission to an examination, a report of the facts disclosed by such examination, and an opinion upon the facts.
Assuming, however, that these sections conflict, then it is the duty of the court to construe them together, and apply the well settled rules of construction, so as to arrive at what the intention of the Legislature was.
It is a sound principle, say the Court of Appeals in Townsley v. Hall (4 N. Y. 140), that such a construction ought to be put upon the statute as may best answer the intention which the makers had in view, and whenever the intention can be discovered it ought to be followed with reason and discretion in its construction, although such construction may seem contrary to the letter of the statute. -
Applying this rule to the sections in question, and construing them together, it seems very clear that the court has full power to review the proceedings of the commission, and adopt or reject their findings and opinions upon the question submitted to them as the evidence and the law may require. To adopt any other construction, and to give it the construction and effect which it is claimed by the people, ought to be given to my mind, would work very great injustice, which the Legislature never intended. To uphold the claim of the district attorney would be to deprive a defendant found by the report to be insane, and who is charged with the commission of a crime, of which he insists that he is not guilty, of the right to a speedy trial, which the constitution and law guarantees; and this when he insists that he is not, and never has been insane, and that the evidence taken by the commission, upon which their finding and opinions are based, would, upon a review by the court, establish his sanity and his mental capacity to understand the nature of the charge made against him, and of undertaking his defense thereto, and thereby save him from confinement and imprisonment in a lunatic asylum.
Having considered that the power of the court to review proceedings of this character, and to adopt or reject the conclusions and opinions of the commission is not taken away by the provisions of this statute, I have carefully examined the evidence and the findings, and the opinions of the commission, and after such examination I am constrained to' differ with the concurring commissioners in their finding and opinions as to the mental condition of the defendant at the time such elimination was made, and to concur with the views expressed, and in the conclusion arrived at, by Hr. Patterson in his dissenting opinion. The learned dissenting commissioner, after reviewing the evidence in respect to the claim that the defendant labors under insane delusions as to the relations and purposes of certain members of his family and Hr. Drake, to himself and his wife, and that in consequence of these delusions he is not capable of taking a rational view of his situation, and of properly considering the nature of the charge made against him, and the consequences it involves to himself, arrives at the conclusion that the defendantâ€™s mind is not controlled or dominated by delusions.
In this conclusion, and for the reasons so fully and ably expressed by the learned commissioner, I fully concur. The evidence is contained in two volumes, covering about 1,500 pages, and from that evidence it is clear to my mind that the defendant had some basis upon which to form a belief that Hr. Drake was assenting to an attempted separation of the defendant from his wife. Drakeâ€™s relations with the defendantâ€™s father and his family, taken with the fact that he accompanied Clarke to Canada, and the offer of a pecuniary reward to the wife.of the defendant to leave her husband in the early days of their marriage having been made by Clarke, furnish some grounds for that belief.
The citations of evidence made .by Hr. Patterson in his opinion, all of which I have verified, show that there was at least some grounds for the defendant to continue in the belief, or to claim that he believes, that there was a long continuing purpose on the part of his family, through Mr. Drake, to bring about the separation. I do not mean to say that Mr. Drake actually had such a purposeâ€”I merely refer to the view in which the defendant regarded it, or might claim to have regarded it. It is not necessary to refer to the defendantâ€™s motives in assaulting Mr. Drake. It is quite apparent, to my mind, that he had a motive and that the evidence before the commission disclosed it.
To comment upon the evidence at this stage of the proceeding might prejudice the rights of the defendant on the trial of the main issue. But it is proper to say that the evidence does not in any way complicate Mr. Drake in any improper relation with or intentions to the defendantâ€™s wife ; and it is due both to him and to her to say that neither transcended the strict lines of duty or propriety in their intercourse with each other, whatever it may have been.
I agree with the learned commissioner that the expert evidence is of no value in this investigation. While the physicians called by the people to sustain the allegation of insanity say that the defendant is insane, they differ radically among themselves as to the classification of that alleged insanity. Two say that he has general paresis; one says that he is an imbecile, and another that he suffers from melancholia. He can not have all these conditions at one and the same time; insanity in its initial stages and in its progressed stages cannot co-exist in the same person. But whatever may be the views of the learned experts, I have searched in vain through all this evidence to find any convincing proof of any one act of the defendant, during the period embraced in the examination, which itself proved insanity. Particular instances of foolish and impetuous acts, committed at long intervals, some of which being such as any self-willed or impulsive person might, under certain circumstances do, cannot prove actual unsoundness of mind, and a general judgment passed to-day upon the quality of an isolated act, committed years ago, is of but little value in determining a question of present sanity.
There is a singular deficiency of evidence of positive facts, indicating insanity, and as the learned Dr. Detmold says in his opinion, the expert evidence is â€?rather weak.â€?The record before me fully justifies the conclusion of Commissioner Patterson â€?that the defendant is a nervous, impulsive and self-willed person.â€?These are facts not of observation alonethey fully appear in evidence. His physical peculiarities are also testified to, but they are in many instances explained. Any one reading his cross-examination, which was mainly conducted by the learned and able counsel of his relatives (who it must be presumed was in possession of all the material facts relating to the life of the defendant), must be convinced that the defendant has an extraordinary memory, a clear and graphic power of expression, a coherent way of speaking and good judgment in answering perplexing questions, â€œand that he is for all the purposes of pleading and instructing counsel in the preparation and conduct of his defense, a sane man within the meaning and intent of the law.â€?The inquiry by the commission is limited by the statute to the ascertainment of the defendantâ€™s mental condition at the time of the examination, and is simply to determine whether he is in such a mental condition as to require him to plead and proceed to the trial of the main issue of guilty or not guilty, and it is immaterial, so far as this inquiry is concerned, what his mental condition was at the time of the commission of the alleged offense, except so far as it bore â€˜on his present mental condition. But if the inquiry which the commission was authorized to make into the defendantâ€™s mental condition at the time of the commission of the act alleged to be criminal, and the evidence, did sustain the claim of the learned district attorney and counsel for the relatives of the defendant, that he was then insane in consequence of delusions entertained by him, he would not be relieved from the consequences of his criminal act if the evidence satisfied a jury that he knew the nature and quality of the act alleged to be criminal, or that the act was wrongful. And in this present proceeding it is sufficient to put him to his defense, that the fact be established to the satisfaction of the court, that he is capable of rightly understanding his own condition, the nature of the charge against him, and of conducting his defense in a rational manner, and that fact appearing, he is not insane, within the meaning of the law, although on some subjects his mind might possibly be deranged. Freeman v. People 4 Denio, 9.
Entertaining these views, both upon the law and facts, it follows that the motion of the district attorney must be denied, and the defendant required to plead to the indictment.
Note.â€”Under a Wisconsin statute directing that the court shall in a summary manner make inquisition as to defendantâ€™s sanity, by a jury or otherwise, as it deems most proper, defendant has no right to a trial by jury of that question.

1167711,MATTER OF JACOBS,1884-10,"Davis, P. J.
Prior to the 12th day of May, 1884, Peter Jacobs, the appellant in this case, who is by occupation a manufacturer of cigars, carried on that business on the first floor of a tenement house in the city of New York in which he resided, and with his family occupied the whole of that floor, comprising seven rooms, in one of which he manufactured his cigars.
His business was a lawful one; but on the 12th of May, 1884, the Legislature passed an act making the manufacturing of cigars, &c., when carried on in such tenement houses as that occupied and used by the appellant, a criminal offense punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both. The tenement house in which Jaaobs manufactured his cigars was clearly within the description of the act; and the manufacture being continued by him after the 12th of May, in the same manner as before, he was, on the 14th â–?of that month arrested, on due complaint and warrant, and after examination committed in default of bail, by a police magistrate of the city. He sued out a writ of habeas corpus and of certiorari, on the return to which after due hearing, the Special Term of this court dismissed the writs and remanded the appellant. This appeal is taken from the order of the Special Term.
The question presented at Special Term and on this appeal, relates solely to the constitutionality of the act under which the appellant was arrested. Laws of 1884, p. 335, c. 272. The act is as follows :
â€?An act to improve the public health by prohibiting the manufacture of cigars and preparation of tobacco in any form in tenement houses in certain cases, and regulating the use of tenement houses in certain cases, passed Hay 12, 1884.
â€?The people of the state of New York, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows: â–?â€?Section 1. The manufacture of cigars or preparation of tobacco in any form on any floor, or in any part of any floor, in any tenement house, is hereby prohibited, if such floor, or any part of such floor, is, by any person, occupied as a home or residence for the purpose of living, sleeping, cooking, or doing any household work therein.
â€œSection 2. Any house, building or portion thereof occupied as the home or residence of more than three families, living independently of one another, and doing their cooking upon the premises, is a tenement house within the meaning of this act.
â€?Section 3. The first floor of said tenement house on which there is a store for the sale of cigars and tobacco, shall be exempt from the prohibition provided in section one of this act.
â€?Section 4. It shall be the duty of every sanitary inspector of any city to which this act is applicable, to report any violation of this act coming to his knowledge forthwith, to a police magistrate, and to procure the punishment of the person or persons having committed such violation; but this provision shall not be construed to preclude any other citizen from performing the duty herein assigned to said sanitary inspector.
â€?Section 5. Every person who shall be found guilty of a violation of this act, or of having caused another to commit such violation, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished for every offense by a fine of not less than ten and not more than one hundred dollars, or by imprisonment for not less than ten days and not more than six months, or both such fine and imprisonment.
â€?Section 6. This act shall apply only to cities having over five hundred thousand inhabitants.
â€?Section 7. All acts or parts of acts inconsistent with this act, are hereby repealed.
â€?Section 8. This act shall take effect immediately.â€?This Act, it will be observed, is a local one having no general operation throughout the state. It is in force by its terms only in cities â€?having over five hundred thousand inhabitants,â€?and, as the courts can take judicial notice of the population in cities, it must be held to be applicable only to the cities of New York and Brooklyn. Its title, although it does not declare this fact, is probably definite enough to save it from the condemnation which the Court of Appeals imposed on the similar Act of 1883 (Laws of 1883, c. 93). Matter of Paul, 2 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 1; 94 N. Y. 497. By its second section the act declares the kind of â€?tenement house â€?to which alone it is applicable, to wit: â€?any house, building, or portion thereof occupied as the house or residence of more than three families living independently of one another, and doing their cooking upon the premises.â€?In such a tenement house the act prohibits the manufacture of cigars or preparation of tobacco in any form, not generally, but on any floor or in any part of any floor, if such floor or any part of such floor is by any person occupied as a home or residence for the purpose of living, sleeping, cooking, or doing any household work therein; and to this the third section adds the exception that if on the first floor of such tenement house there is a store for the sale of cigars and tobacco that floor shall be exempt from the operation of the act.
It seems entirely clear that this act, if valid, operates to deprive the owner or occupant of any floor in such a tenement house as it describes, with the exception mentioned, of the right to carry on his lawful occupation, by which he supports himself and family, in any part of his own residence. That right is in a general sense his own absolute property, and he is protected in its enjoyment by the Constitution of the state. â€?The property,â€?says Smith, in his â€?Wealth of Nations,â€?â€?which every man has in his own labor, as it is the original foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable. The patrimony of the poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his own hands, and to hinder him from employing the strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper without injury to his neighbor, is a plain violation of this most sacred property. It is a manifest encroachment against the just liberty both of the workman and those who might be disposed to employ him. As it hinders the one from working at what he thinks proper, so it hinders the other from employing whom he thinks proper.â€?In Bertholf v. O'Reilly (74 N. Y. 515) it was said: â€?The right to life includes the right of the individual to his body in its completeness and without dismemberment; the right to liberty, the right to exercise his faculties and to follow a lawful avocation for the support of life, the- right of property, the right to acquire, possess and enjoy it in any way consistent with the equal rights of others and the just exactions and demands of the state.â€?In Live Stock Association v. Crescent City Co. (1 Abb. U. S. 388) it is said: 1C It is one of the privileges of every American citizen to adopt and follow such lawful industrial pursuit, not in jurious to the community, as he may see fit without unreasonable regulation or molestation. . . . There is no more sacred right of citizenship than the right to pursue unmolested a lawful employment â–?in a lawful manner. It is nothing more than the sacred right of labor.â€?In the celebrated Slaughter House case (16 Wall. 36) Bradley, J., in his dissenting opinion, says : â€?The right to choose one's calling is an essential part of that liberty which it is the object of government to protect, and a calling, when chosen, is a manâ€™s property and right. Liberty and property are not protected when their rights are arbitrarily assailed. ... In my. view, a law which prohibits a large class of citizens from adopting a lawful. employment, or from following a lawful employment previously adopted, does deprive them of liberty as well as property without due process of law. Their right of choice is their liberty, their occupation is their property.â€?A French edict declares that â€?God, in giving to man wants and desires rendering labor necessary to their satisfaction, conferred the right to labor on all men, and this is property the first, most sacred, and imprescriptable of all.â€?Edict of Louis XVI., 1776.
And Chancellor Kent (2 Kentâ€™s Comm. 1) defines the absolute rights of individuals as â€?the right of personal security, the right of personal liberty, and the right to acquire and enjoy property. These rights,â€?he says, â€?have been justly considered and frequently declared by the people of this country to be natural, inherent, and inalienable.â€?Without citing further authorities, it may be stated as a legal and political axiom that since the great laboring masses of our country have little or no property but their labor, and the free right to employ it to their own best interests and advantage, it must be considered that the constitutional inhibition against all invasions of property without due process of law was as fully intended to embrace and protect that property as any of the accumulations it may have gained. It is not constitutionally competent, therefore, for the legislature to deprive by any arbitrary enactment a laborer in any lawful vocation of his right to work and enjoy the fruits of his work in his own residence and in his own way, except for the purposes of police or health regulations as hereinafter considered. It is equally true also that when an artizan or laborer has rented a tenement for the residence of his family, with the right to cany on his trade or occupation therein, he has thereby acquired certain rights of property in the use and enjoyment of his tenement, of which he cannot be deprived without due .process of law. An arbitrary law for the mere purposes of such deprivation is absolutely dead at its birth by force of the Constitution of the state.
These general principles are hardly disputed on the part of the respondents ; but it is insisted quite correctly that they are subject to an exception or limitation which permits the enactment of laws which may regulate or limit or restrain the en joyment and use of such absolute rights and property, by police regulations to preserve the public peace, safety or health, and â– that the Legislature is the sole judge of what laws are necessary or requisite to those ends.
Without pointing out what exceptions, conditions and refinements are applicable to these propositions, it is enough to says in the words of the respondentâ€™s counsel that â€œIt is the undoubted .province of the court to decide whether or not any particular act was or was not upon its face passed by the Legislature in the exercise of the police power, .and .as a health regulation.â€?In this case the appellant while in the exercise of a perfectly lawful right to use and enjoy the property of his own labor by conducting a manufacture inÂ»the line of his avocation, quietly and peaceably in his own hired house, suddenly finds his business declared a crime and himself absolutely prohibited from carrying it on in his own house under severe criminal penalties by an act of the Legislature which takes effect immediately, and he presently is arrested and held in custody for using his accustomed mode of earning the bread of himself and family. When he impugns the act under which this is done, he has a right to demand that the courts shall inquire whether the act is a valid exercise of the power to enact police regulations to preserve public health or safety. And this means more than that the act professes to be of that kind. It means that it must be so in reality and not something else in the guise of such a purpose.
A careful study of the act has satisfied us that its aim was not â€?to improve the public health by prohibiting the manufacture of cigars and preparation of tobacco in any form in tenement houses in certain cases, and regulating the use of tenement houses in certain cases â€?as declared in the title; but to suppress, and restain such manufacture in the cases covered by the act, for the purpose of preventing successful competition injurious to other mode of manufacturing the same articles. We think we find abundant evidence of this object on the face of the act. First it selects for its field of operation from the general and numerous tenement houses of the city, a limited class, to wit, such as are â€?occupied as the home or residence of more than three families living independently of one another, and doing their cooking upon the premises.â€?The result of this selection is, that all tenement houses having more than three, or more than twenty families, living in common or not doing their cooking on the premises are not within the act. Certainly, if health were the object, all such tenements would be embraced for they are especially within the professed mischief. It is the thronged and overcrowded tenements, which swarm from cellar to attic with tenants who live, not independently, but in promiscuous dependence, without cooking in their tenements but from hand to mouth in the streets and grog-shops, or as beggars at houses for food, whose health most needs the protection of police regulations; but they are not included within the act.
Again, by the 3rd section, the first floor of the designated tenement is exempt from the operation of the law if in addition to the manufacture, there be a store for selling cigars and tobacco on that floor. That fact, if health were the object, should be a reason for more stringent restriction instead of exception, because it would cause that floor to be the resort of more persons whose health might be exposed; but one nuisance to health is in the theory of the act, cured by another. It is of no consequence that on the same floor there may be a half dozen families, each carrying on the manufacture of cigars or tobacco in their living rooms, where they eat, sleep and cook. They are not subject to the law while the head of a family on the next or any other floor of the same tenement, is a criminal for carrying on his occupation of manufacturing cigars in any room of such floor.
Surely this sort of discrimination must be based upon some other idea than the health of tenants, or of the public. It is too vicious to be just or lawful. But in the prohibited tenement, the manufacture is made criminal only â€?on any floor or part of any floor occupied by any person as a home or residence for the purpose of living, sleeping, cooking or doing any household work therein.â€?This section has no regard to the size of the floor. There may be ten or twenty rooms (and in some of the tenement houses there are numerous rooms on each floor), isolated so as to have no communication with each other, yet the bare fact that some person eats or sleeps or lives in one of the most distant rooms of the floor, without communication or connection with that used for the business, makes it a crime to manufacture cigars in any other room on that floor. Again, under this act every one of the seven rooms occupied by the appellant and his family may be used for the purpose of manufacturing cigars and tobacco by himself or other tenants occupying the several floors above for the purpose of living, sleeping, cooking and doing household work, and the case will not be within the statute. If the aim be to protect health why is not such case brought within the prohibition ? But it may be argued that the intention was to make the manufacture criminal only because of danger to the health of persons who live or sleep or cook or do some sort of household work, on the same floor.
Why then, it may be repeated, is the exception made which allows the health of such persons to be exposed, if only there be the addition on the same floor of a store to sell cigars and tobacco % Health is absolutely lost sight of in such a case, and no sensible reason can be perceived for such an exception unless indeed some promoter of the law happens to be in that condition as a maker and vender, and needed the exception to protect him.
But again, if the health of occupants of the same floor were alone in view, why is the act applied only to tenements occupied as the home or residence of more than three families ? If the occupants are limited to three families or less, any or every one of them may make cigars or manufacture tobacco in any or every room on his floor, and the act does not condemn it. It is not easy to see, if the object be to protect the health of persons living on the floor of the manufacture, why such health docs not require as much protection in the case of three tenants in the same building as of four.
Under the act, if there be but three families a living independent of one another, and doing their cooking on the premises,â€?either may manufacture cigars or tobacco in a floor and in the living rooms of any number of people without limit; but if there be four families in the tenement no one can manufacture cigars on any floor which is by any one person occupied for doing any household work whatever.
It is impossible, we think, to hold that this act is a police enactment to preserve public health, because it clearly fails to accomplish that purpose to any reasonable extent.
It does, on the contrary, quite another thing. It strikes with unjust and cruel severity a class of humble manufacturers, too poor to live elsewhere than in crowded tenement houses, unable to have a store on their premises, or to rent a shop outside of their residences in which to do their work, but constrained by the necessities of their families or themselves to use a part of their rooms to carry on their daily occupation. They are singled out with keen discrimination, and their industry is made a crime, unless they submit to abandon it or find employment outside of their homes. If the act were general, and aimed at all tenement houses, and prohibited, for sanitary reasons, the manufacture of cigars and tobacco in all such buildings, or if it prohibited such manufacture in the living rooms of all tenants, another case would be presented. But in the form in which it comes before us, it is unjust in its inequality, so harsh and oppressive upon the labor of poverty, so keenly discriminative in favor of the stronger classes engaged in the same occupation, that it certainly ought not to have been enacted; but being enacted, ought to be held invalid, because it deprives the appellant of his right and liberty to use his occupation in his own house for the support of himself and family, and takes away the value of his labor, which is his property, protected by the Constitution equally as though it were in lands or money, without due process of law.
We are therefore of opinion that the act in question should be adjudged to be unconstitutional, and that the order of the court below should be reversed, and an order entered discharging the appellant from imprisonment.
Daniels, J.
I agree entirely in the views expressed in this opinion, and add as a further.reason supporting the conclusion that the act Avas not, in fact, intended for the promotion of the public health, the omission tp include tenement houses in the other cities of the state within its prohibitions. If it was necessary for New York and Brooklyn, it was for the other cities. For tobacco is prepared and cigars made in tenement houses and residences in most or all of such cities. But they have not been included, and their exclusion is strong evidence that other reasons than the protection of health induced the passage of the act. If it were necessary for one city, it was for all. But by its enactment, what is a perfectly lawful occupation in all other cities, is made a criminal offense under precisely similar circumstances in New York and Brooklyn. It deprived persons from there doing what it left them at full liberty to do elsewhere. The discrimination was conspicuously unjust, and not warranted by the fundamental law of the state.

1167710,PEOPLE v. MULLER,1884-10,"Andrews, J.
The first count in the indictment charges the defendant with selling an indecent and obscene photograph, repreenting a nude female in a lewd, obscene, indecent, scandalous, and lascivious attitude and posture, and the second count charges him with having in his possession divers lewd, scandalous, obscene and indecent photographs of the same ""character, with intent to sell the same. Section 317 of the Penal Code declares among other things, that a person who sells, lends, gives away, or offers to' give away, or shows, or has in his possession with intent to sell, or give away, or to show, or advertise, or otherwise offers for loan, gift, sale or distribution, an obscene or indecent book, writing, paper, fixture, drawing or photograph is guilty of a misdemeanor. The evidence on the trial in support of the indictment related to nine photographs produced before the jury, which were proved to have been sold by the defendant in the ordinary course of his employment as a clerk in a store for the sale of books, pictures, and photographs, in the city of New York.
The record contains no special description of the photographs, except that it appears that they represented nude females, and were photographic copies of paintings which had been exhibited in the Salon in Paris, and one of them at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, and among them were pictures designated â€?Lâ€™Asphyxie,â€?â€?After the Bath,â€?and 6Cla Baigneuse.â€?The jury, by their verdict of guilty, necessarily found that the photographs were obscene and indecent. The exhibits were produced on the argument of the appeal at the General Term, and the court in its opinion expressed its concurrence with the finding of the jury, saying that they might very well have' found that the photographs were both indecent and obscene. They were not produced in this court, and we are unable to pass upon the question of their obscenity or indecency from the pictures themselves. If the defendantâ€™s counsel desired to insist in this court, that the photographs were not in fact indecent or obscene, and that this appeared from the photographs themselves, and that the finding of the jury was therefore without evidence to support it, it was his duty to have furnished them as a part of the record, or to have insisted upon their production by the district attorney.
Upon the case as presented, we must assume that the pictures were of the character described in the indictment. But exceptions were taken by the defendant on the trial which render it necessary to consider to some extent the scope of the statute, the method of trying the issue of obscenity and indecency, and the relevancy of proof of an innocent intent on the part of a defendant charged with a violation of the statute.
It is to be observed that the statute does not undertake to define obscene or indecent pictures or publications. But the words used in the statute are themselves descriptive. They are words in common use, and every person of ordinary intelligence understands their meaning, and readily, and in most cases accurately applies them to any object or thing brought to his atttention which involves a judgment as to the quality indicated. It does not require an expert in art or literature to determine whether a picture is obscene or indecent, or whether printed words are offensive to decency and good morals. These are matters which fall within the range of ordinary intelligence, and a jury does not require to be informed by an expert before pronouncing upon them. It is evident that mere nudity in painting or sculpture is not obscenity. Some of the great works in painting and sculpture, as all know, represent nude human forms. It is a false delicacy and mere prudery which would condemn and banish from sight all such objects as obscene, simply on"" account of their nudity. If the test of obscenity or indecency in a picture or statue is its capability of suggesting impure thoughts, then indeed all such representations might be considered as indecent or obscene. The presence of a woman of the purest character and of the most modest behavior or bearing, may suggest to a prurient imagination images of lust, and arouse impure desires, and so it is of any picture or statue.
The test of an obscene book was stated in Regina v. Hicklin (L. R. 3 Q. B. 369) to be, whether the tendency of the matter to be charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and who might come in contact with it. We think it would also be a proper test of obscenity in a painting or statue, whether the motive of the painting or statue, so to speak, as indicated by it, is pure.or impure, whether it is naturally calculated to excite in a spectator impure imaginations, and whether the other incidents and qualities, however attractive, were merely accessary to this as the primary or main purpose of the representation.
The defendant, on the trial, called as witnesses an artist who had practiced painting for many years, and also a person who had been, engaged in the study of art. They were asked by defendantâ€™s counsel whether there was a distinguishing line, as understood by artists, between pure art and obscene and indecent art. The question was objected to by the prosecutor, and excluded by the court. The issue to be tried was whether the particular photographs in question were obscene or indecent. The defendant was entitled to prove in his defense any facts legitimately bearing upon this issue. The fact that the original pictures of which the photographs were copies had been exhibited in the Salon in Paris was admitted by the prosecution, and it was proved that one of them had been publicly exhibited in Philadelphia. But this did not, as a matter of law, exclude a finding by the jury that the photographs were obscene and indecent. It is not impossible certainly that the public exhibition of indecent pictures may have been permitted in Paris or Philadelphia, and the fact that a picture had been publicly exhibited would not necessarily determine its character as decent or indecent. Indeed, there is but little scope for proof bearing upon the issue of decency or obscenity beyond the evidence furnished by the picture itself.
The question which was excluded, if intended to bring out the fact that pictures might be either decent or indecent, and that the canons of pure art would accept those of one class and reject those of the other was properly rejected, as an attempt to prove a self-evident proposition. If the question was intended to be followed by proof that, according to the standard of judgment adopted and recognized by artists, the photographs in question were not obscene or indecent, it was properly rejected for the reason that the issue was not, whether, in the opinion of witnesses or of a class of people, the photographs were indecent or obscene, but whether they were so in fact, and upon this issue witnesses could neither be permitted to give their own opinions or to state the aggregate opinion of a particular class or part of the community. To permit such evidence would put the witness in the place of the jury and the latter would have no function to discharge. The testimony of experts is not admissible upon matters of judgment within the knowledge and experience of ordinary jurymen. 1 Greenl. Ev. 440. The question whether a picture or writing is obscene, is one of the plainest that can be presented to a jury, and under the guidance of a discreet judge there is little danger of their reaching a wrong conclusion. The opinions of witnesses would not aid the jury in reaching a conclusion, and their admission would contravene the general rule that facts and not Opinions are to be given in evidence.
The defendantâ€™s counsel, at the conclusion of the evidence, made several requests to charge, which were denied by the trial judge. The leading purpose of those requests was to induce the court to lay down the rule that the intent of a defendant in selling a picture claimed to be indecent and obscene is an important element in determining his guilt. The statute makes the selling of an obscene and indecent picture a misdemeanor. There is no exception by reason of any special intent in making the sale. The object of the statute was to suppress the traffic in obscene publications, and to protect the community against the contamination and pollution arising from their exhibition and distribution. It would, we conceive, be no answer to an indictment under the statute for the sale of an obscene picture, that it was sold to a person not liable to be injured by it, or that it was a picture, in respect to execution, of distinguished merit.
In Regina v. Hicklin (supra) the question arose whether a certain book was obscene, and liable to seizure for that reason under an English statute.. It appeared that it"" was published to expose the alleged immoralities of private confession in the Roman Catholic church. But the court having found that passages purporting to be extracts from the writings of Roman Catholics were obscene in fact, it was held that the intent of the publication, however innocent, was no answer to the proceeding.
We do not doubt that whetner a publication is obscene or not may in some cases depend on circumstances. For example, a medical book for the instruction of medical men may contain illustrations suitable and proper as a part of the work, but which, if detached and published alone for circulation, might be deemed indecent under the statute. In the present case there was no evidence to which the requests to charge were applicable. The pictures in question were kept for general sale, except that they were not sold to boys under twenty-one years of age. The requests as applied to the case were a series of abstract propositions, having no relation to the issue, and were on that ground, independently of any other consideration, properly denied. We find no error in the record. The case seems to have been fairly tried, and was submitted to the jury in a careful charge, and with the verdict of the jury this court cannot interfere. The statute is an important one, and while it should have a reasonable and not a strained construction, at the same time it ought to have such a practical interpretation by the court and jury as will subserve the important purpose of the enactment.
The judgment should be affirmed.
All concur.
Note. â€”A pamphlet on the treatment of spermatorrhoea and impotency made up largely of extracts from standard medical works, but of an obscene and indecent character intended to be circulated generally, comes within the provisions of the U. S. statute (U. S. Rev. Stat. Â§ 3893) against the mailing of obscene or indecent publications. United States v. Chesman, 19 Fed. Rep. 497 (Circuit Ct. E. D. Missouri, 30th March, 1881).
In the most recent case on this subject, a prosecution for giv ing away an indecent pictorial newspaper, tending to debauch the public morals, with intent to circulate the same, the defendant sought to introduce in evidence other publications of a similar character. On appeal the court held that such evidence was inadmissible and wrote as follows: â€œWe are of opinion that the court did right in prohibiting him from reading and exhibiting to them, pictures publicly displayed which he claimed to be of a more indecent character and having a more direct tendency to debauch public morals than anything that appeared in the paper prosecuted. As well might the keeper of a lewd or disorderly house or the proprietor of a gaming-house or table claim, that he has not violated the law when called upon upon to answer for his offense, because others indulged in these nefarious practices openly and with impunity and were not prosecuted for their criminal offences. ...... To have suffered this defendant to have roamed through the wide field of vulgar erotic literature and obscene pictorial illustration and parade before the court and country nude pictures designed to excite passion, and lascivious and wanton articles taken from the daily press, would not only have been an abuse of the law under which this right is claimed, but would have been pandering to, and encouraging the very evil which the statute then being enforced was designed to suppress. No respectable magistrate could for a moment tolerate a spectacle so gross and outrageous.â€?Montross v.

1167683,PEOPLE v. STOKES,1882-06,"Merwin, J.
On the part of the defendant it is claimed among other things that the verdict is clearly against the evidence, and that, therefore, under the provisions of sub. 6, section 465 of Code of Criminal Procedure a new trial should he granted.
Upon this proposition it is suggested that there is no evidence that the defendant knew that the mixture which apparently operated to produce the death was poisonous. In Wharton's Criminal Evidence, 8th ed., section 794, it is laid down that in order to convict of murder there must be a knowledge of the dangerous character of the poison. Very evidently this is necessary in order to show an intent to kill. In the present case there is no evidence that defendant knew that the mixture was poisonous. He did not buy it himself; he is not shown to have known of what ingredients it was composed. A recipe was referred to on the trial, but it was not in evidence or shown to be in defendantâ€™s possession. The mixture was prepared by Crouch and used by him for an honest purpose, and for the same purpose which he stated to the druggist. It was used in December previous to the death, and what was then done with it or who had it, does not appear, except that it was found the day after the death in the room in which the post-mortem had been held. Assuming that defendant knew that in the mixture there were mercury and nitric acid, it is not shown that he knew the dangerous character of these elements or of the compound. It is said he was a tinsmith, and therefore must have known it. That sequence does not follow. It is not shown that as a tinsmith he dealt in those articles or had any occasion to use mem. This cannot be inferred. He was present when Crouch made up the compound. The packages which Crouch had received of the druggist were not marked by the druggist as poisonous. The particular manifestations at the time they were mixed would indicate that the articles were not entirely harmless. They would also indicate that a change then took place; and whether the compound was dangerous or not, a person unskilled or unacquainted would not be expected to know. A knowledge that the compound might not be entirely harmless might be reasonably inferred, but the character or extent of the harm would be entirely a matter of speculation.
In cases of this kind the purchase or possession of poison under false pretenses and a knowledge of its properties are deemed among the most, if not the most material circumstances. 1 Arch. Cr. Pr. & Pl., 8th ed. 856; 3 Whar. Cr. Law, 7th ed., section 3494, a. Their absence in this case is a matter to be seriously considered.
As bearing upon the knowledge of the defendant of the character of the mixture as well as upon his connection with the act itself, it is said that defendant stated differently about his knowledge of the mixture at the time of its discovery and at the time he testified before the coroner a few days after its discovery. At the time of its discovery he said he did not know what was in the bottle or where it. came from or anything about it. Before the coroner he testified that he didnâ€™t know what was in the bottle; that it came from Campâ€™s; that Crouch get it for silver washing. The variance will be noticed. If it be true that nothing had been done about this mixture by the defendant, after the experiments of Crouch in December, then it would not be strange for the defendant to fail to identify it at the time when first suddenly called on about it, and then afterwards before testifying have ascertained or recalled to memory the fact that it was got by Crouch at Campâ€™s for silver washing. In other words the variance may be accounted for consistently with defendantâ€™s innocence; whether it can be done so reasonably, depends largely upon what other circumstances there may be in the case that are of doubtful construction and which may raise grounds for suspicion. A single circumstance involving a slight suspicion may be worthless and deserve no consideration while several of that kind, based on distinct evidence, may lead the mind far toward the presumption of guilt.
We come then to the consideration of other circumstancer which are claimed to be suspicious. It is said that when he was informed of the sickness -of -his wife he delayed to give he attention and delayed sending for the doctor; that he was too ready in his explanations to the -doctor; that he knew her fatal condition before he saw the doctor, as indicated by his remark to his son in the presence of Â¡Clifton; that he saw Bobbins about noon, too ostentatiously; that after the death he was too ready for investigation. As to these matters I have carefully considered the evidence, and I find nothing which cannot be explained consistently with innocence. She had previously been troubled with indigestion and had -bad spells sometimes, and was generally costive. She was on the morning in question as well as usual, and insisted upon going to work. The information given the defendant by Mrs. Hovey as to her being sick might fairly be attributed to one of her usual spells, and would not require him to drop every thing in order to see to her. How long the delay was does not appear. It was not long. He then gave her the usual remedies, so far as it appears; they not giving relief he went for the doctor. His manner then was natural for an innocent man. When the doctor came he asked the deceased what she had been taking. This might refer either to what she had taken to relieve her sickness, or to what she had taken that produced it. The doctor did not ask her what brought on or caused her sickness. She replied to the doctorâ€™s question that she had taken nothing but what they had given her.' The defendant then stated what he had given her; no part of his statement was contradicted by otherâ€™s evidence. Rex v. Jones, 2 C. & P. 629. He was certainly called on to state what he had given. Had he refused or stated untruly or hesitated, it would have been much more suspicious. The time of day in which he spoke to the boy in presence of Clifton is concededly so uncertain upon the evidence, that no particular weight is to be given to it. So the occurrence testified to by Eobbins looks to me as quite insignificant, as well as uncertain in time, with reference to the time that the wife was sick. The distance from the defendantâ€™s store to where Bobbinâ€™s was, was short. The act of defendant was brief, and it might readily have happened before the sickness of the deceased' assumed apparently a dangerous form. The readiness of defendant to have an investigation looks to me far from having a guilty tendency. In weighing these circumstances the question is not whether they are consistent with his guilt. If there were other circumstances which authorized the presumption of his guilt, then the question would be whether there was anything else in the case that was inconsistent with his guilt, but when we weigh the circumstances themselves from which the guilt is sought to be inferred, we must assume and start with the presumption of innocence. If all the circumstances shown are consistent with innocence, then there can be no conviction. If they are not, then the question is whether they point to guilt so clearly and distinctly as to satisfy the mind beyond a reasonable doubt. The facts proved must all be consistent with and point to the defendantâ€™s guilt not only, but they must be inconsistent with his innocence. Per Church, C. J., in People v. Bennett, 49 N. Y. 144. If equally susceptible of two interpretations, one innocent and one not, the innocent one must be taken. Pollock v. Pollock, 71 N. Y. 137; Schultz v. Hoagland, 85 N. Y. 464. So it is said that if it be shown that either the defendant or a third person committed the deed, but it cannot be distinctly ascertained which one,- the defendant cannot be convicted. 1 Bishop's Cr. Pro. (3d Ed.), Â§ 1106. The same author, section 1079, lavs it down as established by many adjudications that the test of the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence is that the facts proved can be reasonably accounted for on no hypothesis which excluded the defendantâ€™s guilt; that with the theory of his guilt they are harmonious and consistent, and that they point to it so clearly and distinctly as to satisfy the jury of it beyond a reasonable -doubt.
The trouble in this case is, to be able to say that the facts proved are inconsistent with defendantâ€™s innocence; that they cannot be accounted for reasonably on any hypothesis which excludes the defendantâ€™s guilt. The question in my mind is whether upon the evidence here, there are not two hypotheses which at least are as reasonable as that of defendantâ€™s guilt.
I have thus far not referred to the evidence on the subject of motive. There is much in the case on that subject. Motive, however' strong, does not prove the crime. Its office is to aid in the application of other circumstances that point toward guilt. It is said to be a minor or an auxiliary fact from which, when established in connection with other necessary facts, the main or primary fact of guilt may be inferred. Pierson v. People, 18 Hun, 253. When the case depends upon circumstantial evidence, and the circumstances point to any particular person as the criminal, the case against him is much fortified by proof that he had a motive to commit the crime ; and where the motive appears, the probabilities created by the other evidence are much strengthened. Earl, J., in Pierson v. People, 79 N. Y. 436.
In the present case the evidence discloses a very unpleasant state of things in the family of the defendant. I have no doubt the situation in this regard has had a tendency to his prejudice. Quarrels between husband and wife are said to be entitled to but little weight unless connected in some way with the fatal wound. Whar. Cr. Ev. Â§ 786. That probably, however, depends upon the intensity and permanency of the feeling engendered in such quarrels. The evidence here does not show any permanent feeling in the defendant against his wife herself, nor any feeling at all against her upon the day in question. The question for the court to determine on this motion is whether the evidence pointing to the guilt of the defendant was sufficiently strong to authorize the jury to say that he was guilty. Does the evidence authorize that finding ? If it does, then the verdict must stand, although the court might have come to a different conclusion. If it does not, then the verdict would be clearly against evidence, and should be set aside. In the case of People v. Bennett, 49 N. Y. 137, cited by the counsel for the people, the ill-treatment by the defendant of his wife was connected with the occurrence of the fatal wound. There was evidence that she could not have inflicted it herself. He knew of her bleeding profusely, but did nothing to help her. In that case the court were divided on the question whether the verdict was against evidence, but it was set aside on another ground.
Having in view the proposition laid down in the Bennett case, that the facts proved must all be consistent with and point to his guilt not only, but they must be inconsistent with his innocence, or, as it is put in Poole v. People, 80 N. Y. 645, be inexplicable upon the theory of innocence; and having in view the want of connection shown between the defendant and the poison producing the death, I am of the opinion.that the verdict is not authorized by the evidence.
Motion granted.

Wells, 61 Iowa, 629; 47 Am. Rep. 822), it is murder in the first degree.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1167673,PEOPLE v. GRIMSHAW,1884-09,"Daniels, J.
The indictment charged the defendant with having feloniously, willfully, and knowingly sworn falsely by giving material evidence in an action brought by Fannie A. Devine against Thomas A. Devine for a limited divorce. The action was referred to a referee, who duly qualified as such, and administered an oath to this defendant as a witness upon the trial. Â¡No further statement of the issues in the action was contained in the indictment, and it was objected to as being insufficient in this respect, and Gaston v. People, 61 Barb. 35, has been relied upon as sustaining this objection. But as the indictment in that case was in another respect materially defective, the decision may very well have secured the concurrence of the members of the court for a reversal, because of that defect, without any stress being placed upon the absence of the statement of the issue in the civil action. This case is also distinguishable from that by the fact that the nature and description of the action was sufficiently given to enable the defendant to understand the charge intended to be made against him. That conformed to the preceding rule required to be observed before the enactment of the Code of Criminal Procedure. For by that rule it was â€œsufficient to charge generally that the false oath was material on the trial of the issue upon which it was taken. It is not necessary to show particularly how it was material, and this is the case though the record does not itself show that the false oath was material.â€?Wharton Crim. Law, 4th Ed. Â§ 2263. And the substance of this rule has been embodied in the Code of Criminal Procedure prescribing the form and.contents of an indictment. For to comply with the law all that is required is that the indictment shall contain â€?the name of the crime, if it have one, such as treason, murder, arson, manslaughter and the like, or if it be a misdemeanor having no general name, such as libel, assault or the like, insert a brief description of it, as it is given by the statute.â€?Code Crim. Proc. Â§ 276.
This indictment conformed to both of these requirements, for it not only stated the nature of the action in which the defendant was sworn, but, in addition thereto, that the inquiry made of him was a material one, and by falsely and knowingly giving his evidence he â€?did commit willful and corrupt perjury.â€?These allegations brought the case clearly within the Code of Criminal Procedure and also within section 96 of the Penal Code, by which the crime of perjury has been defined and declared.
It was charged in the indictment that the defendant committed perjury by knowingly and falsely giving the following evidence upon the trial of the issue before the referee: â€?I (himself the said George Grimshaw thereby meaning) saw her (the said Fannie A. Devine thereby meaning) in Twelfth Street, Williamsburg (the said Williamsburg in the City of Brooklyn thereby meaning), on the ninth day of July, 1879, walking with a man side by side, and I (himself the said George Grimshaw thereby meaning) saw her (the said Fannie A. D'evinÃ© thereby meaning) go into a house with him in Twelfth Street, between South Third and South Fourth Streets ; I (himself the said Grimshaw thereby meaning) knew the reputation of the house; it (the said house thereby meaning) was a bed-house,' properly speaking; I (himself the said George Grimshaw thereby meaning) mean a house where men can take women for sexual intercourse; I (himself the said George Grimshaw thereby meaning) should judge they (the said Fannie A. Devine and the said man thereby meaning) remained there about an hour.â€?And the proof given upon the trial established the fact that he did give that evidence before the referee. This, however, was objected to as insufficient to create the crime of perjury, for the reason that the man who was stated to have accompanied the plaintiff in the action, was not alleged, not to have been the plaintiffâ€™s husband. But this allegation was not essential for the purpose of setting forth that the crime of perjury had been committed. The pleadings in the action tried before the referee were produced and given in evidence upon the trial of the defendant, and one of the defenses contained in the answer of the defendant, in whose behalf the present defendant was sworn as a witness was the following: â€?3. That the defendant is informed and believes that the plaintiff has been guilty of gross and- immoral conduct; and that, on or about the ninth day of July, 1879, committed adultery with a man, whose name is unknown to defendant, at a house in Twelfth Street, in the City of Brooklyn, E. D.â€?And this was a defense which the law allowed to be made to an action for a separation or limited divorce. For by section 1765 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the defendant in such an action has been permitted to set up by way of justification the misconduct of the plaintiff, and if such misconduct is established it entitled the defendant to judgment in his favor. And this branch of the answer set forth the commission of misconduct on the part of the wife, which, if it had been proven, would have justified her husband in abandoning her, as he is alleged to have done on or about the 18th of October 1880, when he discovered her guilt in that respect. And it was to establish that part of the issue in the action that this evidence was given. It was proven upon the trial that the defendant did given the testimony set forth as having been given by him in the indictment. And that tended to establish a material fact in the way of supporting and sustaining this defense. It was not necessary to render it material that it should also include the fact that the man stated to have been with the plaintiff in the action was not her husband. That was an important fact to complete the proof of the defense set forth in the answer, and without it, the defense itself could not have been made out. But it was still a material inquiry upon the trial whether the plaintiff did go into the house referred to in the indictment in company with a man. That was an important fact included within the limits of the defense set forth. If she did, then the case would clearly be ready for the further proof that the man accompanying her was not her husband, and both together would tend very decidedly to establish the defense. For this purpose each of the alleged facts was probably of equal importance. It was necessary that it should be shown that the plaintiff went into the house with a man, and also that the man with her was not her husband. Each included a material inquiry in the case, and evidence given to prove either of these facts would consequently be material to the issue. And as the defendant is shown to have given evidence directly tending to establish the existence of one of these facts, if that was wilfully false, he committed the crime of perjury in giving it, for it has been held, that â€?if a person swears falsely in respect to any fact relevant to the issue being tried, then we think he is guilty of perjury, although the case failed from defect of proof of another fact, and although the other fact alleged had no existence.â€?â€?The evidence would be relevant to the cause and it does not lie with the perjurer to say that if he had sworn to the truth, the case for other reasons would have failed.â€?Wood v. People, 59 N. Y. 117, 123.
The evidence given by the defendant related to an important fact directly within the issue and which was made to appear by the indictment to have been material upon the trial of the action in which the defendant gave his testimony.
Upon the trial of the indictment two witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution who were familiar with the locality in which the house was situated, where it was stated by the evidence of the defendant, the plaintiff in the action against her husband was seen by him to have entered. These witnesses gave evidence very directly tending to establish the fact that no house of the character mentioned by the defendant in his evidence existed, or was to be found, in that locality. And that was probably as far as the prosecution could be expected to give evidence negativing the existence of a house of bad character, or bad repute, in the neighborhood. The evidence of the plaintiff herself upon the trial of the indictment, was direct and positive that she went into no house of the character of that stated by the defendant. That fully met the evidence given by him upon the trial of her action, and the further proof was produced to sustain the indictment that there was no such house as the defendant had stated she went into with the man, within the bounds mentioned by him in his testimony. And that seems to have been all that could reasonably be required to put him upon his defense. For what the law has exacted is not positive proof of the falsity of the evidence in addition to that given by the prosecuting witness, but that there should be additional evidence strongly corroborative of' that given by the accusing witness. 1 Greenleaf Evidence, 7th Ed. Â§ 257; 3 lb. Â§ 198 ; United States v. Wood, 14 Peters, 430, where the testimony of one witness corroborated by circumstances proved by other evidence was declared to be sufficient. This point was also considered in Woodbeck v. Keller, 6 Cowen, 118. That was an action of slander in which the defendant justified the speaking of the slanderous words, and it was held that it required the same measure of proof to sustain the defense as would be necessary to sustain an indictment for perjury, and that such measure would be supplied if the additional evidence was strongly corroborative of the testimony of the complaining witness.
The evidence given upon this trial was of that description, for it tended very directly to establish the fact that there was no house of assignation within the limits mentioned by the defendant in his evidence at the time referred to by him, or near that time, and if there was none then it is entirely certain that she could have gone into no such house as he described This evidence was sufficient to place him under the obligation of proving that there was such a house at that time in the locality, if it actually existed. If there was, it was a fact within his knowledge, and that of persons who were accessible to him, and his failure to produce any witness upon the trial to establish the truth of this part of his statement, tended materially to strengthen and confirm the evidence given by the witnesses sworn on the part of the prosecution. People v. Dyle, 21 N. Y. 578 ; Gordon v. People, 33 Id. 501; Bleeker v. Johnston, 69 Id. 309.
In the submission of the case to the jury, the court charged that as Mrs. Devine had been a witness on the trial of her action against her husband, that the evidence of the defendant was material in so far as it affected her credibility, and to that charge the defendantâ€™s counsel excepted. It is not necessary to consider this exception with any considerable degree of detail, for if the court was wrong in the direction so given, the error could not have prejudiced the defendant. For as the evidence was material to the issue in the action, that was all that could be required to sustain this part of the peojfieâ€™s case. And that it was so material has already been shown, and the fact that the court erroneously assigned to it a further material effect,' would not change the case, and could not have prejudiced the defendant upon the trial. The evidence he gave was directly material to the issue, for it tended to prove a fact essential to support it, and whatever else the court may have said upon the subject of its materiality, would impair no right whatever which the defendant could claim in the ease.
The defendantâ€™s counsel also requested the court to charge, â€?2d. That the jury must find not only that Mrs. Devine went into no house in Twelfth street, Williamsburg, between South Third and South Fourth streets, on the 9th July 1879, but that the prosecution has established that there was no house or place of assignation in said street between South Third and Fourth streets.â€?This was refused and an exception taken to the refusal. But this exception is clearly of no advantage to the defendant. For if Mrs. Devine went into no house in Twelfth street, Williamsburg, between South Third and South Fourth streets, on the 9th of July, 1879, then the defendant swore falsely in his testimony, and he could be convicted under the indictment for that false statement, even if the prosecution did not establish that there was no house or place of assignation in Twelfth street, between South Third and Fourth streets That fact of itself presented a material inquiry in the case, and wilfully false testimony given to establish it by the defendant, would create the crime of perjury. The court in answer to a question by one of the jurors, stated that they were bound by the specific date of the 9th of July, 1879, upon the inquiry whether there was a house of assignation within the bounds mentioned in the indictment and the evidence given by the defendant. And to that direction an exception was taken by his counsel. But as the whole of the issue presented by the indictment and the evidence which the defendant gave upon the trial before the referee, and that presented by the defense in the civil action, confined the time to the date of the 9th of July, 1879, and no uncertainty was in any respect connected with either of the statements relating to it, the court rightly confined the investigation of the jury to the question whether on that date there was such a house within the prescribed locality. This was no disadvantage to the defendant, for if the prosecution failed to satisfy the jury that there was no such house there on that date then he was entitled to his acquittal. And as he had given his evidence concerning it positively as to the date, it was his right to have the range of inquiry by the jury restricted in this manner. No injury whatever resulted to the defendant from the denial of the motion to strike out the evidence relating to the fact that the defendant had falsely sworn that he had seen the plaintiff in company with a person not her husband in August 1880, even if such a motion could be regularly made after the proof had been received in the case. For the court had already decided that perjury could not be assigned upon that evidence, which as completely disposed of it as though it had been stricken out of the case.
In neither one of the respects to which exception has been taken in the case, does there appear to have been any error to the prejudice of the defendant upon the trial. The offense was sufficiently charged by the indictment and made out by the proof, and the judgment accordingly should be affirmed.

1167671,PEOPLE ex rel. NUBELL v. BYRNES,1884-05,"Daniels, J.
The relator was arrested upon a warrant, issued by the governor in conformity to a requisition made upon him by the governor of the state of Illinois, for the arrest and return to that state of O. A. Hubell, who there stood charged with the crime of conspiracy committed in the county of Cook in the state of Illinois. The warrant recited that it had been represented by the governor of the state of Illinois that Hubell had been so charged ; that he had fled from justice in that state and taken refuge in the state of Hew York, and that the representations were accompanied by an indictment and affidavit, whereby the said O. A. Hubell is charged with the said crime, and with having fled from said state and taken refuge in the state of Hew York, which were certified by the governor of Illinois to be duly authenticated. It was upon these representations and evidence that the warrant was issued by the executive of this state, upon which the relator was arrested and held. At the instance of his counsel, alleging the arrest and detention to be illegal, the writ of habeas corpus was issued and the relator brought before one of the justices of this court. A return was, made to the writ setting forth that he was held in custody under the warrant issued by the governor' of the state of Hew York. To this return a demurrer was interposed, which was overruled by the justice before whom the hearing took place, and the writ itself was dismissed, and it was from the order dismissing,the writ that the appeal has been taken by the relator.
In support of the appeal it has been objected that the indictment itself set forth no offense, and that it was fatally defective by reason of the fact that it was presented against Hubell by the initial letters of his Christian names, without setting forth either one of such names. What the statements in the indictment may have been, describing the charge of conspiracy contained in it, were not made a part of the proof, for the copy of the indictment itself was not produced, but remained in the custody of the executive of the state, and all that can be known of its contents must be derived from the statements in the warrant, whose recitals set forth the fact that Hubell did stand charged with the crime of conspiracy, and that he was so charged by an indictment certified by the governor of Illinois to be duly authenticated. What the particular nature of the conspiracy was is not set forth, but it is to be inferred from the statements contained in the warrant, that the charge constituted a crime under the laws of the state of Illinois, and on evidence tending to prove the commission of the crime, the grand jury presenting the indictment, had concluded, that the crime charged had been committed by Nubell, the person named in the indictment. It is to be inferred from these facts that the case had been presented to the grand jury and the evidence produced in support of the charge had been considered ; that they had concluded that a crime had probably been committed, and had embodied the result of their conviction upon this subject in the indictment, legally and formally charging Â¡Nubell with the commission of a crime, under the laws of the state of Illinois. What those laws may be upon the subject has in no way been made to appear. Â¡Neither was it necessary that their provisions should be shown to support the application for the arrest and return of the person charged. Neither the Constitution nor the act of Congress under which the proceedings have, been taken, require that those laws shall be brought to the attention of the authorities of the state in which the accused person may have taken refuge. These are not subjects which have been committed to the consideration of the authorities of the state, but are subjects necessarily committed to the consideration and disposition of the judicial authorities of the state in which the indictment has been found.
This was clearly the design and intention of the Constitution of the United States and of the act of Congress enacted to carry the provision made upon this subject into practical effect. What the Constitution has required, and all that it has required to authorize proceedings of this description, is that the person proceeded against shall be charged in another state with treason, felony, or other crime, and that he shall have fled from justice, and shall be found in the other state. In these events it has been made imperative that the person charged shall, on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime. Const. U. S. art. 4, Â§ 2, sub. 3. This provision does not confer upon the authorities of the state in which the person may be found, the power to try or determine the question whether the charge may have been legally well founded or not. But that was left to be determined by the authorities of the state having jurisdiction of the crime. All that this provision has required to authorize the return of the alleged fugitive is that he shall be the person who has been charged, and that a criminal charge shall have been made against him. When these facts may be made to appear, then on demand of the executive authority of the state from which the person has fled, the Constitution has declared that he shall be delivered up to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime. And effect was given to this provision of the Constitution by an early enactment of Congress for that purpose. 1 U. S. Statutes at Large, 302. And since then the same enactment has been inserted as section 5278 in the U. S. Eevised Statutes. By this section it has been enacted that â€?whenever the executive authority of any state or territory demands any person asa fugitive from justice, of the executive authority of any state or territory to which such person has fled, and produces a copy of an indictment found, or an affidavit made, before a magistrate of any state or territory, charging the person demanded with having committed treason, felony, or other crime, certified as authentic by the governor or chief magistrate of the state or territory from whence the person so charged has fled, it shall be the duty of the executive authority of the state or territory to which such person has fled, to cause him to be arrested and secured, and to cause notice of the arrest to be given to the executive authority making such demand, or to the agent of such authority appointed to receive the fugitive, and to cause the fugitive to be delivered to such agent when he shall appear.â€?This section was enacted in such terms as to require the executive of the state in which the alleged fugitive may have taken refuge to cause him to be arrested and secured upon the criminal charge being authenticated by a copy of the indictment which has been found. That is all the evidence of the crime which the executive, under the law, has the right to demand. When the copy of the indictment certified to be authentic by the governor of the state from whence the person charged is shown to have fled is presented, it is made the absolute duty of the executive to whom this proof shall be made to cause the arrest of the individual so charged.
He is vested with no authority to examine into the charge, or the sufficiency of the indictment, but has been required to act solely upon the facts, that the charge has been embodied in the indictment found by the constituted authorities, and a copy of the indictment has been presented to him properly authenticated. This subject was considered by the Supreme Court of the United: States in the matter of Commonwealth of Kentucky v. William Dennison, Governor of the state of Ohio, 24 How. U. S. 66. The charge there was, as the indictment set it forth, that Willis Lago had committed a crime, by assisting a slave to escape from the state of Kentucky. The accused was alleged to have fled to and taken refuge within, the state of Ohio, and the executive of the state of Kentucky demanded his extradition and return from the Governor of the state of Ohio. This was not deemed to set forth a criminal offense as the law was understood in the state of Ohio, and an order or direction for the removal of the accused and his return to the state of Kentucky was refused. An application was thereupon made to the Supreme Court requiring the Governor of the state of Ohio to show cause why a mandamus should not be issued commanding him to cause the accused to be delivered up and removed to the state of Kentucky having jurisdiction over the crime with which he had been charged. The order was refused for the reason that the court did not consider its jurisdiction to be so extended as to require the performance of this duty through the means of the writ of mandamus. But in the consideration of the case the chief justice, in his opinion, declared the view of the court to be that the duty had been imposed upon the executive of the state of Ohio under the Constitution and the Act of Congress to cause the arrest and return of the fugitive. Upon this subject it was said that, â€œIt will be observed that the judicial acts which are necessary to authorize the demand, are plainly specified in the act of Congress, and the certificate of the executive authority is made conclusive as to their verity, when presented to the executive of the state where the fugitive is found. He has no right to look behind them, or to question them, or to look into the character of the crime specified in this judicial proceeding.
â€?The duty which he is to perform is, as we have already said, merely ministerialâ€”that is, to cause the party to be arrested and delivered to the agent or authority of the state where the crime was committed. It is said in the argument that the executive officer upon whom this demand is made, must have a discretionary executive power, because he must inquire and decide who is the person demanded. But this certainly is not a discretionary duty upon which he is to exercise any judgment, but is a mere ministerial dutyâ€”that is, to do the act required to be done by him, and such as every marshal and sheriff must perform when process either criminal or civil is placed in his hands to be served on the person named in it. And it never has been supposed that this duty involved any discretionary power, or made him anything more than a mere ministerial officer; and such is the position and character of the executive of the state under this law when the demand is made upon him, (and the requisite evidence produced. The governor has only to issue his warrant to an agent or officer to arrest the party named in the demand.â€?Id. 106-7.
These views are clearly in accordance with the language of the constitution and the act of Congress, and they deprive the executive of all discretion over the subject committed in this manner to his action. ""When the indictment has been found, charging a criminal offense, and that has' been certified to the executive of the state to which the fugitive is shown to have fled, the imperative duty is at once created to cause his arrest and his return; and its performance cannot be declined because the executive on whom the demand may be made, might consider the criminal charge not to be well founded, or not to have been stated with the clearness or precision required by the law or practice of his own state. Substantially the same was the view of the Court of Appeals of this state in People ex rel. Jourdan v. Donohue, 84 N. Y. 438. A somewhat different course was sanctioned and followed in People ex rel. Lawrence v. Brady, 56 N. Y. 183, where the person charged was relieved from his arrest by habeas corptts. practically upon the ground that the facts contained in the affidavits were not sufficient to create a crime as the law had been understood and administered in this state. But as that case proceeded simply upon the effect of the affidavits produced, it may be regarded as distinguishable from these other authorities. It certainly does not require, and would not justify a refusal, to exercise the authority, provided for, simply because the courts of this state, or the executive himself, might consider that the conspiracy charged by the indictment was not a criminal offense. Whether it may be or not, must depend upon the laws of the state of Illinois, under which the indictment has been found, and the administration of those laws by its tribunals.
The proceeding has also been resisted as unlawful, because of the omission to give the Christian names of the person charged with the offense in the indictment. But the courts of this state would not be justified in discharging the person from arrest on account of this omission. It may be a fully authorized mode of proceeding under the laws of the state of Illinois to charge a person with the commission of a crime in this manner. The presumption is in favor of the regularity of the indictment. It has so far passed the ordeal of the authorities of the state, and been acted upon and accepted in this form, and these acts are evidence of its regularity. It is not for the authorities of this state to determine the manner in which the state of Illinois shall conduct its legal proceedings. That is a matter committed entirely to the authorities of that state. Upon this subject it was said in Commonwealth of Kentucky v. Dennison (supra, p. 107): â€?Kentucky has an undoubted right to regulate the forms of pleadings and process in her own courts, in criminal as well as civil cases, and is not bound to conform of those of any other state. And whether the charge against lago is legally and sufficiently laid in this indictment according to the laws of Kentucky, is a judicial question to be decided by the courts of the state, and not by the executive authority of the state of Ohio.â€?It may possibly be that this was an irregular mode of proceeding, but whether it was or not, was not for the executive of this state to decide, neither have its courts authority to review that point. For as the indictment has been found, and properly certified, as the facts are stated in the warrant, that is all that can be required under the Constitution and the statute, to authorize the arrest and return of the person charged by the courts of this state.
An indictment is not necessarily to be declared inoperative, or void, even under the strict rules of the common law, because of its omission to designate the individual charged by the full Christian name. He may be indicted as the accused has been in this instance by giving the initials of his Christian name, and upon such an indictment he may be legally convicted and punished. This was held by the Court of Appeals of South Carolina in City Council v. King, 4 McCord, 487, where the court held the remedy of the accused to be that only of a plea in abatement. And if he failed to take the objection in that manner, that his right to insist upon it should afterwards be waived. A similar ruling was made in Smith v. State, 8 Ohio, 294. There the accused was named in the indictment W. E. Smith, and it was held that he could not object to the informality after pleading not guilty.
In the course of the opinion of Wood, J., it was said in 2 Hawk. c. 23, Â§ 125, â€?If there be no addition, or a wrong one, the defendant can take advantage of it by plea in abatement only, and Hawkins is sustained by 1st Sidefine, p. 247, Rex v. Warren, and by 2 Inst. 670.â€?And it is further said, â€œIf he pleads over, he thereby waives all objections to the indictment on that account. So, if there be no Christian name, or a wrong one, or no surname, or a wrong one, the defendant can take advantage of it by plea in abatement only, and if he plead over he waives the objection.â€?Id. 276. And the same general principle was declared in Com. v. Dedham, 16 Mass. 141, 146 ; State v. Brunell, 29 Wis. 435, 438 ; and it was also considered to be the only manner in which a misnomer could be taken advantage of in Saulsbury v. Gillett, 3 Ill.; 2 Scan. 290 ; and in Carpenter v. State, 8 Mo. 291. And that was the course of practice followed in Gerrish v. State, 53 Ala. 476. The other cases relied upon in support of the appeal, decided by the Supreme Court of the state of Illinois, are in no respect at variance with this practice. Where the party sued or proceeded against is misnamed, or his name is defectively given,' the mode prescribed for taking advantage of the defect is by plea or answer; and in reply to that it may be alleged and shown that the party has usually designated himself by the' name in which he may have been charged, and that will form a legal answer to the objection.
City Council v. King, supra, 489, 2 Hale, 238. What was urged and said upon this subject on the motion to quash the indictment against Dorsey forms no substantial exception to this rule, for the proceedings there were wholly before the court in which the indictment was pending, as it of course would be if it were put in a more formal shape by plea of abatement. In either case the tribunal to correct the informality is that in which the indictment shall be pending. It appertains to its proper jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case, and cannot be a legal ground for the discharge of the accused from arrest in a proceeding of this character. That results not only from the authorities, but also from the Constitution and laws of the United States prescribing and regulating this mode of proceeding. That has reserved no such authority either to the executive or the tribunals of this state. But when the indictment has been found, although it might be regarded as defective as the criminal law is administered in this state, the executive is required to act upon it, when a copy properly authenticated has been presented to him, leaving it, as the law clearly does, to the courts of the other states to determine the- legal effect or regularity of the proceedings. This intent is further manifest by section 5279 of the United States Be vised Statutes. For it is provided that â€?Any agent so appointed who receives the fugitive into his custody shall be empowered to transport him to the state or territory from which he has fled. And every person who, by force, sets at liberty or rescues the fugitive from such agent while so transporting him, shall be fined not more than $500, or imprisoned not more than one year.â€?The law has created a specific and well-defined proceeding by which the provision of the Constitution on this subject is to be carried into effect; and when the provisions of the Federal statute appear to have been formally complied with, the courts of this state are not authorized to interpose and release the person arrested, because their views, or mode of criminal procedure, may not have been complied with in the state in which the indictment has been found. The proceeding is wholly statutory, and when the provisions of the statute have been complied with, the governor is imperatively required to cause the arrest of the person charged, and deliver him up to be returned to the state in which the criminal charge may be â€?pending against him. And no court has the power to interfere and prevent the exercise of this authority, when the steps required to be taken have been followed in the case, and brought to its attention. If the indictment is to be quashed, or in any other manner defeated or set aside, that is to be done by the action of the tribunal in which it may be pending. The subject is exclusively for its consideration, and all the authorities require that the accused shall be taken before that tribunal for its action in the premises.
The cases in which the arrest of persons has been considered unauthorized, by reason of differences in their names, are not applicable to this proceeding, for it is governed wholly by the Federal Constitution and statute. They have prescribed the practice and mode of proceeding, and the execution of the statute cannot be defeated, because the courts, acting under the authority of the common law, might find it necessary to observe and follow a different rule. The question in this class of cases must be whether the Federal law has been complied with, and where that may appear to have been done, the courts cannot defeat its operations merely because a different mode of proceeding would be considered essentia,], for the arrest of persons charged with crime under the laws of this state.
But, while the warrant of the governor appears to have been authorized as that was required to be done by the Federal statute, it did not follow that the relator could be arrested under it. It issued for the arrest of O. A. Hubell, and it cannot certainly be said that it would authorize the arrest of Otto A. Hubell, for the person known by the latter name cannot surely be said, from the identity of a part of the name, to be the individual known by the name of O. A. Hubell. That was necessarily a matter of proof. The relator has the right to controvert the fact that he was the person mentioned in the warrant as O. A. Hub ell, and, by his objections to the return of the writ of habeas corpus, he did in effect present that objection.
What should then have been done, if the facts would justify it, was the answer that Otto A. Hubell and O. A. Hu bell were one and the same individual, and that consequently the relator was the person intended to be arrested and returned by virtue of the executive warrant. This was an issue either party had the right to present, and to have a judicial determination of his identity with the person whose arrest was authorized by the warrant. And by section 2039 of the Code of Civil Procedure the court was not only empowered, but required to make that investigation. That was not done, but the demurrer was overruled and the writ of habeas corpus dismissed. This direction requires to be corrected. ' The order should be reversed, and an order entered sustaining the demurrer, with liberty to the respondents to amend their return by adding the statements, and establishing the fact by proof, that the relator is the same person named in the warrant under which he is now held in custody. And in case that proof shall be made, then it will follow of course that the writ should be dismissed, and the relator returned to the state of Illinois.

1167716,PEOPLE v. BURNS,1884-06,"Follett, J.
The defendant was convicted before the court of Sessions of Jefferson county, of burglary in the third degree. The defendant appeals from the judgment, and asks for a reversal and a new trial, upon the ground that errors were' committed in the reception and rejection of evidence, and in the charge to the jury.
About 6 A. M., December 9, 1883 (Sunday), the defendant was found by a police officer in a grist mill.
In the office of the mill were a safe and money drawer, which some one had attempted by violence to open. These facts were not denied on the trial. Defendant testified that he entered the mill,- but how, when, or for what purpose, he said he was unable to explain by reason of intoxication on the occasion in question.
The defendant was arrested at Ms motherâ€™s house, about an hour after he was discovered in the mill. The officer making the arrest testified that he was met by the defendantâ€™s mother at the outside door of the hall, who upon inquiry said defendant was within.
The mother went back into the kitchen, apparently to call her son, and upon returning said, â€?He (defendant) had gone out of the back door.â€?Hpon reeeiviug the answer, the officer started to enter the kitchen, the mother trying to stop him, and on reaching the kitchen, found defendant concealed behind a door about six feet from where the conversation occurred between the officer and the mother.
The remark above quoted was objected to by the defendant, upon the ground that the declaration of the witness was not made in defendantâ€™s presence and was incompetent.
The evidence was admissible, because, (1) The facts justified the inference that the answer was made by defendantâ€™s direction. At first the mother told the officer the truth, but after returning from the room where the son was found, told a falsehood in defendantâ€™s interest, and with the evident intent of enabling the defendant to escape; (2) The facts justified the inference that the defendant, who was concealed behind an open door, but six feet from the mother, was within hearing, and unless he wished to be bound by her remark should have spoken; (3) The falsehood of the mother, told under the circumstances described, and her attempt to prevent the officer from entering the room where the defendant was concealed, justified the inference that they were acting with a common purpose and design to enable defendant to escape, and the acts and declarations of the mother were for this reason admissible against the defendant. Kelley v. People, 55 N. Y. 565.
One of the defendantâ€™s witnesses testified on cross-examination that he had been three times convicted for being drunk and disorderly (misdemeanors).
The defendant objected to this evidence, on the ground that it was immaterial. It was immaterial to the issue, but was admissible as affecting the credibility of the witness. Code Civ. Proc. Â§ 832; Pen. Code, Â§ 714.
The defendant insists that the sections cited, simply changed the mode of proving the fact of conviction, but do not affect the common law rule of the competency of the particular conviction offered to be proved ; and that unless the conviction is for an infamous offense, or for an offense which directly affects moral character, proof of the conviction is incompetent for the purpose of affecting credibility.
Before the adoption of these sections the rule as to the class of convictions which might be proved to affect credibility, was not uniform, and depended mainly upon the opinion of the court as to whether the particular conviction was for an infamous or immoral offense.
In Carpenter v. Nixon, 5 Hill, 260 ; Lake v. People, 1 Parker, 495 ; affâ€™d, 12 N. Y. 358 ; People v. Satterlee, 5 Hun, 167, it was held that the fact that a witness had been convicted of petit larceny (a misdemeanor) was competent as affecting credibility; while in Greaton v. Smith, 1 Daly, 380, it was held incompetent to prove that the witness had been convicted of intoxication (a misdemeanor) for such purpose.
In People v. Noelke, 94 N. Y. 137; 1 N. Y. Crim. 495 ; the defendant was sworn in his own behalf, and was asked on cross-examination if he had been convicted in a Federal court of mailing lottery circulars (a misdemeanor under the statute of the United States). The question was objected to, but the witness was required to answer, and answered in the affirmative. This was held competent under the sections above cited. This decision is decisive on this question.
The design and the effect of the sections is to establish a uniform rule, and permit the conviction for any crime to be proved, and whether it should affect the credibility of the witness is a question for the jury.
Such is the rule in England, â€?A witness may be questioned as to whether he has been convicted of any felony or misdemeanor.â€?Taylor's Ev. 6th ed. p. 1244, Â§ 1294. Any other rule would be difficult of application, and dependent upon the view of the trial judge as to whether the particular conviction should or might affect credibility.
In the opinion of this court, those convictions for drunkenness and disorderly conduct tend to affect the credibility and moral character of the witness; but the extent to which it should affect, is dependent upon the circumstances of the offense. In some cases the conviction of a particular misdemeanor might not and should not impair the credibility of a witness while a conviction of the same statutory misdemeanor under other circumstance should and would affect credibility.
A witness employed in the mill who carried the key to, and whose duty it was each evening to close and lock a particular outside door, testified that he did not remember doing so on the evening before the burglary, but that it was his custom to do so every night. The defendant objected to proving the custom of the witness, but stated no ground, except as it may be inferred that it was on the ground that the custom was incompetent. Without stopping to consider the sufficiency of the objection, or whether the evidence was not competent within the rule, that presumably a person performs a particular act which he has long and regularly performed at stated times at short Ã­ntevals, as a duty, and in the regular course of Ms daily vocation (Skilbeck v. Garbett, 7 Q.B.N.S. 846; Dana v. Kemble, 19 Pick. 112 ; People v. Bush, 3 Parker, 552), it is sufficient to say on this question, that McDonald and Graves testified they together closed and left the mill at 9 n. m., before the burglary ; and McDonald swears he observed that this particular door was locked, and Graves testified that his attention was called to the fact that McDonald examined the door.
The defendant though sworn in his own behalf, did not testify that he entered through an open door, and no evidence of any kind was given or offered tending to show that such might have been the fact. â€?The rule undoubtedly is, that when a fact is conclusively proved by competent evidence so that the court can see no prejudice or injury could possibly have resulted from the admission of incompetent evidence to prove the same fact, its admission will not be cause for interfering with the result or reversing a judgment, but the rule is to be cautiously applied in criminal cases.â€?Coleman v. People, 58 N. Y. 555, 561. Erroneous rulings ou a trial by jury in civil or criminal cases should be disregarded on appeal if it clearly appears that the appellant was' not injured thereby. Shorter v. People, 2 N. Y. 193 ; Patterson v. People, 46 Barb. 625, 627; Page v. Ellsworth, 44 Barb. 636. Such was the rule before the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that on appeal the court must give judgment without regard to technical errors, defects or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the appellant (Â§ 542,) and the rules of evidence are the same in civil and criminal cases, except as otherwise provided by the Code Crim. Pro. (Â§ 392).
No error was committed in the direction to the jury as to the effect which should be given to the defendantâ€™s evidence that he was intoxicated upon the occasion in question. The evidence bearing upon this question was recited by the court, and the jury plainly charged in this connection, that they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to commit a crime. This in effect was three times charged; and the court also said, â€?Y ou may take into consideration the intoxication of the defendant in determining the intent with which the defendant entered the building in question.â€?It was unnecessary to again repeat the instruction and employ the language of counsel.
No errors were committed in refusing to instruct the jury as to the rules applicable to cases resting on circumstantial evidence. This was not such a case. The mill was entered by violence. The money-drawer and the lock of the safe had been tampered with. The defendant was found in the mill, and was unable to give a satisfactory explanation of his presence there. These facts were testified to by eye-witnesses.
The judgment must be affirmed, the stay vacated, and the sheriff directed to carry into effect the judgment of the court of Sessions.

1167718,PEOPLE ex rel. DEVOE v. KELLY,1884-11,"Danforth, J.
After conviction at the Otsego Sessions of the crime of assault in the third degree, the relator was sentenced to be imprisoned at hard labor in state prison, for the term of one year. He was afterward brought before the county judge upon habeas corpus, and on return made by the sheriff that the relator was in custody under this judgment of conviction, he was remanded, and the sheriff directed to carry out the judgment of conviction and sentence. Upon appeal to the General Term, of the Supreme Court, the order of the county judge was affirmed, and it was further ordered that the original judgment rendered by the court of Sessions be carried into execution.
The court below was of opinion that the sentence was without authority of law and void, that the offense was a misdemeanor and punishable only by imprisonment in a penitentiary or county jail, for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars, or by both, as provided by section 15, of the Penal Code. In this conclusion we concur. But as the court of Sessions exceeded its jurisdiction, its judgment cannot be enforced. It follows therefore, that the order of the county judge, and the judgment of the General Term, so far as they direct the judgment of the court of Sessions to be carried into effect, should be reversed.
But the conviction is still valid, and the prisoner not entitled to his discharge. He should be remanded to the sheriff of Otsego county, in order that the court of Sessions may deal with him according to law. People ex rel. Bork v. Gilbert and People v. Bork, 2 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 177. So far, therefore, as the order of the county judge directs the prisoner to be remanded to the custody of the sheriff it is right, as is also the judgment of the General Term, so far as it affirms such direction, and to that extent they should be affirmed.
All concur, except Rapallo, J., absent.

1167725,PEOPLE ex rel. KNOWLTON v. SADLER,1884-09,"Vann, J.
The return shows that, on the 21st of August, 1884, at a court of Special Sessions, held by a justice of the peace, the relator was duly convicted of the crime of petit larceny, and was thereupon sentenced to imprisonment in the Onondaga county penitentiary for the term of one year. A commitment in the usual form, reciting these facts, constitutes the authority and true cause of the imprisonment of the relator.
By section 56 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, jurisdiction is conferred upon courts of Special Sessions to hear and determine certain charges, and among others petit larceny. By section 535 of the Penal Code, petit larceny is declared to be a misdemeanor, and by section 15 a person convicted of a crime declared to be a misdemeanor, for which no other punishment â– is specially prescribed by statute, is punishable by imprisonment in a penitentiary or county jail for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than $500, or by both. There seems to be no other provision of law now in force fixing the punishment for this offense.
By section 717 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the greatest punishment that can be inflicted by a court of Special Sessions upon any offender convicted before it, is a fine not exceeding $50, and imprisonment not exceeding six months. The magistrate who imposed sentence upon the relator apparently had in mind section 15 of the Penal Code, and disregarded section 717 of the Criminal Code. The sections cited from the Penal Code do not expressly nor impliedly repeal the section cited from the Criminal Code, as will be seen by comparing the last section of both Codes. Each Code provides that when construed in connection with other statutes, it must be deemed to have been enacted on the fourth day of January, 1881. Criminal Code, Â§ 963; Penal Code, Â§ 727. Nor does it necessarily follow that' the two Codes are inconsistent, for it may have been the intention of the Legislature when it conferred exclusive jurisdiction upon courts of Special Sessions to hear in the first instance a large number of offenses, to prevent those courts, usually held by inexperienced men, from inflicting as severe punishment for an offense as could be imposed by a court of record upon the removal of the case thereto. Code Crim. Pro. Â§Â§ 56, 57.
It is conceded on the part of the people that the court of Special Sessions had no power to sentence the relator for the term of one year. It is, however, contended that the whole sentence is not void, but only so much thereof as was unauthorized, arid that hence the prisoner should be detained for the longest term that the court could have legally imposed.
If under any circumstance, or upon any state of facts, the court of Special Sessions, had power to inflict the punishment specified in the commitment, it might be held that the error was not one that could be reviewed upon habeas corpus. People ex rel. Devoe v. Kelly, 32 Hun, 536. In such a case the relator might not be entitled to the writ, because his detention would be by virtue of the final judgment of a competent tribunal of criminal jurisdiction, and hence his only remedy would be to appeal, and have his sentence modified or corrected in that way. Id.; Code of Civ. Pro. Â§ 2016. But this commitment shows upon its face that it was issued to enforce a judgment that the court not only had no power to render, but was actually prohibited from rendering. The judgment was not merely erroneous. It was not merely unauthorized. It was forbidden by law. The statute says that the court of Special Sessions may render judgment â€?of fine or imprisonment, or both, but the fine cannot exceed fifty dollars, nor the imprisonment six months.â€?Code Cr. Pro. Â§ 717.
The judgment is, therefore, one that the court could not under any circumstances have pronounced, and is as absolutely void as if the relator had been sentenced to death. People ex rel. Tweed v. Liscomb, 60 N. Y. 559, 568. It is my duty to' order the discharge of the prisoner.
Note.â€”There is an obvious distinction between the present case and People ex rel. Devoe v. Kelly, ante, p. 428. In the case at bar, the relator was undergoing a void sentence, in the latter case the prisoner was still in custody of the sheriff, under a valid judgment, and the void sentence had not yet been executed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1167729,PEOPLE v. RYLAND,1884-10,"Miller, J.
The prisoner, in conjunction with her husband and one Woodbury, was indicted for the crime of forgery in the third degree, and, being separately tried, was convicted of the offense. The evidence showed that all of the defendants combined and co-operated in the commission of the crime. At the close of the testimony counsel for the defendant requested the court to advise the jury to acquit the defendant on the ground that she was the wife of the co-defendant Edward 0. Ryland and was under the coercion, of her husband at the time when the offense was committed; that all that was done by her, viz: the delivery of the check to her husband and subsequently receiving a part of the proceeds of the forgery, was done in her husbandâ€™s presence, and the presumption of law is that she acted under his control and direction. This was refused, and an exception was taken by the defendantâ€™s counsel to the decision of the court. The rule undoubtedly is that whatever of a criminal nature, the wife does in the presence of the husband, is presumed to be compelled by him. 1 Bish. Crim. Law, 7th ed. Â§ 359. But this presumption is prima facie and not conclusive, and if it appears that she was not urged or drawn to the offense by him but was an inciter of it she is liable as well as he. Seiler v. People, 77 N. Y. 413; Goldstein v. People, 82 N. Y. 233.
There was no direct proof upon the trial that the defendant acted under the coercion of her husband in committing the offense; on the contrary the proof tended to show that she acted on her own responsibility and voluntarily incited and aided in the consummation of the crime. There is evidence showing that she first suggested to her husband and the accomplice the idea of obtaining the check; that she went out with her husband, and returned after an absence of four hours with a check for six dollars, which she had procured, and delivered the same to her husband and that the erasure on the cheek was made in her presence. This check was obtained upon representations by her that she wished to purchase the same because the post office was closed and she could not obtain an order there, and that she desired to send it that evening to her sister or mother in Philadelphia. This representation was utterly false, as the proof showed that the check was intended and used for another and a different purpose, and there is testimony tending to show she delivered it to her husband for the purpose of being altered. He was not present when she procured the check and it was proved that she subsequently received a considerable portion of the avails thereof as her share for her participation in the crime. There is no direct evidence that she acted under the influence of her husband or that he directly or otherwise compelled her to engage in the transaction. As the case stands it is not a legitimate inference that the husband directed her action and that she was coerced by him. The most that can be claimed, giving a construction to the evidence most favorable to the defendant, is that it was a question of fact for the jury. Ho requests were made to charge the jury in regard to it and the presumption is that it was fairly submitted to their consideration. We think there was no error committed in refusing the request considered.
There is no ground for the contention that the defendant merely delivered a valid check to her husband and thereby committed no unlawful act, as it was established beyond controversy that she was a pcirtioeps- criminis at the outset as well as in the final consummation of the crime. If the delivery of the check was an innocent act no reason exists why she should have received a large portion of the avails realized from it after it had been altered. They did not belong to her and she could only have received them as one of the instigators of the crime.
The position taken, that the defendant is not accountable for any act done by her husband in her presence and especially as the act consisted only in making erasures in the check which was not an offense against the statute, and as the offense consisted in changing the amount, is without merit. The offense of the defendant was her general participation in the transaction in originating, aiding and carrying out the plan by means of which the forgery was committed, and her presence, when a portion of the check was erased and, as subsequently appears, with knowledge of the purpose for which it was done, was an act toward the commission of the crime for which she was responsible if she acted without her husbandâ€™s coercion. The erasures were preliminary to the subsequent alteration and it is to be presumed from the evidence that they were made for that purpose.
We think there was no error committed by the court in refusing to advise the jury to acquit the defendant on the ground that there was no evidence in the case tending to prove that she committed any unlawful act, except that given by Crawford, the accomplice, and he was not corroborated. The rule of the common law in regard to the corroboration of the testimony of an accomplice has been changed by the Code of Civil Procedure and it is provided by section 899, â€?that a conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice, unless he be corroborated by such other evidence as tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime.â€?There is certainly some testimony, as we have seen, which tends to connect the defendant with the forgery alleged in the indictment. Aside from the testimony of the accomplice, it was proved that the defendant originally applied for and obtained the check for six dollars, as already stated; that this check was altered by inserting another name as payee, and by raising the amount, and, as altered, the money was obtained on it. The defendant was thus placed in a position connecting her with the commission of the offense and was called upon to make an explanation of the facts. The circumstances were suspicious, and, unexplained it is fairly to be inferred that she w-as one of the originators of and connected with the forgery Taking these conceded facts in connection with the other proof showing her presence when the erasure was made and that she received a portion of the avails, it is manifest that the testimony tended to connect her with the offense and thus corroborated the evidence of the accomplice. The subject is fully considered in the opinion of the General Term by Davis, P. J., and further elaboration is not required.
There is no ground for claiming that the defendant should only be prosecuted as an accessory before the fact. She was a principal in the transaction, according to the evidence, from the very beginning, and as such was chargeable as the maker of the forged instrument.
The judgment should be affirmed.

1167720,PEOPLE v. STONE,1884-02,"Dykman, J.
It is an ancient and salutary rule of law that a conviction for the crime of willful and corrupt perjury cannot be secured and sustained on the uncorroborated testimony of one witness. The underlying principle of this rule is that if there be but one witness to prove the allegation of falsity, then oath is placed against oath and it remains doubtful where the truth lies, the oath of the accused which is alleged , to be false being sufficient to counterpoise the testimony of a single witness. Formerly the testimony of two witnesses was requisite to a conviction, but the rule has been relaxed. How what is required is evidence sufficient to counterbalance the oath of the defendant, and the legal presumption of his innocence. The testimony of the single witness for the prosecution must be corroborated by material and independent facts or circumstances sufficient to destroy the equilibrium produced by the two oaths.
Tested by these fundamental and material rules, the testimony in this case is insufficient to sustain the conviction of the defendant.
The. perjury set up in the indictment is false swearing to the payment of money to Mrs. Booraem, and she testified to its falsity. There was much testimony adduced on the trial respecting a receipt which Stone had produced on the main trial, but he is not indicted for false swearing in reference to the receipt or the signature it bears. That testimony is not therefore corroborative for the prosecution here. If all the exhibits produced by the defendant on the trial were forged it is quite immaterial here. The only question here is whether the defendant committed willful and corrupt perjury when he swore on the trial at Special Term that he had paid Mrs. Booraem the money.
The indictment contains no charge that Stone testified in any way respecting the signatures to the two receipts. The allegations are that the receipts were false and forged and that the defendant produced them; but the indictment is for perjury in making a false oath that he had paid money and not for swearing that the receipts were genuine.
The accused was therefore called on to answer the charge of perjury contained in the indictment, and the public prosecutor was called on for proof of that ofÃ­ense, and when he produced one single witness to prove that the money had not been paid, he had taken but one step toward the conviction of the defendant. He had then produced an equilibrium which he was required to destroy, and that destruction could not be accomplished by proof that the defendant had committed- the crime of perjury without proof of material and independent facts or circumstances tending directly to corroborate the testimony of the main and only witness; on the question of payment he could not require a conviction.
The argument for the prosecution seems to be that because Stone testified to the payment of the money and produced in corroboration of his testimony a receipt which is shown to be false and fabricated, that makes against his testimony, and is sufficient confirmation of the single witness to justify the conviction. But does that prove any more than the failure of the receipt to corroborate the testimony of Stone ? If that be all then it does not assist the prosecution. What the law required was confirmation of the single witness. If Stone provided fabricated receipts, they may fail to support him, but they fail also to corroborate the testimony of the people.
On the whole testimony the conclusion is reached that there was not sufficient confirmatory proof in corroboration of the single witness to justify the conviction.
The judgment of conviction should be reversed.

The Court of Appeals have settled the question presented by this appeal adversely to the appellant. Assuming that there was proof that the seduction was accomplished under a promise of marriage conditioned upon pregnancy resulting therefrom, such a promise is sufficient under chapter 111, Laws of 1848. It is not necessary that the promise should be a valid and binding one between the parties. The offense consists in seducing and having illicit connection with an unmarried female under promise of marriage. It is enough that a promise is made which is a consideration for or inducement to the intercourse. Kenyon v. The People, 26 N. Y. 203. This case is approved in Boyce v. People, 55 N. Y. 644. In that case the promise was one conditioned upon a consent to illicit connection. That consent, based upon such a promise was within the law. It was held, in Armstrong v. People, 70 N. Y. 38, that the question was not presented by the case. The court cited with approval the cases cited, Boyce v. People, and Kenyon v. People.
The conviction should therefore be affirmed.

1167713,PEOPLE v. PETMECKY,1884-10,"Smith, P. J.
The defendant was convicted of tne murder of Pauline Froitzheim. The deceased was the wife of Andrew Froitzheim, a resident of the city of Auburn. The homicide occurred in the afternoon of June 1, 1883, at the house in which deceased lived with her husband.
The defendant, who was examined at the trial as a witness in his own behalf, admitted in his testimony that at the time and place referred to, he had a conflict with the deceased, in which he struck her several blows upon the head with a revolver and a hatchet, and as the uncontradicted testimony showed beyond a doubt that the blows caused the death of the deceased, there was no question, but that the defendant was the author of the homicide. He claimed that he acted in self-defense, and it is now urged by his counsel that the verdict finding him guilty of murder is against the weight of evidence.
The argument of the defendantâ€™s counsel also rests upon several exceptions which it is claimed point to error.
As we may order a new trial independent of the exceptions, if we are satisfied that the verdict is against the evidence or against law, or that justice requires a new trial (Code of Cr. Pro. Â§ 527, as amended L. 1882, ch. 360, pi 499), we will examime the evidence before taking up the exceptions. The responsibility thus thrown upon us compels a careful and somewhat minute review of the testimony.
On the part of the prosecution the testimony tended to establish the following facts and circumstances : The husband of the deceased, who was employed in a neighboring factory, had left his wife, soon after noon on the day of the homicide, engaged in her usual household dxxties, and on his return home about five hours later, he found the house closed and locked, except the blinds of one window, which he opened and through it climbed into the kitchen. On the kitchen floor were spots of blood and bloody tracks leading from the bed-room. On going into the bed-room he noticed three drawers of a bureaxx open and their contents stirred up. Under the bed was a hatchet, which Froitzheim had left in the woodshed that morning. It was covered with blood. In the adjoining sitting-room was the dead body of his wife, lying in a pool of blood. There were l'agged wounds upon the head, which a subsequent examination by physicians decided to be at least twenty in number, some appealing to have been made by the corner of a blunt instrument, and one by a hammer smashing down the flesh. Underneath many of the wounds the skull was fractured, and in one instance there was a complete depression of the bones on to the brain itself. The throat was discolored, showing finger prints over the carotid arteries. In the. opinion of one of the physicians there were six or eight of the wounds either of which was sufficient to produce death. Hear the body was a bowl containing bloody water, standing on a chair; a revolver loaded, except one chamber; a cartridge from the same and a piece broken off from the butt of the revolver. On the pistol were blood and several hairs, the color of the hair of the deceased. There were also,, near the body, or on the floor, a ring not belonging to any of the household, a couple of buttons and a clasp from a neck-chain worn by the deceased. On further search, it was discovered that the keys to the outer doors were gone, and a bank-book on the Auburn Savings Bank, belonging to Martin Froitzheimer, a son of the deceased, a small sum of money, two watches and chains, the neck-chain spoken of, a woolen wrapper, an overcoat and two or three letters were missing. Blood was found in the sitting-room, on the door, the ceiling and the wall-paper; in the bed-room, on papers in a bureau drawer; and above stairs on the garret door, just above the bolt, and on the tray of a trunk in a bed-room in the chamber.
There were neighbors living near, but none of them heard any noise in the house. The letters taken were from Petmecky, the defendant, who had formerly lived in Froitzheimâ€™s family.
Between 7 and 8 oâ€™clock the next morning, Petmecky appeared at a bank in Albany, with the bank-book of Martin Froitzheim, saying that he came from Auburn and was going to Philadelphia, and that he wanted to get money on it, for which purpose he then signed a draft with the name of Martin Froitzheim.
Shortly after leaving the bank, he was arrested by a detective, and on being charged with the murder of a woman at Auburn, he told the detective he had not been in Auburn, and that a man in New York gave him the bank-book and told him to go to Albany and get the money on it. On being asked his name, he said it was Nathan Heymann. He had on the missing overcoat and wrapper or undershirt. On removing his overcoat, his coat and shirt showed blood-stains. â€?On his way to the police office, he attempted to escape from the detective. At the police office, he was searched, and several of the other missing articles were found upon him.
He was brought to Auburn and lodged in jail. While there he proposed to a fellow prisoner a plan to overpower the sheriff, when he came to the cell, and make their escape, and at a late day, a letter was intercepted, written by him to a person outside asking to be furnished with instruments by which he could break jail and escape before his trial should come on.
It appeared in evidence that the defendant come to Auburn from the city of Hew York on the day preceding the homicide. The day before leaving Hew York he changed his boarding-place to one about a mile and a half distant, and from the latter place he started for Auburn. The evidence tended to show that he avoided his old acquaintances in Auburn, and that, before going to Froitzheimâ€™s house, he made inquiries, for the apparent purpose of learning at what time he would be likely to find Mrs. Froitzheim there alone.
The testimony of the defendant tended to show that he was born in Germany in 1861, and first come to this country in 1880. Being distantly connected with Froitzheim he went to his house and lived in his family several months. He testified that the first morning he was there the deceased told him she loved him and that she wanted to leave her husband and have the defendant go and live with her in the west; that he continued there about five months, she daily renewing her protestations of love for him, and that he, not liking to hear them, left Froitzheimâ€™s house and boarded elsewhere in Auburn, about a year, when he went to Cleveland, and from there to Manitoba. Thence he went back to Germany, and from there returned to Hew York City in February, 1883. In May, he married, in Madison county, a Swiss girl, whom he meet on his last voyage to Hew York, and after a few days he absconded, leaving his wife in Syracuse without providing her any means of support, and returned to Hew York, where he remained until he came to Auburn, the day before the homicide. He testified that previous to his returning to Germany he received from Mrs. Froitzheim as many as twenty-five letters, all of which he destroyed when he left for Germany; and that about eight days before he left Hew York, he received a letter from her asking him to come to Auburn and enjoining upon him not to make his visit known, and that he came accordingly; that he went to her house in the forenoon and spent an hour or two there; that she urged him to elope with her, and he refused ; that he went to a neighboring brewery, while the husband was at home to dinner; that he returned to the house and found Mrs. F. dressed ready to go; that she again urged him, and he finally told her he was married; that' she then flew into a passion and assaulted him-; that he struck her with his revolver to free himself; that she again attacked him and in the struggle some of the buttons of his coat were torn off and the revolver fell to the floor; that she snatched it and saying that she did not care what became of her, she threatened to shoot him first and then herself; that he, being in great fear, and as he thought in imminent danger, struck her with a hatchet which was lying near the stove to which she had forced him back, and that he finally went from the house leaving her sitting in a chair, holding the revolver in her hand.
The defendant admitted that he carried away the overcoat, and he testified on his direct examination that in the train from Auburn to Syracuse he found in the overcoat pocket, a bankbook, the two watches and a cigar-holder. On his cross-examination'he stated that he took the bank-book out of the bureau drawer, and that he took one of the watches as it was hanging up in the room and did not know where he got the other watch.
On his direct examination he said that when he found the bank-book in the pocket he thought how he could get it back to Auburn, and he concluded he had best take a ticket to Albany and send it back.
He also said that at Albany he went into a saloon kept by a German and told him he had a bank-book he wanted to send back to Auburn. On his cross-examination he testified that his object in taking the bank-book from the drawer was to get money to return to New York with and to. enable him to stay there. Berger, the German whose saloon the defendant visited in Albany, testified that the defendant told him he was short of money and had a bank-book with him on a bank in Auburn, and would like to know if he could raise some money on it, and the defendant, on cross-examination, admitted that he recollected telling Berger so.
The defendant also testified to having met Mrs. F. at Syracuse in April, 1882, at her invitation, and having occupied the same room with her, at a hotel, two or three days and nights, in respect to which he was corroborated by the landlord and another witness, to the extent that they recollected the fact of a young man and a woman older than the man, who were strangers to them being there on that occasion, and they recognized the defendant as the man, and they thought a photograph of Mrs. F., shown them at the trial, was a likeness of the woman.
The defendant also testified that Mrs. F. sent him ten dollars by mail to Cleveland, to defray his expenses to Syracuse on the occasion above referred to, and that on another occasion she sent him twenty-five dollars. The husband of the deceased testified that those moneys were sent to the defendant in reply to his letters asking for a loan of money ; that the money sent was furnished by the witness; and that the letters asking for it were in witnessâ€?house shortly before the homicide, and were among those which he missed as above stated.
There was much other testimony given, but enough has been stated, to show that the credit of the defendant, as a witness, was seriously impaired by his self-contradictions, and that if the jury disbelieved his version of what occurred at Froitzheimâ€™s house on the day of the homicide, so far as it was uncorroborated (as they properly might), the evidence fully warranted their verdict. Giving to the defendant the benefit of every reasonable doubt, they were authorized to find either that the deliberate and premeditated purpose of the defendant was to take the life of his victim, or that it was to plunder the house, in which latter case, as the value of the property taken by him was shown to exceed twenty-five dollars, the homicide, if committed by him while engaged in the felonious taking, was murder in the first degree, although perpetrated without a design to affect death. Penal. Code, Â§ 183. The case was submitted to the jury by the learned judge in both of these aspects, and we are constrained to say that we see no cause for disturbing the verdict as being against the weight of evidence.
The point is made by the appellantâ€™s counsel that in the examination of one Treat, called as a juror and challenged by the defendant for principal cause, the court interfered with the free expression of the jurorâ€™s opinion by charging him as to the law in criminal cases generally, and inferentially in the particular case about to be tried. The juror, having answered the defendantâ€™s counsel that he had read and talked about the case and formed an opinion respecting it, which he thought would require evidence to remove, also said that he thought he could try the case unbiased by that opinion. He was then asked, â€?If the evidence was pretty nearly balanced, would your opinion influence your verdict ?â€?He answered, â€?I donâ€™t think it would.â€?The court then said, â€œYou reflected, I suppose, that you do not find a verdict in a criminal case upon the balance of the evidence, but that the evidence must be such as to remove every reasonable doubt of guilt?â€?The juror answered, â€œYes.â€?No exception was taken to the remark of the judge, and we discover nothing in it improper or that could prejudice the defendant. Besides, the juror did not sit, he having been challenged peremptorily by the defendant.
It does not appear that the defendantâ€™s peremptory challenges were exhausted. The juror not having been of the panel, the question whether there was error in his examination is not brought up by this appeal. The appeal is to be heard upon the judgment-roll (Code of Cr. Pr. Â§ 517), and that is to contain no copy of the minutes of a challenge, except such as may have been interposed to the panel of the trial jury, or to a juror who participated in the verdict (Id. Â§ 485, sub. 3). A like limitation is put by the Code of Criminal Procedure upon the right to except to a ruling made upon the trial of a challenge (Â§ 455).
The examination of the wife of the defendant as a witness against her husband was not error. She was not compelled to disclose any confidential communication passing between herself and her husband during their marriage, and within that limitation she was a competent witness. Penal Code, Â§ 715. The case of People v. Hovey, 29 Hun, 332 ; 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 180, cited by the appellantâ€™s counsel, arosd before the Penal Code took effect.
The evidence of the defendantâ€™s proposal to his fellow prisoner, Oâ€™Brien, of a plan to overcome the sheriff and escape from the jail, was competent. It. was of the same nature as proof of an attempt of a person charged with crime to flee before arrest, or to escape immediately after arrest. The circumstance that the plan involved the commission of a criminal offense other than that with which the defendant was charged in the indictment, did not render the evidence any less competent. It was equally competent with proof that the defendant when arrested in Albany attempted to escape from the officer, and with the letter written and sent by the defendant, subsequently to his conversation with Oâ€™Brien, asking that instruments be sent him to enable him to break jail and escape, both of which were received without objection. The court instructed the jury as to the legitimate effect of the evidence.
Certain letters written by the defendant to his wife, and which his wife testified she had delivered to the district attorney, at his request, without making any objection, supposing that she was obliged to deliver them, although, as she testified, she did not wish to, were offered in evidence by the prosecution and excluded. Afterwards the letters were shown to the defendant on his examination as a witness, and his attention was called to their date and to the signature, which appeared to have been â€?Franz Joseph von Petmecky, Railingbnrg.â€?He was asked why he wrote â€?von â€?and â€?Railingburg,â€?and the question being allowed against the objection of his counsel, he answered that he didnâ€™t know. Ho communication contained in the letters was proven. But if the entire letters had been read we are of the opinion no rule of evidence would have been violated. Being written by the defendant they were admissible against him. The reading of them in evidence would not have been within the prohibition of section 715 of the Penal Code, which is aimed only at a compulsory disclosure by husband or wife. Putting the letters in evidence would have involved no disclosure by the wife of the defendant, as a witness. If she had lost them, and the person finding them had put them in the hands of the district attorney, would they not have been admissible against the defendant % Even if they had been unlawfully obtained, would that have been an objection to their admissibility, they being pertinent to the issue ? 1 Greenl. Ev. % 254 a. If the entire letters were admissible there certainly was no error in permitting the defendant to be examined as to the dates and signatures alone.
The evidence of Andrew Froitzheim as to the genuineness of the defendantâ€™s signature was competent. He had seen the defendant write on one or more occasions. It is insisted by the defendantâ€™s counsel that the. fact that he and the defendant were on opposite sides of the table at the time of the writing rendered him incompetent. How far apart they were does not appear; the fact that the witness saw the defendant write is enough to carry his testimony as to the genuineness of the signature to the jury, they to give it such weight as they think it entitled to. Besides, the witness had corresponded with the defendant and received letters from him. But if the admission of the evidence was erroneous it did no harm, since the genuineness of the same signature was proved by Andrew Froitzheim, Jr., whose competency was abundantly shown.
It it contended by the appellantâ€™s counsel that the judge by defining the degrees of murder in the inverse order of their enumeration in the statute, referring finally to the first degree of the crime, and then by discussing the evidence which tended to show that the killing was done while the defendant was engaged in the commission of a felony, left * it to be inferred irresistibly that in his opinion a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree might be sustained on that ground. The learned judge carefully refrained from expressing his opinion upon any question of fact in the case. He doubtless arranged the several topics dealt with in his charge in such order as in his opinion would enable him to present them most clearly. The mere order of arrangement was a matter wholly within his discretion and is not the subject of review. We are not to presume, for the purpose of overturning the verdict, that the jury so far departed from their duty, as to draw the inference suggested and allow it to influence their verdict. These remarks .are applicable also to the comment made by the appellantâ€™s counsel upon the part of the charge relating to the means of defraying the expenses of an elopement.
The point is made by the appellantâ€™s counsel that the court erred in charging that the testimony of the defendant was of no value except as corroborated by other evidence in the case. Such was not the charge. It was, in substance, that if the jury should find that the defendant had knowingly testified falsely in respect to a fact material to the case, then his testimony is entitled to credit only so far as the jury shall find it to be consistent with the established facts of the case, or corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses. In connection with this instruction, the judge adverted to the contradictory statements of the defendant as to the manner in which he became possessed of the bank-book, and as to his purpose in taking it. The authorities in this state seem to support the proposition that while the question of the credibility of a witness in general belongs to the jury, yet when they find that he has sworn corruptly false in one material thing, in the case on trial, his uncorroborated testimony is to be disregarded, and it is not error so to instruct them. Dunlop v. Patterson, 5 Cow. 243 ; People v. Evans, 40 N. Y. 1; Deering v. Metcalf, 74 N. Y. 501. When, however the witness, in testifying falsely, is not found to have done so knowingly, the question of his credibility is for the jury. Dunn v. People, 29 N. Y. 523; Pease v. Smith, 61 N. Y. 477; Wilkins v. Earle, 44 N. Y. 172; Deering v. Metcalf, supra. In the present case there was no escape from the conclusion that in one or the other of the several contradictory statements of the witness, he had testified falsely, knowingly and corruptly. There was no error in that part of the charge.
It is objected that the judge assumed that the evidence was uncontradicted that the defendant had locked the doors of the house after the homicide, whereas the defendant denied that he did so. The learned judge, in commenting upon the testimony of the defendant that he was unconscious of much that occurred at the time of the homicide, adverted to several things, which the defendant testified he did and saw on that occasion, as proper to be considered by the jury in determining whether his testimony that he was unconscious during any part of the time was credible. In that connection the judge said â€?he was unconscious, according to his testimony, of that series of acts by which he locked all the doors of the house.â€?Although the testimony on the part of the prosecution was to the effect that all the doors of the house were found locked, the defendant, on his direct examination, said nothing as to whether he locked them or not. On his cross-examination, on being asked why he locked up the house, he replied : â€?I did not lock any house;â€?and immediately afterwards, having testified that he went out at the kitchen door, on being asked if he locked it after him, he replied that he did not know. In this manner he denied having locked all the doors of the house, and the remark of the judge was therefore too broad in its assumption, but no exception was taken to it, and as it is to be presumed from the verdict that the jury found that the defendant had testified falsely and corruptly, his denial in regard to locking the doors was not entitled to credit, and the remark of the judge worked no injustice, requiring us to grant a new trial.
The judge charged, â€?If the prisoner at the bar is to be found guilty of murder in the second degree, or of any less offense, it is because you find that there is a reasonable doubt that he committed this act from a deliberate and premeditated design, and also that there is a reasonable doubt that he committed it while engaged in the commission of the crime of grand larceny in the second degree.â€?The appellantâ€™s counsel contends that this threw the onus of raising the doubt upon the defendant. We think the contention is unfounded. The charge gave the defendant the benefit of any reasonable doubt as to the grade of the crime arising upon the entire evidence. The judge had previously charged that in order to find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, they must â€?be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the act of taking this life with a deliberate and premeditated design, or that he committed it while engaged in the act or the attempt of committing the felony or taking this property from the house.â€?The case of People v. Stokes, 53 N. Y. 164, cited by the appellantâ€™s counsel, does not sustain his position. The charge there held erroneous was that the legal implication from the fact of the killing, in the absence of proof of the circumstances of its perpetration, was that the act was murder, and cast upon the prisoner the burden of showing that it was not.
Our examination of the case has satisfied us that no error was committed at the trial affecting the rights of the defendant, that the verdict is according to the evidence and the law, and that justice does not require a new trial.
The judgment and conviction should be affirmed, and the Court of Oyer and Terminer of the county of Cayuga directed to fix another day for the execution of the sentence.

1167680,PEOPLE v. ECKERT,1884-11,"Bockes, J.
defendant was charged by indictment with the crime of seducing one Sarah Osterhoudt, an unmarried female of previous chaste character, under promise of marriage. Laws of 1884, ch. 111; Penal Coke, Â§ 284. On the trial the prosecutrix testified to the material facts constituting the offense charged, and that she became enceinte because of the intercourse between herself and the defendant. The fact of the birth of the child was undisputed. Evidence was also given of opportunity and probability, such as the frequent meeting of the parties, when they would be alone together, and generally of the seeking by the defendant of private interviews, and also of the bestowal by both of personal attentions.
The defendant gave evidence in his own behalf, directly in conflict, on all material points, with that of the prosecutrix. His evidence, if credited, would establish his innocence of the offense charged. Thus his credibility became a subject of great, if not of controlling significance. On his cross-examination, and with a view to this point, he was asked the question whether he had â€?been having sexual intercourse with Emma Schoonmaker,â€â€”a person in no way connected with the case. The question was objected to by the defendantâ€™s counsel, and the objection being overruled by the court, he answered â€œYes.â€?It is urged that such ruling was erroneous. But according to the very late decision by the Court of Appeals in People v. Irving, 95 N. Y. 541; 2 N. Y. Crim. Repts. 171, it affords no just ground of complaint. See also People v. Hooghkerk, 96 N. Y. 150; 2 N. Y. Crim. Repts. 204. The question here presented was carefully and fully considered in Irvingâ€™s case in the light of the previous decisions in this state, and the evidence under the circumstances then and here existing, was held to be admissible within the discretion of the trial court. We need therefore only to refer to that case as decisive of the point here urged as ground of error.
On further cross-examination the defendant was, in substance, asked if he had not said to the father of the prosecutrix, on a certain specified occasion, that his own father had untruthfully said that he, the defendant, would rot in jail before he would marry the prosecutrix; and he denied having so said. Proof in contradiction of such denial by the defendant was offered on behalf of the prosecution, and was admitted against objection. In this, we think there was no substantial error. The evidence had a bearing upon matters in issue, in this : it bore upon the question whether the defendant had made to the prosecutrix a promise of marriage. It was, it is true, somewhat remote, but not so entirely remote and disconnected with the issue and irrelevant to the offense charged as to preclude its contradiction.
But the case is not, as we think, without serious difficulty on the proof submitted. It is certainly a very peculiar one in some of its leading features. The facts, taken as a whole, must to say the least, admit of strong suspicion as to the real existence of the imputed crime. They invite well-grounded criticism. The defendant, was at the time of the alleged seduction under promise of marriage, a mere lad, a stripling, a school-boy, but little more than sixteen years of age. The prosecutrix was nearly six years his senior, a woman of comparatively mature years, and according to the proof, of very considerable experience with men of about her own age. It can but be observed that seduction of the lad might probably be quite as readily accomplished as could be the seduction of the mature, reflecting, experienced woman. She had known the young man almost, or quite from his infancy; must have known and appreciated the fact that any proposition of marriage from him or agreement with him to marry was of questionable propriety. She was not entirely .untutored in the ways of the world, for, as she states, she had accepted the attentions of men while he was yet a â€?little bit of a boy.â€?She was certainly qualified to give him good advice against wrong-doing, and well able in her maturity to resist vicious importunity, even under circumstances of stronger temptation. 'â–?And this would be naturally expected, rather than that she should accept from one so young a proposal of marriage, and under a protestation of faithfulness to his promise, to join him in the commission of crime. Nor was the illicit intercourse confined to a single occurrence under stress of circumstances, but was deliberately permitted from time to time, even continued, as she testifies, from â€?that night and after that, up to until two months before the baby was born.â€?Is the case free from well-grounded suspicion as to the integrity of the charge ? If a seduction, it seems to have been a seduction with a continuandoâ€”a seduction singularly effected, in view of her maturity and of his immaturity; and most strangely continued. The line of conduct as testified to by her, beginning with the alleged promise of marriage, followed by continual intercourse for a considerable time, and indeed permitted long after pregnancy had ensued, seems inconsistent with any idea of the womanâ€™s seduction, holding in mind the provisions of the statute which makes seduction a punishable offence. See Penal Code, Â§ 284. The crime denounced by the law is the seduction of a female of chaste character under promise of marriage. The law contemplates infraction of purity in thought and conduct. Now in the outset we are confronted with the unusual circumstances of persons contracting marriage under an almost ludicrous disparity of age, having in mind the nature of the offense charged; the male just turning the period of pubescence, and the female a woman, as has been stated, of ma-tare years and very considerable experience in the ways of the world, with knowledge, as we must infer, of usual moral and social observances, and of what are universally regarded as the proprieties attending a matrimonial alliance.
Besides these considerations, how stands the further and other proof bearing on the alleged contract of marriage, and purity of character, both of which are necessary to the establishment of the crime charged in the indictment ? It is in proof that the prosecutrix accepted attentions from and had confidential relations with various men ; not with one or two only, but with many. She permitted them unbecoming familiarities. Beyond dispute, she was free and easy with them to an extent indicative of great laxity of moral obligation. These statements as to the proof leave out of view the testimony of the defendant, and also that of the witness,"" Chambers, who was undoubtedly effectually impeached. But it may be noted, as it was proved by several witnesses, that the plaintiff was particularly and peculiarly intimate with this man, who was shown to be lecherous and vile. The case on the reliable evidence bears hard on the probability of the alleged promise to marry, and of the purity of character of the prosecutrix. Before the defendant could be legally convicted, a case should be made' against him on all material points beyond a reasonable doubt. We are of the opinion that no fair-minded man can carefully and thoughtfully read the evidence here submitted without entertaining great doubt as to the defendantâ€™s guilt of the offense charged. We are dissatisfied with the verdict of the jury. We must conclude that they either misunderstood the provisions and requirements of the law applicable to the case, or that they gave the evidence undue force through inattention or misapprehension. We cannot in conscience permit the conviction and judgment to stand.
Conviction and judgment reversed ; new trial granted, and case remitted to the Ulster Sessions.

1167708,PEOPLE v. LYON,1884-10,"Bradley, J.
The defendant, by indictment found against him at the Erie Court of Sessions, in November, 1877, was charged with receiving, converting, &c., $2,200 owned by the city of Buffalo, with intent to defraud that city, on September 14, 1875.
This presentment was- made pursuant to chapter 19, Laws of 1875, which provides, that â€œEvery person, who with intent to defraud, shall wrongfully obtain, receive, convert, pay out or dispose of, or who with like intent by willfully paying, allowing or auditing any false or unjust claim, or in other manner or way whatever, shall aid or abet any other in wrongfully obtaining receiving, converting, paying out or disposing of any money, funds, credits, or property, held or owned by this state or held or owned officially or otherwise for or on behalf of any public or governmental interest, by any municipal or other public corporation, board, officer, agency, or agent of any city, county, town, village or civil division, subdivision, department or portion of this state, shall, on conviction of such offense, be punished by imprisonment in a state prison for a term not less than three years or more than ten years, or by a fine not exceeding five-times the loss resulting from the fraudulent act or acts, which he shall have so committed, aided or abetted, . ... or by both such imprisonment and fine.â€?He was found guilty, and by the judgment of the court sentenced to four years imprisonment in the state prison at Auburn.
He brings this appeal, and in his behalf it is contended that errors to his prejudice were committed at the trial. It appears, that in 1852 the defendant engaged in the real estate business â€”so calledâ€”in the city of Buffalo.
In 1857, Joseph Bork, as clerk, went into the service of the defendant and one Baker, who was then associated with him in the business, and in 1866 Bork became a member of the firm, then known as Lyon, Baker & Co. In 1870 they formed another partnership, having the firm name of Lyon & Co., consisting of Lyon, Bork and one Wright, for the purpose of banking business. These two firms occupied the same room, and had clerks common to both, kept separate sets of books, and occupied different desks. Early in the year 1872, Wright went out of the latter firm, and about the first of February that year, Borkâ€™s interest became one-third in both firms, which were composed of the same persons and continued so until February 1, 1874, when Baker sold out his interest to Wescott and McManus, and the name of the firm of Lyon, Baker & Go., was changed to that of Lyon, Bork & Go., and the business of both firms was carried on until the last of December, 1875, when it was quite abruptly terminated. Bork, on 6 February 1872, was elected treasurer of the city of Buffalo, qualified and entered upon the duties of the office about the fifteenth of the month. Was re-elected in Bov ember, 1874, for the term of two years from the first Monday of January following.
He entered upon this term of his office in January, 1875, and continued to act as such until he was by the mayor of the city suspended from office on December 31, 1875.
Prior, and up to about the time of the election of Bork in 1872, there had been an officer of the city, known as receiver of taxes, which office was abolished and thereafter the duties of it were vested in the treasurer of the city, and when Bork went into office in 1872, he made that business a department in his office and one Werrick cashier in that department. Bork was engaged in the business of the two firms, and soon financial relation was created and carried on to quite a large extent between the treasurerâ€™s office and the two firms in a manner which will hereafter be briefly mentioned. The jury were authorized to find and necessarily did find that on September 13, 1875, the sum of $2,200 in currency, belonging to the city, was taken from its treasury, by and to the firm of Lyon & Co. and appropriated and used by that firm in and for the purposes of its business, and was not repaid to the city. Bork on the day following (14 September) drew his check for that amount on Lyon & Go., which was never presented for payment nor paid, but was left and remained in the city treasurerâ€™s office.
The testimony tends to show that somebody went from the office of the firm after and obtained the money in question, for the firm.
It does not appear what particular person did it, but it is evident that it was done by the personal direction or authority of Pork or by him.
He says his recollection is, â€?that the $2,200, was borrowed on the 13th September at the Treasurerâ€™s office by some one from Lyon & Coâ€™s office.â€?The defendant was not then in the city and had no personal knowledge' of this transaction at that time. To charge him with the offense, evidence of transactions and circumstancesextending through the entire period, from the time Bork became city treasurer was given, which developed a remarkable history of peculation bearing directly on Bork as such treasurer, and by which was taken and diverted from the city treasury upwards of four hundred thousand dollars.
This evidence tended to show and justified the conclusion, that while the firm of Lyon, Baker & Co. and the members of it, had some property, the banking firm of Lyon & Co. was not supplied with any capital by the members, but its disbursements were dependent upon moneys received in' the course of its business from other sources, that it did considerable business, and from time to time, as necessity required, currency was taken from the city treasury and used by the firm for its purposes, some of which was repaid, but during the period of nearly four years, money so taken from the treasury, and not repaid, amounted to about $50,000 ; that the firm of Lyon, Baker & Co. and Lyon, Bork & Co. doing a real estate and insurance business, represented a large number of property owners, residents and non-residents of the city, whose interests in that respect they looked after, collected rents, paid taxes, &c., and for such disbursements for some of them, the firm did receive rents and from others of them obtained money; that when the payment of city taxes was required in each of the years 1872, 1873, 1874 and 1875, instead of paying the amount of the taxes from them into the city treasury, the firm through the aid of Bork, the treasurer, caused those taxes to be marked off the list as paid, had them receipted, charged the amounts to those persons assessed, made checks in name of Lyon, Baker & Co., and Lyon, Bork & Co. on Lyon & Co. for the amounts, which was taken by Bork and the money used in the business of the firm.
Those checks were never presented for payment, nor was the money paid into the treasury.
The taxes thus disposed of included those of the firm and its members on their property and amounted to over $60,000 in 1872, $27,000 in 1873, upwards of $117,000 in 1874, and something more than $25,000 in 1875. The facilities to obtain money for the treasury were greatly increased by the issue of bonds during those years by the city pursuant to statutes for various purposes, and a large amount of them, were, in fact, so issued. Bork, as treasurer, had charge to some extent of the negotiation of them, and did sell a large amount of those bonds in New York city aided by agencies there, and by his direction some of the proceeds, from time to time, were there placed to the credit of the firm of Lyon & Co., with the banking correspondents of the firm, and drawn out by it and used for the purposes of its business; and some of the bonds were purchased by Lyon, Baker & Co. of the comptroller of the city of Buffalo and paid for by the check of that firm on Lyon & Co., taken and retained by Bork as treasurer, and the bonds so purchased, used by the firm as security for loans of money, which moneys were used by it in its business, and the checks were never presented for payment nor paid, nor were the amounts of proceeds of bonds so credited to, and drawn out, and used by the firm, ever paid into the treasury.
The amount realized and appropriated by the firm from the proceeds of the city bonds was large and the evidence tends to show that it exceeded $100,000.
This is but a brief summary of the system used to take and divert moneys from the treasury of the city by these firms for their business purposes.
While they did not have the most approved method of keeping accounts, some of their transactions were sufficiently spread on the books and memoranda of the firm to show something of many of them, and from which, aided by other circumstances, information might be derived that their liabilities to the city of Buffalo were large. Those transactions were largely represented by four accounts appearing on the books of the firms and designated as â€?Tellerâ€™s Check Account,â€?â€?Deposit Account,â€?â€?Joseph Bork Individual Account,â€?and â€?Lyon & Coâ€™s Account,â€?which were explained on the trial as showing liabilities to the city of $384,000, and with an additional account relating to such liabilities they were increased in amount to upwards of $400,000, at the close of business in December 1875.
It is unnecessary here to refer more particularly to the system of keeping the designated accounts, than to add that the â€?Tellerâ€™s Check Account,â€?so far as related to the matters in question represented checks issued by the teller of the banking firm of Lyon & Co. to Bork on account of moneys which came to it through him, and in some instances when he had given his check to obtain the benefit of money for this firm. The proceeds of city bonds which he caused to be credited to Lyon & Co., constituted a large portion of the amount for which teller checks were so issued. The amounts would be credited to him and the tellerâ€™s check issued. Those matters in this account went into no other account on the books of the firm. These tellerâ€™s checks were kept in drawer in office of Lyon, Baker & Co. and Lyon, Bork & Co. and when their business was closed, those checks were found there, and the liability of that account appearing on the books was $98,316. There was another, sometimes called the â€?margin book account,â€?upon which entries were made daily of such cash items as went into the accounts on the books. And the firm also kept a memorandum slip upon which entries were made of moneys which did not go on to the books. Upon this slip, the evidence tends to show, that some of the amounts taken from the city treasury for temporary relief were entered, and that it contained the necessary information of the sources from which the sums there entered as received came. This slip was kept in the money drawer.
The accounts of the defendant with the firms showed him quite largely in arrears. The evidence tends to show that early in 1872 the. defendant commenced to over-draw his account with Lyon, Baker & Oo. and continued to do so ; that on the first of February 1874 his overdrafts were $25,000, on the first of February 1875 $27,000 and on the 30th of December 1875 $52,000, but this included moneys drawn for which he was responsible,in addition to his individual overdrafts ; and that not allowing him credits for profits during the four years the overdrafts would amount to $80,000; and that his overdrafts after the 17th February, 1875, including those sums drawn during that time which he was liable to pay, amounted to upwards of $25,000 ; that while the books of Lyon & Co. showed a balance due Lyon, Baker & Co., and Lyon, Bork & Co. (which were treated as one firm), the checks drawn by the latter firms on Lyon & Co. and held by Bork in the city treasury, exceeded that balance over $144,000, when the business closed in December, 1875 ; that the estimated indebtedness of the firms to the city in 1873, was $150,000, and in September, 1875, nearly $320,000, and the entire liabilities of the firms were then $460,000; that at the termination of their business in December, 1875, the entire liabilities of the two firms as appeared by their books amounted to upwards of $660,000, and that the amount of money they then had on bond was $757.26. It also appears that at times, Â» Lyon & Co. had overdrawn their accounts with their correspondents in the city of Hew York,â€”and especially was that quite largely so in the months of June, July, August and September, 1875,â€”without means of their own to take care of their account, and the proceeds of city bonds sold were to quite an extent used to rescue them from default there. And that of the $2,200 in question $2,000 was lent to Hew York on 13th September 1875 for a like purpose.
This is a general outline of the situation and transactions of the firms of which the defendant was a member, deducible from the testimony (which the jury were authorized to find), so far as may be material for consideration.
The learned counsel for the defendant, by various exceptions taken on the trial, raised the questions and insisted there, and contends here, that the evidence was insufficient to charge the defendant with the offense alleged in the indictment, and did not present any question for the jury, and that the testimony relating to the several transactions and situation of the firms, and of Bork as a member of them, not bearing directly upon the facts in relation to the $2,200 in question, was incompetent.
The charge against the defendant is, the receiving and converting the $2,200, with intent to defraud, &c., and no evidence was competent that did not bear legitimately, in some degree, on the question of his guilt or innocence of that offense.
Abstractly considered, evidence tending to show that he was or might be chargeable with any other crime than that charged in the indictment was not admissible. The alleged offense was committed, if at all, at the time the $2,200 were received and appropriated, and at no other time. The defendant was then in Utah territory, and had been for some weeks, and to make the act his, it was necessary for the people to show that it was done by his direction or pursuant to some understanding to which he was a party, and by such an understanding, combination or conspiracy as to charge him with criminal intent.
He was a member of the firm which received and applied the money to its business purposes. Some member of the firm had personal knowledge where the money came from, and had the purpose of taking and using it. The defendant did not personally know anything about that particular transaction. The prosecution had the right to give evidence tending to show that there had been an arrangement m9.de by or between him and Bork, to take from the treasury of the city, of its money, for the purposes of their firm business, from time to time, as they should require, that they had adopted that as a system for supply of currency, and it was proper to present by evidence circumstances which tended in that direction. And when sufficient appeared to justify the inference of such a combination or conspiracy between the defendant and Bork, then evidence of the transactions of the latter in aid and furtherance6 of that common purpose was competent. Having given evidence tending to prove that, from time to time, from February 1872, and quite frequently, money of the city had been taken to and used by the firms, the people were justified in the effort to show that it was done with the knowledge and consent of the defendant with a view to the establishment of a purpose on his part in common with that of Bork, to make the relation of the latter to the city treasury available as a means of supply.
This legitimately led to inquiry into the manner of keeping accounts by the firms, and somewhat of their business transactions, and financial condition. It did not appear that the defendant was at any time in the office of the city treasury during the entire period, or that he personally did any act of taking or receiving any money that came from there, but it did appear that he was in full vigor of manhood, had a large business experience and when in the city, was daily at the firmsâ€?office attending to business and looking after its interests, and it might be inferred that he had some knowledge on the subject derived from the books and memoranda of the firms and other circumstances. Then there is evidence tending to prove conversations between him and Bork which, if true, could not fail to show that he had knowledge of those transactions and the manner which supplies for the firms came from the money of the city.
These conversations were had in each of the years 1872, 1873, 1874 and 1875, one of which of 1872 was in effect an understanding that Bork, as treasurer, should hold the checks of Lyon, Baker & Co. for the amount of city taxes of the principals or clients of the firm, as well as the amount of its taxes and those of its members, so as to enable it to have the use of the money in its business, which method was adopted; that on other subsequent years as before mentioned, and in a conversation of 1873 between them, reference was made by Bork to the fact, that they then owed the city treasury $15,000, in such manner as to convey such information.
It is not necessary here to refer to the circumstances in detail which tend to establish knowledge on the part of defendant. But the testimony was such as to authorize the jury to find that the defendant was well advised of the transactions of receiving and using the money of the city by the firms in their business, and that this was so frequent and continuous during the period of nearly four years and of such magnitude as to justify the conclusion that it was adopted as a business system for the firms, with the understanding and purpose common to the defendant and Bork that it should be done and continued for financial relief of their firms when required. The methods were entirely consistent with such purpose.
The various transactions and circumstances extending through the time of the existence of these firms subsequent to February 1872 were not given upon the trial to prove that the $2,200 was taken and used in September 1875 nor in the least to bear upon that fact, which must be established or fail upon the proof relating to it alone; but were shown as bearing upon' the question of knowledge and intent. The intent of the defendant to defraud was a necessary ingredient to constitute the alleged crime.
Those facts and circumstances proved were not independent collateral transaction (such facts are not admissible), but they were associated transactions, facts and circumstances relating to knowledge and purpose, and to afford light guiding to motive and intent. Such evidence was properly received. People v. Wood, 3 Park. Cr. 681; Bielschofskey v. People, 3 Hun, 40, affirmed 60 N. Y. 616; Coleman v. People, 58 Id. 555-560; Weyman v. People, 4 Hun, 512, affirmed 62 N. Y. 623; Pierson v. People, 79 N. Y. 424, affirming 18 Hun, 239 ; Pontius v. People, 82 N. Y. 340, 347, affirming 21 Hun, 328 ; Mayer v. People, 80 N. Y. 364; People v. Shulman, 80 Id. 373 note and cases cited by Earl, J. Commonwealth v. Merriam, 14 Pick. 518-520 ; Commonwealth v. Tuckerman, 10 Gray, 173 ; Commonwealth v. Coe, 115 Mass. 501.
This comes within the exception well established, to the general rule of evidence, and necessarily so, because itiotive and intent cannot ordinarily be shown by direct testimony and resort must be had to external acts and transactions to characterize purpose.
The propositions of the counsel for the defendant are recognized as correct in the abstract, viz; that the transactions of Bork in the matters of the firm or otherwise relating to the use of the money of the city are not properly subjects for consideration as testimonyâ€”and they were not so unless they came within a common purpose of and between him and the defendant;â€”and that other acts and conduct of either Bork or defendant are not admissible for the purpose of proving that the $2,200 referred to in the indictment were received and appropriatedâ€”and this was the view taken by the court at the trial.
It was there held, and the court upon the testimony was permitted to hold that it was sufficient to justify the inference that a common purpose and combination existed between the defendant and Bork, within the scope and line of which, those transactions came, and the trial court faithfully observed the well defined limitation of the general rule which excludes evidence of collateral facts even on questions of intent (Coleman v. People, 55 N. Y. 81; People v. Dowling, 84 N. Y. 478; People v. Gibbs, 93 N. Y. 470 ; People v. Thomas, 3 Park. Cr. R. 256, 270; S. C., 3 Abb. Ct. App. Dec. 571), and kept within the exception of admissibility. But in some instances testimony tending to prove combination between the defendant and Bork was also evidence of intent, and necessarily properly so, to be effectual as to the latter, when and not until the former was sufficiently established.
And the court at the trial did not fail to recognize the principle that excluded the consideration of other conduct and transactions upon the question whether or not the act charged in the indictment was in fact committed by the defendant. Copperman v. People, 56 N. Y. 593, affirming 1 Hun, 15; Coleman v. People, 55 N. Y. 90, 91; S. C., 58 Id. 555, and cases above cited.
But by repeated instructions during the progress of the trial, the court advised the jury of the qualified purpose of testimony received, and of the proper limitation that should be applied to its effect; and this was so carefully and frequently done by the court as to guard the defendant against prejudice arising from any misunderstanding by the jury of their duty to apply such limitation in their consideration of the evidence.
The learned counsel for the defendant contends that the court should have directed a verdict for the defendant, because he was not present, and had nothing personally to do with the taking and converting the $2,200 in question.
This contention involves the inquiry, whether the crime charged in the indictment is a misdemeanor or a felony. He insists that it is the latter.
At the time the offense is charged to have been committed, and in fact when the act upon which the charge is made was committed, the defendant, as before remarked, was not in this state. And assuming that the crime charged is a misdemeanor, then it follows that the defendant was necessarily treated in the indictment as principal, for all persons in any manner engaged in commission of a misdemeanor are principals, there are in such case no accessories. Wharton Cr. Law, Â§ 131 ; People v. Clark, 4 Denio, 129,130.
The actual personal presence of the one charged at or near the place of commission of such crime, is not required to render him a principal offender, and punishable as such, whether the crime be committed through an accomplice or other agency. People v. Adams, 3 Denio, 190, 207, affirmed 1 N. Y. 173 ; People v. Hall, 57 How. 346. The absence of the defendant from the state required no more proof to establish his guilt than would have been required if he had been in the city and in the office of the firm, and had not actually participated in the particular act in question. In either case, it would depend upon his relation to the transaction arising out of the fact whether the instrumentality could be treated as his. He did not actually direct to be done this specific act, nor was it necessary that he should, to constitute his guilt, if, as the jury have found there was a common purpose existing between him and Borkâ€”a system or scheme to appropriate the city money for the purposes of the business of their firm, which may be characterized as a conspiracy,â€”then the act of one, would be the act of both, and each, while that purpose and relation continued. And having reached that conclusion, the question of intent to defraud the city, within the meaning of the law, was a less difficult one for the jury. The purposes of acts may, to some extent, be deemed characterized by their consequences. It may be assumed, at all events, that there was sufficient to justify the conclusion that the defendant knew that it was the duty of certain constituted authorities of the city to designate banks in which its moneys should be deposited by the treasurer; that the firm of Lyon & Co. was not a designated depositary of them ; and that those moneys had no business in that firm, and it had no business with them. In view of all the circumstances, some of which have before been referred to, the jury were authorized to charge the defendant with receiving the $2,200 with the intent to defraud the city of Buffalo. If, however, the offense charged is felony, the conviction cannot stand.
The indictment charges him as principal, and he could not be convicted as an accessory merely, under it. Wharton Cr. Law, Â§ 114 ; People v. Katz, 23 How. 93, and cases there cited.
To constitute a principal in a felony, the person charged must be present actually or constructively aiding in some manner in the commission of the act, or the act must be done in his absence through some agency or instrumentality, innocent in itself, which includes an innocent person employed by him for the purpose. Wixon v. People, 5 Park. Cr. 120; People v. Adams, 3 Denio, 190, 207-8; McCarney v. People, 83 N. Y. 409, 412-413.
The evidence does not bring the defendant within the rule required to make him a principal in his absence, but an accessory only, if the crime is to be treated as felony. But at common law this is not a felony. That definition was there applied to public offenses, which occasioned as their punishment, total forfeiture of lands or personal estate or both, and to which capital punishment might have been added in some degrees of guilt (4 Bl. Com. 95), which rigors have been modified and removed by statute.
The question arises whether the statute providing that â€?the term felony, when used in this act, or in any other statute, shall be construed to mean an offense for which the offender on conviction shall be liable to be punished by death or by imprisonment in a state prisonâ€?(2 R. S. 702, Â§ 30), was designed to define the crime of felony or to give a definition to the term felony, when used in a statute, with a view to the interpretation and effect of the statute in which the word did or might appear. That provision of the Revised Statutes has had some attention of the courts, and has seemingly given some conflict to their decisions upon the question. In some of the cases expressions have been used and some decisions made to the effect, that pursuant to that provision, the crimes which may be punishable by imprisonment in state prison, are felonies, although not such at common law, and are not in terms declared felonies by the statute creating them. Andrew v. Dieterich, 14 Wendell, 31-36; People v. Van Steenburgh, 1 Park. Cr. 39, 45-6; Klock v. People, 2 Park. Cr. 676, 685-6 ; People v. Borges, 6 Abb. 132, 134. And in other and later cases it is held that the definition of the crime in the respect in question is not so governed by that section of the Revised Statutes as to make all crimes felonies which may be punishable by imprisonment in state prison, when the word felony is not in the statute creating or declaring them. Fassett v. Smith, 23 N. Y. 252; Foster v. People, 50 N. Y. 604; Nichelson v. Wilson, 60 N. Y. 319 ; Thorne v. Turck, 94 N. Y. 90, 95 ; Keyser v. Harbeck, 3 Duer, 373, 386 ; People v. Adler, 3 Park. Cr. 254.
In People v. Park, (41 N. Y. 21, 24), James, J., in holding that burglary in the third degree was within the statutory definition of the term felony says, â€?this is not in conflict with Fassett v. Smith, as that related to obtaining goods by false pretences, the punishment for which was in the alternativeâ€?state prison, jail, or fineâ€”and hence not within the statutory definition of felony,â€?and he might have added that burglary at common law was a felony.
In People v. Bragle (10 Abb. N. C.) Westbbook, J. says, without much consideration, that â€?the crime charged was a felony, because under it, if convicted, he could be sent to the state prison.â€?And the court of appeals affirmed the conviction without considering the question. 88 N. Y. 585.
The cases do not furnish a very clearly defined interpretation of the section referred to. But it seems to have come from the necessity arising out of the repeal by statute of the common law definition of felony, which was done before and carried into the Revised Statutes (2 R. S. 701 Â§ 22).
Originally and at common law, the definition was that which the term imported, and"" when that was abolished, it became necessary to have a meaning applied to it, whenever it then or thereafter appeared in the statutes.
Severity will not be given to the purposes of a penal statute beyond or greater than its terms require, nor will a statute be construed to increase or multiply the cases to which the term felony may be applied, unless such construction is supported by express words or necessary implication. Commonwealth v. Barlow, 4 Mass, 439; Commonwealth v. Casey, 12 Cush. 246, 252.
That section does in terms or by fair implication declare that every offense punishable by imprisonment in a state prison is a felony, nor does it assume to define or apply the meaning of that term otherwise than in statutes where it is used. Fassett v. Smith, 23 N. Y. 257.
The common law distinction betwen a, felony and misdemeanor, to quite an extent still exists in this state. But the courts without the aid of express provision to that effect have treated it as the legislative policy or intent, that those common law felonies which do not come within the statutory definition of the term policy are misdemeanors. Shay v. People, 22 N. Y. 317; People v. Rawson, 61 Barb. 619 ; People v. Finn, 87 N. Y. 533, affirming 26 Hun, 58.
This is construction or modification in the direction of relief against the most severe consequences of felony and does not furnish any support to a construction of the section which would include within that term those offenses not felonies at common law.
These views lead to the conclusion, so far as relates to the interpretation of that section of the Revised Statutes, that those offenses known as felonies at common law, which come within the statutory definition of the term, are such still, and those which do not are not, unless made so by the use of the term in some statute, other than this section referred to ; yet there may be some exceptions established by the courts to that rule which may be treated as modifications of the common law.
The crime charged in the indictment is a misdemeanor.
The contention of the counsel for the defendant that if he intended to repay the money to the city treasury, he was relieved from the charge of intent to defraud, and entitled to a verdict of acquittal, cannot prevail. When the defendant voluntarily received and appropriated the money of the city, knowing it to be such, the law permitted the presumption of fraudulent intent and the offense was complete. His purpose to repay at some future time could not justify the act.
The support of that proposition would defeat the purposes of the statute. Commonwealth v. Tenney, 97 Mass. 50; Commonwealth v. Mason, 105 Id. 163; Commonwealth v. Coe, 115 Id. 481.
The evidence of the previous good character of the defendant put that fact into the trial, and it was like any other pertinent fact proved, entitled to consideration by the jury, and might, as stated in the request to charge, alone raise a doubt. Remsen v. People, 43 N. Y. 6. The court had charged the jury on that question and submitted to them that fact as one to be considered by them as fully as necessary (Stover v. People, 56 N. Y. 315), and was not required to adopt the language of the request and charge specifically that â€?good character may raise a doubt in the minds of the jury, when without it none â€¢would exist.â€?Moett v. People, 85 N. Y. 374, affirming 23 Hun, 60.
It is deemed unnecessary to make reference here to the other exceptions taken on the trial and state the result of the examination of them, further than to express the opinion that they were not supported by any error of the trial court.
The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed.

1167728,PEOPLE v. THOMPSON,1884-10,"Earle, J.
The indictment against the defendant was framed and the crime charged, under section 558 of the Penal Code. That section, leaving out what- is now immaterial, provides as follows: â€?A person who knowing the contents thereof, and with intent by means thereof to extort or gain any money or other property . . . sends . . . any letter or writing threatening (1) to accuse any person of a crime ... or (4) to expose or impute to any person any deformity or disgrace, is punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years.â€?And section 561, of the same chapter, provides that' â€œit is immaterial whether a threat made as specified in this chapter is of things to be done or omitted by the offender, or by any other person.â€?To make out the crime specified in section 558, it is not needful for the prosecution to show that the threat was against the person to whom the letter was sent or addressed, or that the writer or sender of the letter was the one threatening to do the wrongful act. The crime may be committed by one who sends a letter conveying a threat of some other person to do the forbidden acts, provided he sends the letter for the unlawful purpose mentioned in the act. Nor is it needful, to constitute the crime, that the threat should inspire fear, or, as claimed by the learned counsel for the defendant, that it should be calculated to produce terror. If the threat be of the kind mentioned in the statute, and be made or conveyed with the view and intent mentioned, the crime has been committed, however far the threat may have fallen short of its purpose. It would be quite foreign and immaterial for the court or jury to enter upon an inquiry as to the probable force or power of the threats. The statute defines the crime in plain language, and there is no occasion for limitations or qualifications which are not there found. The statute cannot be evaded under the guise of friendship. No precise words are needed to convey a threat. It may be done by innuendo or suggestion. To ascertain whether a letter conveys a threat, all its language, together with the circumstances under which it was written, and the relations between the parties, may be considered, and if it can be found that the purport and natural effect of the letter is to convey a threat, then the mere form of words is unimportant. Here the defendant had been concerned in the prosecution of Julian Winnnie, before the justice. The letters purported to have been written from the office of the district attorney, and he had previously said to Cornelius Winnie that he was deputy district attorney. He represents the danger of some movement to indict his son as imminent, and that he has it in his power to arrest the movement, and that the plan suggested will save him and his folks â€?some trouble and expense, as well as the stink, and show that a friend in the right place is worth something sometimes.â€?Taking the whole letter, the inference is quite strong, if not irresistible, that either he or some one else had some intention of renewing the prosecution against the son by appearing before the grand jury. Unless the letters mean that, they had no purpose whatever. It was upon that ground that the money was requested. The letters are fairly susceptible of the construction that they conveyed a threat that either he or some one else would proceed to procure an indictment against the son, and thus accuse him of crime, and expose him and his relatives to disgrace. The trial judge, therefore, did not err in submitting the letters to the jury, for them to determine their meaning and effect. It matters not that the son had been dis â€?charged upon the examination before the justice, as that discharge was no bar to a subsequent indictment and conviction for the crime charged, and certainly no bar to a subsequent accusation of the same crime. Nor does it matter, that in fact no person was proceeding or threatening to indict the son, and that all the pretenses in that respect were in fact false. It is sufficient that the letters on their face convey the threat. There was no error in receiving in evidence and submitting to the jury certain conversations had between the defendant and Cornelius Winnie prior to the sending of the letters, in which he made statements similar to those contained in the letters, and requested money to stop proceedings which he claimed were imminent to indict the son. These conversations were material and proper, as bearing upon the criminal intent of the defendant in writing the letters.
The judgment should therefore be affirmed.

1167706,PEOPLE ex rel. PERKERSOEN v. THE SISTERS OF THE ORDER OF ST. DOMINICK,1885-01,"Daniels, J.
Annie Holten, the person discharged, had been committed to the custody of the Sisters of the Order of St. Dominick by a commitment of one of the police justices of the city of New York. She was so committed for violating subdivision 1 of section 291 of the Penal Code of the State. By that section a female child, actually or apparently under the age of fourteen years, who is found begging, or receiving or soliciting alms in any manner or under any pretense, may, by subdivision 5, be arrested and brought before a court or magistrate as a vagrant, disorderly or destitute child, and the court or magistrate is authorized to commit the child to any charitable reformatory or other institution authorized by law to receive and take charge of minors. No controversy has been made as to the authority of the sisters of the order to receive the custody of the child under these provisions of the Penal Code. Neither was the commitment under which she was consigned to their custody in any manner informal or defective in carrying out these directions of the law. But still, an application was made by the petitioner for a writ of habeas corpus and certiorari to discharge the child from the custody of the sisters. These writs were each issuedâ€”the habeas corpus to the sisters themselves, and the certiorari to the police justice before whom the child had been taken and who had committed her to the custody of the order.
The habeas corpus was returned with the commitment as the authority under which the child was detained, and the police justice returned the sworn complaint, or evidence produced before him, upon which he determined the case to be within this section of the statute. Upon the hearing before the judge issuing the writ, an order was made discharging the child from custody, and it is from that order that the appeal has been taken.
The proceedings seem ""to have been instituted and the hearing afterwards had upon the supposition that the judge issuing the writs could by means of them review the hearing had before the justice, and determine whether he had, or had not, acted upon sufficient evidence in making the order resulting in the commitment of the child.
It was, in other words, designed that the judge should review the hearing, not by means of an appeal, or a certiorari, bringing it before the court for that purpose, but through a collateral application, and to consider and decide whether the justice had, or had not, erred in the conclusion adopted by him.
The proceedings authorized by the statute were not designed for this purpose. Another and an entirely different course has been prescribed to review a hearing which may have taken place in the course of legal proceedings under a statutory authority of this description. The law regulating the proceedings by habeas corpus has neither in terms nor by implication, authorized or sanctioned the consideration of the evidence submitted to the magistrate upon which he may have finally decided a case of this description to have been made out and proved. The provisions contained in the habeas corpus act furnish no authority, after a final determination has been made by the magistrate, for requiring him, in answer to a writ of certiorari, to certify and return the evidence taken before him to a judge or court proceeding under the authority of this act. What is to be done under and by virtue of the writ of habeas corpus when it may be lawfully issued has been clearly defined and prescribed, and a certiorari has only been provided for in place of the habeas corpus itself, and when that writ may not prudently be issued. Code, Â§ 2041. When the writ of certiorari is issued it is to be directed in like manner as the habeas corpus itself to the person having the custody of the individual whose discharge is the object of the application (Code, Â§Â§ 2021-2022), and the object designed to be accomplished by each writ is precisely the same; that is, to require a statement of the time and cause of the imprisonment and detention of the individual whose discharge is to be applied for. In this respect the form of each writ, as well as the directions and authority given concerning them, are the same as were, previous to the Code, contained in the Eevised Statutes of the State. 3 R. S. 6th ed. 877, Â§Â§ 41, 42.
By no provision and no construction has"" any authority been given to the judge to issue a certiorari for the purpose of bringing before himself, or before the court where the hearing is to take place, the evidence upon which a final determination may have been made by the court,, or officer, before which the proceeding has taken place. And that such a review was neither contemplated nor intended, clearly results from the directions contained in section 2032 of the Code. For that has directed that the court or judge must forthwith make a final order to remand the prisoner if it appears that he is detained in custody by virtue of a mandate issued by a court or judge of the United States having exclusive jurisdiction of the case, or second, by virtue of the final judgment or decree of a competent tribunal of civil or criminal jurisdiction, or the final order of such a tribunal made in a special proceeding instituted for any cause, except to punish him for a contempt, or by virtue of an execution or other process issued upon such judgment, decree, or final order. This direction excludes, by necessary and clear implication, the authority to inquire into the force and effect of the evidence upon which the determination may have been made. They are no more than a repetition of those previously contained in the Revised Statutes. And this construction is further sustained by those contained in section 2033 of the Code, declaring the cases in which the person may be relieved from imprisonment, neither of which includes or justifies a review of the evidence resulting in the judgment or order of the court or officer. Even the much criticised case of People v. Liscomb (60 N. 7. 559), does not permit an inquiry into the effect of the evidence to be made. For by that it was held that the court, or officer, could not go behind the judgment and inquire into errors or irregularities preceding it, to determine whether it had been properly entered or not, but was confined to the judgment and process itself in the hearing and decision which might be made.
The point whether a court, or officer, could go beyond the commitment or order set forth in its recital, to determine whether it was justified by the evidence, has been often examined in other cases, where it has been held that such a proceeding was wholly unauthorized. Stewartâ€™s case, 1 Abb. 210 ; Matter of Prime, 1 Barb. 340; Grayâ€™s case, 12 Abb. 56 ; Bennac v. People, 4 Barb. 31; Case of 12 Commitments, 19 Abb. 394; Case of Williamson, Id. 413.
The statute required no more to take place before the magistrate than appears by the commitment to have been done, for jit has simply provided that when a child shall be brought before him for a hearing he may commit it to such an institution as is maintained by the appellant. Ho other or more formal proceeding than that which took place has been provided, and by the recitals in the commitment all the requirements contained in the statute appear to have been observed.
If, however, any investigation under the habeas corpus act can be made into the sufficiency of the evidence before the magistrate, then that which was taken was sufficient to comply with the requirements of the statute. The form in which it should be taken has not been prescribed, and it has, accordingly, in an uncontested case, been left very much to the discretion of the magistrate. It was taken by him in writing, subscribed and sworn to by the witness, and established all that was required to justify the commitment which was made. It was in .the following form :
â€?State of New York, City and County of New York, ss.:
â€œJohn F. Potter, of Earlâ€™s Hotel, Canal and Centre streets, being duly sworn, deposes and says that on the fourteenth day of January, 1884, at the city of' Hew York, in the county of Hew York, one Annie Holten, a female child actually and apparently under the age of fourteen years, to wit, aged twelve years, was found begging, receiving and soliciting alms in Centre street, in violation of section 291 of the Penal Code.
â€?Wherefore deponent prays said child may be committed to some institute. John F. Potter.
â€?Sworn to before me this 30th day of January, 1884.
P. G. Duffy, Police Justice.â€?â€”And fully sustained the conclusion of the magistrate, and justified the commitment which was issued by him.
The order should be reversed, both writs dismissed, and the child re-committed to the custody of the appellant.
Davis, P. J., and Brady, J., concur.
Note. At the same time the following case was decided.
SUPREME COURTâ€”GENERAL TERM.
Davis, P. J.; Brady and Daniels, JJ.
People ex rel. Henry Eck v. The American Female Guardian Society.
Appeal from an order discharging Wilhelmina Eck from the custody of the appellant.
Daniels, J.â€”The proceedings in this case are similar to those in the case of the Sisters of the Order of St. Dominick, and what has been there said concerning their regularity and the authority of the court is equally applicable to this appeal. The commitment was that of a child of about four years of age, who was accused of frequenting the company of prostitutes and of being found with a reputed prostitute. This brought the case within subdivision 4 of section 391 of the Penal Code, and authorized the magistrate before whom the child was taken to commit her to the custody of this society. The commitment which was returned showed a full compliance with the provisions of the statute, and completely answered the application made for the discharge of the child. The court, however, in this as in the other case, by means of a writ of certiorari directed to the magistrate, entered upon a review of the evidence produced for his consideration ; and deeming that not sufficient to warrant his determination, ordered the discharge of the child. For the reasons already assigned, this proceeding was without the sanction of the law, and the order should be reversed, the writs dismissed, and the child recommitted to the custody of the appellant.

1167707,IN THE MATTER OF JACOBS,1885-01,"Earle, J.
The relator, Jacobs, was arrested on the 14th day of May, 1884, on a warrant issued by a police justice in the city of New York under the act, ch. 272 of the Laws of 1884, passed May 12, entitled, â€?An act to improve the public health by prohibiting the manufacture of cigars and preparation of tobacco in any form in tenement houses in certain cases, and regulating the use of tenement houses' in certain cases.â€?On the evidence of the complainant he was by the justice committed for trial, and thereafter upon his petition, a justice of the Supiâ€™eme Court granted a writ of habeas corpus to which a return was made, and upon the hearing thereon the justice made an order dismissing the writ and remanding him to prison. From that order he appealed to the General Term of the Supreme Court, which reversed the order and discharged hiin from prison, on the ground that the act under which he was arrested was unconstitutional, and therefore void. The district attorney on behalf of the people then appealed to this court, and the sole question for our determination is whether the act of 1884, creating the offense for which the relator was arrested, was a constitutional exercise of legislative power.
The facts as they appeared before the police justice were as follows: The relator at the time of his arrest lived with his wife and two children in a tenement house in the city of New York, in which three other families also lived. There were four floors in the house, and seven rooms on each floor, and each floor was occupied by one family living independently of the others, and doing their cooking in one of the rooms so occupied. The relator at the time of his arrest was engaged in one of his rooms in preparing tobacco and making cigars, but there was no smell of tobacco in any part of the house except the room where he was thus engaged.
These facts showed a violation of the provisions of the act, which took effect immediately upon its passage and the material portion of which was as follows:
â€?Â§ 1. The manufacture of cigars or preparation of tobacco in any form on any floor, or in any part of any floor, in any tenement house is hereby prohibited, if such floor or any part of such floor, is by any person occupied as a home or residence for the purpose of living, sleeping, cooking, or doing any household work therein.
â€?Â§ 2. Any house, building, or portion thereof, occupied as the home or residence of more than three families living independently of one another, and doing their cooking upon the premises, is a tenement house within the meaning of this act.
â€?Â§ 3. The first floor of said tenement house on which there is a store for the sale of cigars and tobacco shall be exempt from the prohibition provided in section one of this act.
â€?Â§ 5. Every person who shall be found guilty of a violation of this act, or of having caused another to commit such violation shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished for every offense by a fine of not less than $10 and not mure than $100, or by imprisonment for not less than ten days and not more than six months, or both such fine and imprisonment.
â€?Â§ 6. This act shall apply only to cities having over 500,000 inhabitants.â€?What does this act attempt to do ? In form it makes it a crime for a cigar maker in Hew York and Brooklyn, the only cities in the State having a population exceeding 500,000, to carry on a perfectly lawful trade in his own home. Whether he owns the tenement house or has hired a room therein for the purpose of prosecuting his trade, he cannot manufacture therein his own tobacco into cigars, for his own use or for sale, and he will become a criminal for doing that which is perfectly lawful, outside of the two cities named, everywhere else, so far as we are able to learn, in the whole world. He must either abandon the trade by which he earns a livelihood for himself and family, or if able, procure a room elsewhere, or hire himself out to one who has a room upon such terms, as under the fierce competition of trade and the inexorable laws of supply and. demand, he may be able to obtain from his employer. He may choose to do his work where he can have the supervision of his family and their help, and such choice is denied him. He may choose to work for himself rather than for a taskmaster, and he is left without freedom of choice. He may desire the advantage of cheap production in consequence of his cheap rent and family help, and of this he is deprived. In the unceasing struggle for success and existence which pervades all societies of men, he may be deprived of that which will enable him to maintain his hold and to survive. He may go to a tenement house, and finding no one living, sleeping, cooking or doing any household work upon one of the floors, hire a room upon such floor to carry on his trade, and afterward some tone may commence to sleep or to do some household work upon such floor, even without his knowledge, and he at once becomes a criminal in consequence of anotherâ€™s act. He may go to a tenement house, and finding but two families living therein independently, hire a room, and afterward by subdivision of the families, or a change in their mode of life, or in some other way, a fourth family begins to live therein independently, and thus he may become a criminal without the knowledge or possibly of the means of knowledge that he was violating any law. It is therefore plain that this law interferes with the profitable and free use of his property by the owner or lessee of a tenement house who is a cigar maker, and trammels him in the application of his industry and the disposition of his labor, and thus in a strictly legitimate sense it arbitrarily deprives him of his property and of some portion of his personal liberty.
The constitutional guaranty, that no person shall be deprived of his property without due process of law, may be violated without the physical taking of property for public or private use. Property may be destroyed, or its value may be annihilated ; it is owned and kept for some useful purpose, and it has no value unless it can be used. Its capability for enjoyment and adaptability to some use are essential characteristics and attributes without which property cannot be conceived; and hence any law which destroys it or its value, or takes away any of its essential attributes, deprives the owner of his property. The constitutional guaranty would be of little worth if the legislature could, without compensation, destroy property of its value, deprive the owner of its use, deny him the right to live in his own house or to work at any lawful trade therein. If the legislature has the power under the constitution to prohibit the prosecution of one lawful trade in a tenement house, then it may prevent the prosecution of all trades therein.
â€?Questions of power,â€?says Chief Justice Marshall, in Brown v. State of Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, â€?do not depend upon the degree to which it may be exercised. If it may be exercised at all, it must be exercised at the will of those in whose hands it is placed.â€?Blaokstohe, in his classification of fundamental rights, says: â€?The third absolute right inherent in every Englishman is that of property, which consists in the free use, enjoyment and disposal of all his acquisitions, without any control or diminution, save only by the law of the land.â€?1 Com. 138.
In Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 177, Miller, J., says: â€?There may be such serious interruption to the common and necessary use of property as will be equivalent to a taking within the meaning of the constitution.â€?In Wynehamer v. People, 13 N. Y. 378, 398, Comstock, J., says : â€?When a law annihilates the value of property and strips it of its attributes, by which alone it is distinguished as property, the owner is deprived of it according to the plainest interpretation, and certainly within the constitutional provision intended expressly to shield personal rights from the exercise of arbitrary power.â€?In People ex rel. Manhattan Sav. Inst. v. Otis, 90 N. Y. 48, Andrews, J., says: â€?Depriving an owner of property of one of its attributes is depriving him of his property within the constitutional provision.â€?So too, one may be deprived of his liberty, and his constitutional rights thereto violated, without the actual imprisonment or restraint of his person. Liberty, in its broad sense, as understood in this country, means the right, not only of freedom from actual servitude, imprisonment, or restraint, but the right of one to use his faculties in all lawful ways, to live and work where he will, to earn his livelihood in any lawful calling, and to pursue any lawful trade or avocation. All laws, therefore, which impair or trammel these rights, which limit one in his choice of a trade or profession, or confine him to work or live in a specified locality, or exclude him from his own house, or restrain his otherwise lawful movements (except as such laws may be passed in the exercise by the legislature of the police power, which will be noticed later) are infringements upon his fundamental rights of liberty which are under constitutional protection.
In Butcherâ€™s Union Company v. Crescent City Co., 111 U. S. 746, Field, J., says â€?that among the inalienable rights as proclaimed in the declaration of independence is the right of men to pursue any lawful business or vocation in any manner not inconsistent with the equal rights of others, which may increase their property or develop their faculties, so as to give them their highest enjoyment. The common business and callings of life, the ordinary trades and pursuits which are innocent in themselves and have been followed in all communities from time immemorial, must therefore be free in this country to all alike upon the same terms. The right to pursue them without let or hindrance, except that which is applied to all persons of the same age, sex, and condition, is a distinguishing privilege of citizens of the United States, and an essential element of that freedom which they claim as their birthright.â€?In the same case Bradley, J., says: â€?I hold that the liberty of pursuitâ€”the right to follow any of the ordinary callings of lifeâ€”is one of the privileges of a citizen of the United States,â€?of which he cannot be deprived without invading his right to liberty within the meaning of the constitution.
In Live Stock, etc. Association v. Crescent City, etc. Co., 1 Abb. U. S. 398, the learned presiding justice says : â€œThere is no more sacred right of citizenship than the right to pursue unmolested a lawful employment in a lawful manner. It is nothing more nor less than the sacred right labor.â€?In Wynehamer v. People, Johnson, J., says : _ â€?That a law which should make it a crime for men either to live in, or rent, or sell their houses,â€?would violate the constitutional guaranty of personal liberty.
In Bertholf v. Oâ€™Rielly, 74 N. Y. 509, 515, Andrews, J., says, that one could â€?be deprived of his liberty in a constitutional sense without putting his person in confinement,â€?and that a manâ€™s right to liberty includes â€?the right to exercise his faculties and to follow a lawful vocation for the support of life.â€?But the claim is made that the legislature could pass this act in the exercise of the police power which every sovereign State possesses. That power is very broad and comprehensive, and is exercised to promote the health, comfort, safety, and welfare of society. Its exercise in extreme cases is frequently justified by the maxim salus populi suprema lex. It is used to regulate the use of property by enforcing the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non loedas. Under it the conduct of an individual and the use of property may be regulated so as to interfere, to some extent, with the freedom of the one and the enjoyment of the other ; and in cases of great emergency engendering overruling necessity, property may be taken or destroyed without compensation, and without what is commonly called due process of law. The limit of the power cannot be accurately defined, and the courts have not been able, or willing, definitely to circumscribe it. But the power, however broad and extensive, is not above the constitution. When it speaks its voice must be heeded. It furnishes the supreme law, the guide for the conduct of legislators, judges and private persons, and so far as it imposes restraint the police power must be exercised in subordination thereto. Judge Cooley, speaking of the regulation by the legislature under the police power of the conduct of corporations holding inviolable charters, says : â€˜â€?The limit to the exercise of the police power in these cases must be this; the regulations must have reference to the comfort, safety and welfare of society, they must not be in conflict with any of the provisions of the- charter, and they must not under pretense of regulation take from the corporation any of the essential rights and privileges which the charter confers. In short, they must be police regulations in fact and not amendments of the charter in curtailments of the corporate franchise.â€?Con. Lim. (4th ed.) 719.
In Potterâ€™s Dwarris on Stat. 458, it is said, that â€?the limit to the exercise of the police power can only be this; the legislation must have reference to the comfort, the safety or the welfare of society; it must not be in conflict with the provisions of the Constitution.â€?In Commonwealth v Alger, 7 Cush. 84, Shaw, Ch. J., says, that the police power â€?was vested in the legislature by the Constitution, to make, ordain, and establish all manner of wholesome and reasonable laws, statutes and ordinances, either with penalties or without, not repugnant to the Constitution, as they shall judge to be for the good and welfare of the Commonwealth, and of the subjects of the same. It is much easier to perceive and realize the existence and sources of the power than to mark its limitations or prescribe limits for its exercise.â€?In Austin v. Murray, 16 Pick. 121, 126, it is said: â€?The law will not allow the rights of property to be invaded under the guise of a police regulation for the promotion of health when it is manifest that such is not the object and purpose of the regulation.â€?In Watertown v. Sawyer, 109 Mass. 315, 319, Colt, J., says: â€?The law will not allow rights of property to be invaded under the guise of a police regulation for the preservation of health or protection against a threatened nuisance, and when it appears that such is not the real object and purpose of the regulation, courts will interfere to protect the rights of the citizen.â€?â€œIn the Slaughter-house cases, 16 Wall. 36, 87, Field, J., says : â€?All sorts of restrictions and burdens are imposed under the police powers, and when these are not in conflict with any constitutional prohibitions or fundamental principles they cannot be successfully assailed in a judicial tribunal..... But under the pretense of prescribing a police regulation, the State cannot be permitted to encroach upon any of the just rights of the citizen which the Constitution intended to secure against abridgment.â€?In Coe v. Schultz, 47 Barb. 64, a learned judge, speaking"" of the constitutional limitations upon the police power, says : â€?I am not willing to concede that the legislature can constitutionally declare an act or thing to be a common nuisance which palpably, according to our present experience or information, is' not and cannot be under any circumstances a common nuisance. By the common law definitions or common law decisions, I am not willing to conclude that the legislature can constitutionally declare or authorize any sanitary commission or board to declare the keeping or the use in any way of sugar or vinegar to be a common nuisance because the one is sweet and the other sour, or for any other reason. By such an unlimited power it is easy to see that any citizen might be deprived of his property without compensation, and without any color-able pretext that the public good required such deprivation.â€?See also in the Matter of Cheesebrough,78 N. Y. 232.
These citations are sufficient to show that the police power is not without limitation, and that in its exercise the Legislature must respect the great fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. If this were otherwise, the power of the Legislature would be practically without limitation. ,In the assumed exercise of the public power in â€˜the interest of the health, the welfare or the safety of the public, every right of the citizen might be invaded and every constitutional barrier swept away.
Generally it is for the Legislature to determine what laws and regulations are needed to protect the public health and secure the public comfort and safety, and while its measures are calculated, intended, convenient and appropriate to accomplish these ends, the exercise of its discretion is not subject to review by the courts! But they must have some relation to-these ends. Under the mere guise of police regulations, personal rights and private property cannot be arbitrarily invaded, and the determination of the legislature is not final or conclusive. If it passes an act ostensibly for the public health, and thereby destroys or takes away the property of a citizen, or interferes with his personal liberty, then it is for thp courts to scrutinize the act and see whether it really relates to and is convenient and appropriate to promote the public health. It matters not that the legislature may in the title11 to the act, or in the body declare that it is intended for the improvement of the public health. Such a declaration does not conclude the courts, and they must yet determine the fact declared and enforce the supreme law.
In Matter of Ryers, 72 N. Y. 1, Folger, J., speaking of the Drainage act then under consideration, says : â€œThe Legislature has done no more than the Constitution permitted in providing in general terms a way for the promotion and preservation of the public health. It is still for the judiciary to see to it that each occasion presents the necessity for the work, and that the purpose to be reached is public.â€?In Town of Lake View v. Rose Hill Co., 70 Ill. 191, the court, speaking of the police powers, says: â€œAsa general proposition, it may be stated, it is in the province of the lawmaking power to determine whether the exigencies exist calling into exercise this power. What are the subjects of its exercise is clearly a judicial question.â€?Even the power of taxation, which is one of the broadest possessed by the Legislature, is not without its limitations, and its action in reference thereto may be scrutinized by the court; and that which is done under the guise of taxation may be condemned as sheer spoliation and confiscation without due process of law. Weismer v. Village of Douglass, 64 N. Y. 91; Stuart v. Palmer, 74 Id. 183; People v. Equitable Trust Co., 96 Id. 387. The legislature may condemn or authorize the condemnation of private-property for public use, and it may in the exercise of its discretion determine-when and upon what property the power of eminent domain may be exercised; but its exercise is not beyond the reach of judicial inquiry. Whether or not a use is a public one which will justify the exercise of the power is a judicial question. It may be difficult sometimes to determine whether a use is public or private. Although the legislature may declare it to be public, that does not necessarily determine its character; it must in fact be public, and if it be not, no legislative fiat can make it so, and any owner of property attempted to be taken for a use really private, can invoke the aid of the courts to protect his property rights against invasion. Rockwell v. Nearing, 35 N. Y. 302 ; Matter of Townsend, 39 Id. 171; Matter of Deansville Cemetery Association, 66 Id. 569; Matter of Eureka Basin Warehouse & Manufacturing Co., 96 Id. 42. The general government is one of limited powers particularly specified in the Federal Constitution. But in addition to the powers granted it is provided in the Constitution that Congress shall have power â€?to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers.â€?Under this provision Congress is not the final judge of what is â€?necessary and proper,â€?but its laws must have a legitimate end in view, must be within the scope of the Constitution, must be appropriate and plainly adapted to that end, and not prohibited by, but consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, and whether the laws passed under the implied powers contained in the section cited are of the character mentioned, and thus justified, is always open to judicial inquiry. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 421; Hepburn v. Griswold, 8 Wall. 603 ; Legal Tender cases, 12 Id. 457; Legal Tender cases, 110 U. S. 421.
If it were for congress to determine when these implied or incidental powers should be exercised, its powers would be without any restraint, and instead of being a body with limited powers, it would in its own discretion have general and unlimited power of legislation. â€?Whatever meaning,â€?says Mr. Madison (1 Annals of Congress, 1848), â€?the clause of the Constitution conferring all necessary and proper means to carry into effect the enumerated powers may have, none could be admitted that would give an unlimited discretion to Congress and in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137, Marshall, Ch. J., says: â€?To what purpose are limitations committed to writing if those limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be"" restrained % The distinction between a government with limited and unlimited powers is abolished if those limits do not confine the persons on whom they are imposed.â€?These citations are apt to show how the police power may and how it ought not to be exercised, and how far its exercise is subject to judicial inquiry. A law enacted in the exercise of the police power must in fact be a police law. If it be a law for the promotion of the public health, it must be a health law, having some relation to the public health.
We will now once more recur to the law under consideration. It does not deal with tenement houses as such ; it does not regulate the number of persons who may live in any one of them, or be crowded into one room; nor does it deal with the mode of their construction for the purpose of securing the health and safety of their occupants or of the public generally. It deals mainly with the preparation of tobacco and the manufacture of cigars, and its purpose obviously was to regulate them. We must take judicial notice of the nature and qualities of tobacco. It has been in general use among civilized men for more . than two centuries. It is used in some form by a majority of the men in this state; by the good and bad, the learned and unlearned, the rich and the poor. Its manufacture into cigars is permitted without any hindrance, except for revenue purposes, in all civilized lands. It has never- been said, sd far as we can learn, and it was not affirmed even in the argument before us, that its preparation and manufacture into cigars were dangerous to the public health. We are not aware, and are not able to learn, that tobacco is even.injurious to the health of those who deal in it, or are engaged in its production or manufacture. We certainly known enough about it to be sure that its manipulation in one room can produce no harm to the health of the occupants of other rooms in the same house. It was proved in this case that the odor of the tobacco did not extend to any of the other rooms of the tenement house.
Mr. Secretary McCullough, in his late annual report to Congress, in which he recommends the removal of the internal tax from tobacco, that it might thus be placed upon a footing with other agricultural products, says: â€œAn article which is so generally used, and which adds so much to the comfort of the large numbers of our population who earn their living by manual labor, cannot properly be considered a luxury.â€?To justify this law, it would not be sufficient that the use of tobacco may be injurious to some persons, or that its manipulation may be injurious to those who are engaged in its preparation and manufacture; but it would have to be injurious to the public health. This law was not intended to"" protect the health of those engaged in cigar-making, as they are allowed to manufacture cigars everywhere except in the forbidden tenement houses.
It cannot be preceived how -the cigar-maker is to be improved in his health or his morals by forcing him from his home and his hallowed associations and beneficent influences, to ply his trade elsewhere. It was not intended to protect the health of that portion of the public not residing in the forbidden tenement houses, as cigars are allowed to be manufactured in private houses, in large factories and shops in the two crowded cities, and in all other parts of the state. What possible relation can cigar-making in any building have to the health of the general public? if or was it intended to improve or protect the health of the occupants of tenement houses. If there are but three families in the tenement house, however numerous and gregarious their members may be, the manufacture is not forbidden, and it matters not how large the number of the occupants may be if they are not divided into more than three families living and cooking independently.
If a store is kept for the sale of cigars on the first floor of one of these houses, and thus more tobacco is kept there than otherwise would be, and. the baneful influences of tobacco, if any, is thus increased, that floor, however numerous its occupants, or the occupants of the bouse, is exempt from the operation of the act.
What possible relation to the health of the occupants of a large tenement house could cigar-making in one of its remote rooms have ? If the legislature had in mind the protection of the occupants of tenement houses, why was the act confined in its operation to the two cities only ? It is plain that this is not a health law, and that it has no relation whatever to the public health. Under the guise of promoting the public health the Legislature might as well have banished cigar-making from all the cities of the State, or confined it to a single city or town, or have placed under a similar ban the trade of a baker, of a tailor, of a shoemaker, of a wood-carver, or of any other of the innocuous trades carried on by artisans in their own homes. The power ,would have been the same, and its exercise, so far as it concerns fundamental constitutional rights, could have been justified by the same arguments. Such legislation may invade one class of rights to-day, and another to-morrow, and if it can be sanctioned under the Constitution, while far removed in time we will not be far away in practical statemanship from those ages when governmental prefects supervised the building of houses, the rearing of cattle, the sowing of seed, and the reaping of grain, and governmental ordinances regulated the movements and labor of artisans, the rate of wages, the price of food, the diet and clothing of the people, and a large range of other affairs long since in all civilized lands regarded as outside of governmental functions. Such governmental interferences disturb the normal adjustments of the social fabric, and usually derange the delicate and complicated machinery of industry, and cause a score of ills while attempting the removal of one.
When a health law is challenged in the courts as unconstitutional, on the ground that it arbitrarily interferes with personal liberty and private property without due process of law, the courts must be able to see that it has at least in fact some relation to the public health, that the public health is the end actually aimed at, and that it is appropriate and adapted to that end.
This we have' not been able to see in this law, and we must therefore pronounce it unconstitutional and void. In reaching this conclusion we have not been unmindful that the power which courts possess to condemn legislative acts which are in conflict with the supreme law, should be exercised with great caution and even with reluctance. But as said by Chancellor Kent (1 Com. 450): â€?It is only by the free exercise of this power that courts of justice are enabled to repel assaults and to protect every part of the government and every member of the community from undue and destructive innovations upon their charter rights.â€?The order should be affirmed.

1167712,FADNER v. PEOPLE,1884-05,"Barker, J.
The first point made by the plaintiff in error is, that the facts set forth in the second count of the indictment, and upon which he was convicted, do not constitute the crime of forgery, nor was that offense proved by the evidence produced on the trial.
As the count in the indictment upon which the defendant was found guilty, only charges the publishing and uttering of a forged and counterfeited impression of the seal of the county clerk of the city and county of New York, that act must be declared a crime by some provision of the statute relative to forgery, or the same is not an indictable offense in this State.
By the common law it was not forgery, to make and publish, as true, a false and forged impression of a seal, but it was high treason in a subject of the realm of England to counterfeit the kingâ€™s great or privy seal. 4 Black. Com. 83, 247; 1 Colby's Crim. Law, 567.
Under our statute it constitutes forgery to make and forge an impression purporting to be the impress of a genuine seal of a public officer authorized by law to have and keep a seal. The entire provision is as follows: Section 24. â€?Every person who shall forge or counterfeit the great or privy seal of this state ; the seal of any public officer authorized by law; the seal of any court of record, including Surrogateâ€™s court, or the seal of any body corporate, duly incorporated by or under the laws of this State, or who shall falsely make, forge, or counterfeit any impression pui'porting to be the impression of any such seal, with an intent to defraud, shall, upon conviction, be adjudged guilty of forgery in the second degree.â€?2 R. S. m. p. 671.
Prior to this enactment there was no provision by statute creating and defining the offense which is mentioned therein. (See the reviserâ€™s note to this section.) It will be observed that there is no provision in this section of the statute against uttering and publishing a false impression of a seal. The act declared to be a forgery is the making of a forged and counterfeit seal, or the false making of an impression purporting to be the impression of a genuine seal.
If no other provision can be found in the statute than that contained in the 24th section, then, under the laws of this State, it is not forgery or a crime of any character, to utter and publish as true a false impression of the seal of a court of-record, and it was so conceded by the learned district attorney. It is argued in behalf of the people, in support of the conviction, that the false and forged impression of a court of record is a â€?counterfeit instrument,â€?within the meaning of the provisions contained in section 39, which declares that â€?every person who shall be convicted of having uttered and published as true, and with intent to defraud, any forged, altered or counterfeited instrument, or any counterfeit gold or silver coin, the forging, altering or counterfeiting of which is hereinbefore declared to be an offense, knowing such instrument or coin to be forged, altered or counterfeited, shall suffer the same punishment herein assigned for the forging, altering or counterfeiting the instrument or coin so uttered, except as in the next section specified.â€?Such was the construction put upon this section of the statute by the court below, and the jury were instructed that a false impression of a genuine seal purporting to be the impression of such seal, was a written instrument, within the purview of the statute.
In disposing of the case as now presented, we shall not enter upon a discussion of this question, but leave the same unsolved, and assume, for the purposes of this case, that the act of the defendant in uttering the false impression of the seal falls within the condemnation of section 39, and constitutes the crime of forgery, if the same is published in connection with and as a part of any certificate, which a county clerk, as keeper of the seal, is authorized to make in his official capacity.
To constitute the complete crime of forgery in falsely making and forging an impression purporting to be the impression of the official seal of the clerk of the court, as mentioned in the 24th section, the same must be impressed upon a paper of some kind purporting to be a legal and valid document, and also purporting to be duly authenticated. The mere forging the impression of an official seal, disconnected from a certificate made by the clerk, could not deceive any person. So, to constitute forgery, in uttering and publishing as true, a false and counterfeit impression of the seal, it is also necessary that the impression so published should be in like form and manner attached to and be a part of certification, purporting to be made by the clerk of the court. No one but the clerk, or some one of his deputies, is authorized by law to use the seal of the court. Unless the impression of the seal is made to accompany the clerkâ€™s certificate, attached to some record or document in his official custody, or placed in his hands for his certification in his official capacity, it is a misuse of the same which the law presumes every citizen knows. The statute on the subject authorizes seals to be made, kept and used by the county clerk, for these purposes and none other, and he is made the sole and only lawful custodian of the same. On the back of the paper writing, purporting to be a decree in a divorce suit, the impression was made. The inscription on the face of the true seal was â€?New York Seal.â€?On the face of the counterfeit impression, the same words appear in like juxtaposition. On the right hand of the impression are the following words: â€?Final August 14th, 1879.â€?â€?A copy.â€?â€?Hubert O. Thompson, clerk.â€?No other words or figures are written near the impression, or over it, of what purports to be the signature of the clerk. The paper or document, upon which the seal is impressed and the certificate written, purports to be a decree in a suit in which the defendant is plaintiff and Alta Fadner defendant, granted at a Special Term of this court held in and for the city and county of New York, and the same was offered in evidence in the Oneida county Court of Sessions, and the same was received by the court as proper and competent evidence, on the trial of the defendant, on an indictment charging him with the crime of bigamy. If these documents had been genuine and in due form, they would have constituted competent and material evidence in his behalf. He was acquitted on the trial by the verdict of the jury. The people on the trial of the case now here, gave evidence tending to prove that the paper purporting to be a decree was wholly false and fabricated, and that there was no record of the same in the office of the clerk of this court in and for the city and county of Hew York.
The evidence also tended to show that the impression of the seal alleged to be forged and counterfeited, was in form and similitude like the genuine seal kept and used by the county clerk, but that in fact .it was false, forged and counterfeited.
We now come to what I regard as the important question we have before us, and it is whether the making the false impression of the seal and forging of the clerkâ€™s certificate, constituted the crime of â–?forgery under the law of this state.
The rule, as now established, is this, if the instrument be invalid on its face, it cannot be the subject of a forgery. Forging any instrument or writing which, as appears on its face, would have been void, if genuine, in not an indictable offense. People v. Shall, 9 Cow. 778 ; People v. Fitch, 1 Wend. 198 ; People v. Stearns, 21 Id. 409; People v. Harrison, 8 Barb. 560 ; Cunningham v. People, 4 Hun, 455 ; 2 Bishop's Crim. law, Â§ 538 ; Warburton's Am. Crim. Law, paragraph 1438.
The English cases are to the same effect, and the rule applies as well to the statutory offense of forgery as to common law cases. If the impression of the seal had been taken from the true one and the clerkâ€™s certificate had been ungenuine, the certificate would have been incomplete and imperfect, and did not authorize the court to receive in evidence the documents to which they were attached. That paper purported to be a judgment of this court, and was offered and received in evidence in another tribunal, and could not have been legally used as evidence, without a certification in form and to the effect as provided by law. By section 933 of the Code, provision is made that copies of papers duly filed, kept and recorded in the office of one of the clerks of this county, may be read in evidence in place of the originals when properly certified by the clerk. The form and contents of such certificate, and the mode and manner of attestation, are contained in sections 957 and 958. The officer making the certificate must state therein that the paper or document has been compared by him with the original, and that it is a correct transcript therefrom and of the whole of the original, and the certificate must then be attested by the official seal of the officer.
This certificate, if genuine, is clearly defective in form and substance. The defect is fatal to the validity of the same, and it is apparent on the face of it. It ought not to have deceived any one. Because it did deceive the court below, undoubtedly through inadvertence, cannot in law make it a iorgery. It was decided in People v. Harrison (supra) that an indictment would not lie for forging a certificate of an acknowledment of a deed, when the certificate did not state that the grantor acknowledged the execution of the conveyance, the statute requiring the certificate to state that fact.
In People v. Cunningham (supra), it was said criminal forgery cannot be made out by imputing a possible or even actual ignorance of the law, to the person intended to be defrauded. If, therefore, a statute authorizes an instrument not known to the common law, and so prescribes its form as to render any other form null, forgery cannot be committed by making a false statutory one, in a form not provided by statute, even though it is so like the form prescribed as to be liable to deceive most persons. 2 Bishop, Â§ 538; People v. Harrison, supra.
In People v. Shall (supra), the indictment charged the defendant with making and forging an instrument in the following form: â€?Three months after date, I promise to pay Sebastian I. Shall, or bearer, the sum of three dollars in shoe-making, at cash price, the work to be done at his dwelling-house.â€?It was held that the forging and passing an instrument in that form did not constitute the crime of forgery, the instrument on its face,being invalid and not enforceable against its maker, as it did not express any consideration. The court remarked that the instrument, to be the subject of forgery, must purport on the face of it to be good and valid for the purpose for which it was created.
For the reason that criminal forgery was not averred in the second count in the indictment, nor proved on the trial, the conviction should be reversed and a new trial awarded. We have not inspected the evidence for the purpose of determining whether it was sufficient to warrant the conviction under the count charging the defendant with making and forging the seal, as that question was withdrawn from the consideration of the jury-
We entertain very serious doubts as to the correctness of some of the rulings receiving evidence over the defendantâ€™s objection, and if there should be a retrial upon some of the other counts of the indictment, it is not likely that the same class of evidence will be offered in the same form and for the same purpose as it was upon this, and we therefore pass over these exceptions.
At the time of the trial of and sentence, the Code of Criminal Procedure was in full force and effect, and the proper manner of bringing the case into this court for review, was by appeal and not by writ of error; but, as the district-attorney has waived the point, that the case is not properly here, we give the defendant the benefit of the errors which have been pointed out, and reverse the judgment, and grant a new trial on the indictment in the Oneida county Court of Sessions.

1167689,PEOPLE v. AUGSBURY,1884-11,"Rapallo, J.
The indictment in this case was found in June, 1881. The review of the judgment is therefore governed by the laws in force before the Code of Criminal Procedure took effect. People v. Willett, 92 N. Y 29 ; 1 N. Y. Crim. Rep. 355.
The defendant was convicted in November, 1881, in the Court of Sessions of Jefferson county, of shooting Samuel Zoller with intent to kill him. The judgment of the Court of Sessions was reversed and a new trial granted by the Supreme Court, and the people now bring their writ of error to review that judgment of reversal.
The ground upon which the Supreme Court reversed the conviction, was that the Court of Sessions erred in excluding a question put by the prisonerâ€™s counsel to one of the witnesses for the prosecution on his cross-examination. The defense interposed by the prisoner was insanity.
After he had produced witnesses to maintain that defense and had closed his testimony, the prosecution called in rebuttal Trowbridge, a physician, who had made a personal examination of the prisoner after his arrest, and he testified to the result of his examination at that time, and also gave his opinion as to symptoms exhibited by the prisoner, as described by two witnesses for the defense, and stated that those symptoms did not indicate insanity.
On cross-examination the prisonerâ€™s counsel asked Dr. Trowbridge several hypothetical questions based upon facts proved, or claim to have been proved, on the part of the prisoner, and also some theoretical questions.
These questions were not objected to as out of order, at that stage of the trial, and were allowed and answered. After this line of examination had been pursued for a considerable time and the witness had testified that the commission of a great crime, without any apparent motive, was some evidence of insanity, the prisonerâ€™s counsel asked the witness the following question:
â€?Supposing a man on a bright day in the morning in plain sight of a frequently traveled- road, goes into a field where three of his neighbors are at work, with whom he has never had any trouble, never has threatened any personal violence against them in any way, that he passes one of those parties, who says, â€?Good morning, uncle Dave,â€?and he bowed in return. He passes on to another of the neighbors, who is working with a team in the field. That he says to him, â€?Sam, I see you are at it again.â€?Sam replies, in substance, I have got the farm and got to get in my crop. Before he finishes that sentence the prisoner shoots him through the chest.â€?The question then goes on to detail the shooting of the others of the three neighbors and a second shooting of â€?Sam,â€?who is the person named in the indictment, and also a second shooting of one of the others, and concludes by asking the witness whether the case supposed would indicate insanity.
The case supposed in the question was so much at variance with the facts appearing in evidence upon the trial that it would be idle to contend that the question would have been a proper one to have been put by the defense on the direct examination of one of its own witnesses. Both by its assumptions and its suppositions the question suggested a case entirely dissimilar to the one on trial, and was a mere abstract inquiry. It was designed to depict a murderous assault, without any motive or provocation, upon three neighbors of the assailant with whom he had never had any trouble, but was on amicable terms, exchanging ordinary morning salutations and who were peaceably at work in their field; whereas, the facts in evidence were, that these three â€?neighbors â€?with whom the prisoner had never had any trouble, were Samuel Zoller and his two sons, who were claiming the right under a lease from John A. Augsbury, to work the farm on which the prisoner had long lived and which had belonged to him until he had been forced by pecuniary embarrassments to convey it to J. A. Augsbury.
That at the time of the assault in question, John A. Augsbury was endeavoring to obtain possession of the farm and had instituted summary proceedings for that purpose, the hearing of which had been adjourned to May 26, 1881, the day following the assault which was committed on May 25, 1881.
The prisoner had declared his determination that these three â€œneighbors,â€?the Zollers, should not have possession under J. A. Augsburyâ€™s lease, had warned them off and had threatened to sue them in trespass every time they came on the farm, and had actually brought an action of trespass against them for an entry on the 11th of May, 1881, and another like action for a second entry on the 12th of May, 1881, all .of which actions were pending at the time of the assault.
There is much other evidence in the case showing a bitte.r feeling on the part of the prisoner toward these three â€?neighbors â€?and none which would sustain the theory that they were on the amicable terms implied in the question, or that their presence on the farm occupied by the defendant, was regarded by him as anything but hostile.
The question put to the witness was objected to by the prosecution, two grounds of objection being specified ; one, that there was no foundation for the question in the evidence, and the other that it was re-opening the defense.
If either of the objections was sound, it was a sufficient answer to the claim of the prisoner, as matter of legal right to put the question, and even though the court might in its discretion have allowed it, the refusal to do so, was not error.
The objection that there was no foundation for the question in the evidence was, in our judgment, sufficient to authorize the court to exclude it. Hypothetical questions are allowed to be put to experts, but the hypothesis upon which they are examined must be based upon facts admitted or established by the evidence, or which, if controverted, the jury might legitimately find, on weighing the evidence. Purely imaginary or abstract questions, assuming facts or theories for which there is no foundation in the evidence, are not admissible as matter of right. On cross-examination such abstract or theoretical questions, not founded upon the facts of the case on trial, may be put for the purpose of testing the knowledge and information of the witness as to the subject upon which he has been examined, and his competency to give the opinion which he may have pronounced on his direct examination. But the allowance of such questions, like other collateral inquiries touching only the credibility of the witness, rests in the discretion of the court, and when the discretion is fairly exercised, it is not error to exclude them. Dilleber v. Home Life Ins. Co., 87 N. Y. 79-88; La Bean v. People, 34 Id. 223. Were the rule otherwise, there would be no limit to the cross-examination of a witness called as an expert. It could be protracted as long as the fertility of the imagination of the examining counsel might enable him to suppose cases, and the mental and physical powers of endurance of the witness would permit him to frame answers.
In our judgment the exclusion of the question put to Dr. Trowbridge was a fair exercise of the discretion of the court, and therefore not error, and did not justify the Supreme Court in reversing the conviction. We have examined the other-exceptions contained in the case and find nothing in them warranting the reversal.
The judgment of the Supreme Court should therefore be reversed and that of the Court of Sessions of Jefferson county affirmed.

1167723,PEOPLE v. CONROY,1884-10,"Ruger, Ch. J.
The defendant was indicted and convicted in the Court of General Sessions of Mew York of the crime of murder in the first degree, for having killed one Peter Keenan on the night of November 3, 1883, by means of a pistol. The killing was not denied, but it was urged in defense that there was an absence of that deliberation and premeditation essential to the commission of the crime charged, and that the defendant was insane at the time of its perpetration. The General Term reversed the conviction upon the ground that the evidence was insufficient to establish such deliberation and premeditation, and that such evidence was essential to justify a conviction under the indictment.
Although we differ with that court in reference to both the propositions stated, we are precluded from reversing its order upon that ground by a well founded exception taken by the defendant to the decision of the trial court, excluding certain evidence offered by him, and which requires us to affirm the order granting a new trial.
One of the defenses sought to be established upon the trial was the insanity of the defendant at the time of the commission of the offense. The witness Buckley had testified to the conduct and conversation of the defendant at an interview occur ring between them earlier in the evening of the day on which the homicide occurred, and stated that he then drank two glasses of sherry with Conroy, and conversed with him for the space of one hour. He testified to the details of a long conversation in which the defendant appeared to talk in a rambling, incoherent and discursive manner. He was afterwards asked by the defendantâ€™s counsel the question: â€œWere his acts at 8 oâ€™clock that night in your judgment rational or irrational ?â€?This question was objected to by the counsel for the people, and the objection was sustained by the court, to which the defendant excepted.
This evidence called for by this question was pertinent upon the issue of the defendantâ€™s insanity, and the witness was competent to give his opinion to the character of the conduct and conversation which he had observed. How much or how little the answer might have influenced the jury if the witness had been permitted to give it, we are unable to conjecture. The jurors might have considered it important, or in the exercise of their judgment might have disregarded it as of no material weight. The question of defendantâ€™s sanity was one upon which the jury was required to pass, and the defendant was entitled to give such competent evidence as he possessed upon that question, and this privilege was denied him.
The rule iegulating the admissibility of the opinions of non-expert witnesses upon questions affecting the mental condition of individuals, is well stated in the opinion of Judge Porter in Clapp v. Fullerton, 34 N. Y. 190. He says: â€?When a layman is examined as to facts within his own knowledge and observation, tending to show the soundness or unsoundness of the testatorâ€™s mind, he may characterize as rational or irrational the acts and declarations to which he testified.â€?â€?But to render his opinion admissible, even to this extent, it must be limited to his conclusions from the specific facts he discloses.â€?The rule thus expressed was followed and approved in the cases of Oâ€™Brien v. People, 36 N. Y 282, and Hewlett v. Wood, 55 N. Y 634.
This question was recently examined and discussed in this court in the case of Holcomb v. Holcomb, 95 N, Y. 316, and the rule, as above stated, was approved, and our conclusion upon this question leads to an affirmance of the General Term order. A r.ew trial, therefore, being necessary, its exigencies require us to examine the conclusions reached by the General Term in ordering it, and to state our reasons for differing with the views expressed in the prevailing opinion of that court, upon which such order was based.
The Penal Code (Â§ 183) declares that, â€?the killing of a human being, unless it is excusable or justifiable, is murder in the first degree, when committed either from a deliberate or premeditated design to effect the death of the person killed, or of another, or by an act immediately dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind regardless of human life, although without a premeditated design to effect the death of any individual.â€?Other cases, not important here to refer to, are also described in the statute.
This indictment contained two counts, one alleging, substantially, that the defendant shot off and discharged a pistol at Peter Keenan, resulting in his death, â€?with a deliberate and premeditated design to â€?effect his death. The second count charged, in substance, that the defendant committed the crime of murder in the first degree, in the First Ward of the city and county of New York, on November 3, 1882, by feloniously, willfully, and with malice aforethought, shooting one Peter Keenan with a bullet discharged by him from a pistol, and thereby inflicting upon said Keenan a mortal wound, whereof he died on November 4,1883; that said billing was done willfully, feloniously, and of his malice aforethought and contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided.â€?This count seems to contain all of the allegations necessary to describe the crime of murder in the first degree, as defined in the Penal Code. The requisities of a good indictment, are prescribed by section 275 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and are the following: â€?The indictment must contain : 1st. The title of the action, specifying the name of the court to which the indictment is presented, and the names of the parties. 2d. A plain and concise statement of the act constituting the crime, without unnecessary repetition.
Section 284 provides with reference to objections, which may be made to an indictment for defects in the description of the offense, that it is sufficient, if it can be understood therefrom : â€?6th. That the act or omission charged as the crime is plainly and concisely set forth. 7th. That the act or omission charged as the crime, is stated with such a degree of certainty as to enable the court to pronounce judgment upon a conviction according to the right of the case.â€?The act through which the crime in this case was effected is fully described in the second count of the indictment, and is charged to have constituted the crime of murder in the first degree, and to have been done feloniously, with malice aforethought, and contrary to the form of the statute in such cases made and provided.
It has never been required under the strictest and most technical rules of pleading that the particular intent with which a homicide was committed should be set forth in the indictment; but it has uniformly been deemed sufficient to allege it to have been done feloniously, with malice aforethought, and contrary to the form of the statute. People v. Enoch, 13 Wend. 159; People v. Kennedy, 32 N. Y. 145; People v. Fitzgerrold, 37 N. Y. 413.
The question as to whether the crime was committed under such circumstances, with reference to intent, as makes it murder in the first degree, within the statutory definition, has been held, under several changes of the statute, defining that crime to be one of evidence determinable by the jury under the instructions of the court. People v. Enoch, supra. Judge Woodruff, in Fitzgerrold v. People, supra, commenting upon the case of People v. Enoch and others, says: â€?The result of these cases most clearly is, that the crime of murder is sufficiently charged when alleged as in the present indictment, â€?with malice aforethought.â€?But in order to prove the crime, the proof must establish a case within the requirement of the statute in one of its three subdivisions, and the party indicted is entitled to proper instructions to the jury as to what facts must be found to sustain the indictment.â€?There would seem to be no reason why the form of an indictment which was considered sufficient under the strict and technical system of pleading formerly prevailing, and which required the allegation of every essential fact constituting the crime, should be deemed insufficient under a system directed to the simplification of criminal proceedings, for the avowed purpose of obviating a failure of justice, which had sometimes occurred through the technicalities of an artificial and complex mode of procedure. It was not intended by the section of the Code of Criminal Procedure abolishing existing forms of pleading in criminal actions to obliterate forms of expression or the judicial construction theretofore given to the language employed in such pleadings; but its true office was to abrogate the technical rules formerly governing the construction of criminal pleadings, and to substitute therefor the simplicity and liberality of interpretation presented by the new system of criminal procedure.
In the first report made by the commissioners of the Penal Code to the Legislature in 1850 the following form, aside from its formal parts for an indictment for murder in the first degree, was recommended, viz:
â€?A. B. is accused by the Grand Jury of the county of -by this indictment of the crime of murder in the first degree, committed as follows: The said A. B., on the-day of-, 1850, at the City of-, in this County, without the authority of law, and with malice aforethought, killed C. D. by shooting him with a pistol.â€?The commissioners say in a note to the form that â€œthe words â€?malice aforethoughtâ€?are used in the same sense in which they are understood in the existing form of indictments for murder, and are intended to comprehend the several divisions of that offense as it is defined by statute.â€?While the construction given by the commissioners of the Code is not deemed authority on the question of its interpretation, it is yet entitled to high consideration in determining the meaning and intent of the statute. An indictment which now states all of the facts necessary to constitute a crime under th Penal Code is not bad, because in the statement it adopts tl: phraseology formerly in vogue, provided, by the usual an natural import of the language, the matters intended to be alleged are communicated with sufficient clearness to fully inform the defendant of the charge which he is required to answer.
The form adopted in this case was the old common law form of pleading, which has been uniformly approved as sufficient, by the courts of this State through all the statutory changes in the definition of the crime of murder, and embraces all the allegations deemed material by the authors of the Code. It is undoubtedly the better way of pleading to charge the crime to have been committed with one of the several intents described in the Code, but we are of the opinion that it is sufficient if the description of the offense be stated in the language employed in the second count of this indictment.
Ho demurrer was interposed to this count by the defendant, and the objection that it did not conform to the requirements of sections 275 and 276 of the Code of Criminal Procedure could be taken only by demurrer. Code of Crim. Pro. Â§ 331.
It is now claimed by the people that, notwithstanding the abolition of the prior form of pleading in criminal actions effected by section 273 of the Code, that a conviction for murder in the first degree may be sustained under the second count of this indictment, if the evidence justifies it, even though it were insufficient to sustain all of the allegations charged in the first count. We fail to see how the people can be aided in this appeal by our conclusion as to the sufficiency of the second count, inasmuch as the question of fact thereby presented has not been tried and determined in the trial court.
The court on the trial substantially instructed the jury to' find a verdict of not guilty, unless they could come to the conclusion that the shooting was done with a deliberate and premeditated design to effect the death of Keenan, as charged in the first count; and that question, with the defense thereto, alone was submitted to the jury. Even if we were of the opinion, therefore, that the evidence authorized the jury to convict, under the second count of killing â€?by an act immediately dangerous to others, and evincing a depraved mind, regardless of human life, although without a premeditated design to effect the death of an individual,â€?we could not for that reason reverse the judgment of the General Term, since the questions of fact involved have not been submitted to the jury, or passed upon by the General Term. Home Insurance Co. v. Western Trans. Co., 51 N. Y. 93 ; Stapenhorst v. Wolff, 65 Id. 596.
The General Term did not reverse the conviction upon the facts, as it might have done, but a majority of that court came to the conclusion that the evidence was insufficient in law to authorize a conviction under the first count of the indictment, and reversed the judgment upon that ground.
Although we cannot agree with the views expressed by the General Term upon the question of sufficiency of the evidence of deliberation and premeditation proved against the defendant upon the trial, we would have hesitated greatly before reversing an order granting a new trial upon that ground, on account of our reluctance in a capital case to render such a decision unless it is absolutely necessary to prevent a failure of justice. The high regard which courts entertain for the rights of parties accused of crimes will always render this court reluctant to interfere with an order granting a new trial in a capital case where the necessary effect of such a cause will be to deprive a. human being of life. In such cases it is wiser and better practice on the part of the public prosecutor, unless the determination of the court below proceeds upon grounds which must necessarily be fatal to the prosecution upon a new trial, to acquiesce in the decision of the General Term, and proceed with the re-trial.
It also seems proper in this case to comment upon the form of the order appealed from, and suggest again what we consider to be the appropriate formula to be used in cases in which a review of questions of law by this court in criminal cases is desired. The present order certifies â€?that for the errors of law aforesaid, so found in the said return, and not for errors of fact, or as matter of discretion, the judgment appealed from herein, be, and the same hereby is, reversed and set aside, and a new trial of the said appellant ordered to be had.â€?In a case where questions of fact arising upon conflicting evidence are tried and determined by the jury, a defendant is entitled to a review and determination of such questions by the General Term. In this case the defendant had taken the necessary steps to secure his right and ought not to be deprived of it. Such a review has not been had, and we cannot say that the General Term would not have granted a new trial upon the evidence if it had supposed the ground of the decision actually adopted by it was erroneous. It is essential that the order made by that court should state that it had considered the case upon the facts and the result of such consideration. If it certifies that it finds no reason for granting a new trial upon the facts, and then orders a new trial upon a question of law exclusively, that question may properly be brought to this court for review. The reasons for this rule are fully explained by Judge Sapallo in the case of Harris v. Burdett, 73 N. Y. 136, and need not here be repeated or elaborated.
Recurring to the question discussed in the court belÃ³w, we are of the opinion that the jury was justified in inferring from the facts and circumstances proved, that the death of Keenan was the result of deliberation and premeditation on the part of the defendant.
The evidence tended to show that the defendant had been a policeman in the city of Hew York several months, performing the duty of a patrolman. On the night of the homicide, about half-past eleven, he passed the saloon of one Cody, in which were assembled some fifteen or more persons, and was informed that one Murphy had been treating the crowd, and that he was entitled to a drink.
He entered the saloon with some friends, and drank a small glass of sherry. He was conscious of a violation of duty in going into the saloon, and in reply to some one who interrogated him as to what he would do in case he was discovered, replied- that he should run him in. Almost immediately thereafter he commenced an abusive controversy with one Cantwell, and proposed to fight with him. He then produced some money, and offered to bet that he could whip any man in the room. Ho one accepted his offer. He invited the party to drink, and when the charge for the treat was stated to him, he angrily disputed it, and commenced polling the persons present to determine how many had drank upon his invitation. When one McGinnis stated that he had drank a glass of mixed ale, defendant called him a Gâ€”d dâ€”d liar, and upon McGinnis retorting â€?You are another,â€?knocked him down and kicked him. The crowd interposed to protect McGinnis, and gathered around the defendant, whereupon, he drew his club, and drove all except Cody, Keenan, Buckley, Keating and Cantwell from the room into a card-room adjoining. Some one else in the card-room then attempted to open the door and look into the saloon, whereupon the defendant struck at him with his club, and broke a pane of glass in the door. He then pushed the door open and struck at the people in the card-room. Immediately after this he stepped backward into the saloon three or four paces, and, putting his hand into his hip pocket, endeavored to pull out his revolver. The witness, Keating, then expostulated with him, and said, â€?For Godâ€™s sake, Billy, donâ€™t fire ; those are friends of mine.â€?He continued his efforts, but the attempt was obstructed by the instrument catching in his pocket. He soon, however, released it, and in the language of the witness, Oody, â€?turned to the left and leveled his revolver in the direction; by that I beckoned at my wife to go back when I saw the revolver pointed in the direction where she was, and Keenan and Cantwell. I spoke to her, and during the time I was speaking, the revolver was fired.â€?He fired the shot and Keenan staggered back, and he said â€?I am gone.â€?Cantwell, who stook near Keenan, says, â€œI could not say whether he fired at me or Keenan, but he turned toward us.â€?The defendant, with Buckley and Keating, then went into the street, and, seeing two or three boys running away from the vicinity, threw his club and discharged three or four shots from his revolver at them. Reinforced by two policemen, to whom he stated that he had been fighting a mob, he returned to the saloon, where he was informed that a man had been shot. He there saw two men and inquired, â€?Ainâ€™t those two of the mob Being answered by Buckley that he had seen no mob that night, he said, â€?I have been hit with bricks, havenâ€™t I ?â€?Buckley replied, â€œHo.â€?The defendant then gave the two men into the custody of his associates, and finding Keenan lying behind the bar, pulled him up by the lappel of his coat and compelled him to walk to the station-house. The evidence tended to show that he clubbed Keenan severely on the way, and inflicted bruises on his face, head and neck. On arriving at the station-house, Conroy stated to the police in charge that he was assaulted by a crowd of roughs in Thirty-sixth street, between First and Second avenues, while attempting to arrest Keenan for drunken and disorderly conduct. He charged that Keenan was drunk, and collected a crowd and used profane language. About the same time, in an interview with Capt. Ryan, a policeman, he stated that he arrested a man of the name of Keenan for being drunk and disorderly; â€?as I had him arrested, he assaulted me, and the crowd rushed on to me and took him away. I then drew my pistol and fired into the crowd, and I happened to shoot this man.â€?Soon after his arrival at the station, he had a conversation with Sergeant Cassidy, in which he stated that he arrested Keenan for being drunk and disorderly ; that he was attacked by a crowd and. his prisoner rescued. Upon being asked â€?Is this man shot ?â€?he replied, <Â£ Well, I donâ€™t know; if he is not, it is not my fault, I tried hard enough to shoot him.â€?It was undoubtedly essential under the first count of the indictment, that effect should be given to both of the words deliberation and premeditation as used in the statute; and that the act should have been proved to have been deliberate in the sense that it should not have been committed under the influence of sudden and uncontrollable impulse produced by a proximate cause ; and premeditated in the sense that an intention to inflict injury must have preceded the doing of the act which effected death. It is a general rule, however, that all homicide is presumed to be malicious, and, of course, amounting to murder, until the contrary appeared from circumstances of alleviation, excuse or justification. Russell on Crimes, 483 ; 2 Black. Com. 201; Rex v. Greenacre, 34 Eng. C. L. Rep. 280 ; Hillâ€™s Case, 2 Grattan, 594 ; People v. McLeod, 1 Hill, 436.
It was, however, held in People v. Stokes, 53 N. Y. 164, that a charge stating that â€?The fact of killing in this case being substantially conceded, it becomes the duty of the prisoner here to satisfy you that it was not murder, which the law would imply from the'fact of the killing, under the circumstances, in the absence of explanation that it was manslaughter in the third degree, or justifiable homicide,â€?was erroneous, because it relieved the prosecution from the burden of proving the killing to have been premeditated, and imposed the obligation upon the defendant of showing affirmatively that the homicide was effected under such circumstances as excused or justified the defendant. The effect of this decision undoubtedly requires the public prosecutor on the trial of an indictment for murder in the first degree to prove all of the essential facts required by the statute to make out the crime. But when the commission of a homicide by a person accused has been shown, it is the province of the jury to say from the facts and circumstances surrounding it, unless they clearly repel the idea of deliberation and premeditation, what the character of the act really was, and the degree of crime which should be attached to it. In other words, there is no legal presumption arising from proof of the mere commission of a homicide, which concludes the jury from finding upon that evidence alone that there was not such deliberation and premeditation as constitutes the crime of murder in the first degree, or but that the act was justifiable or excusable.
The intention to commit a homicide which is not formed under the impulse of immediate provocation, or a sudden and instinctive apprehension of danger from some apparent canse; would seem to involve, to a certain extent, both deliberation and premeditation. The terms are not the creation of our statute, but were considered essential elements of the crime at common law. It was said by Judge Johnson, in People v. Clark, 7 N. Y. 393 : â€?If there be sufficient deliberation to form a design to take life, and to put that design into execution by destroying life, there is sufficient deliberation to constitute murder, no matter whether the design is formed at the instant of striking the fatal blow, or whether it be contemplated for months. It is enough that the intention precedes the act, although that follows immediately.â€?Judge Daneoeth: says : â€œIf the killing is not the instant effect of impulse, if there is hesitation or doubt to overcome, a choice made as the result of thought, however short the struggle between the intention and the act, it is sufficient to characterize the crime as deliberate and premeditated murder.â€?Leighton v. People, 88 N. Y. 117. In People v. Majone, 91 N. Y. 211, Judge Earl says : â€?Under the statute there must be not only an intention to kill, but there must also be a deliberate and premeditated design to kill. Such design must precede the killing by some appreciable space of time. But the time need not be long. It must be sufficient for some reflection or consideration upon the matter for choice to kill or not to kill, and for the formation of a definite purpose to kill. The human mind acts with celerity which is sometimes impossible to measure, and whether a deliberate or premeditated design to kill was formed must be determined from all the circumstances of the case.â€?We think evidence was given upon the trial from which the jury was authorized to find either way upon the question of deliberation and premeditation. The circumstances of the crime showed no apparent cause for its commission, the defendant having had no previous difficulty with the deceased, and he at the time was not engaged in any act calculated to provoke the hostility or anger of the defendant.
It is suggested that the defendant had no motive for killing Keenan. To this it is sufficient to say that he had no apparent motive for killing any one, and there is no evidence tending to show that he intended to kill some other person, or that he did not intend to kill the person whom he actually killed. The existence of malice is to be inferred from the perpetration of the deed; the corrupt disregard of the person and life of another is precisely the dole or malice, the depraved wicked purpose, which the law requires and is content with. 2 Hume, 254; Starkie on Evidence, 663.
In capital as well as other cases it must be held that a person intends that which is the natural and necessary consequence of an act done by him, and unless the act was done under circumstances which preclude the existence of such an intent, the jury had the right to find from the result produced an intention to effect it.
Whenever intent is made an element in determining the character of an act, it is in accordance with our general observation and experience to infer its existence by reference to the laws which have been usually and generally found to control human conduct; indeed, this is the only method by which the intent can be made to appear.
The intent formed is the secret, silent operation of the mind, and its only visible physical manifestation is in the accomplishment of the thing determined upon. The individual whose intent is sought to be ascertained may remain silent, or, if he speaks, may, and probably will, if he has a crime to conceal, speak untruly, and thus the mind is compelled from, necessity to revert to the actual physical manifestations of the intent, exhibited by the result produced as the safest, if not the only proof of the fact to be ascertained.
This rule is always applied, unless from the circumstances of the case, it affirmatively appears that the will of the actor was subordinated to some controlling and irresistible cause precluding the existence of any voluntary mental action. In Starkie on Evidence it is said, â€œthat a rational agent must be taken to contemplate and intend the natural and immediate consequences of his own. act, is a presumption so cogent as to constitute rather a rule of law than of mere evidence,â€?p. 848. â€?There is a general presumption in criminal matters that a person intends whatever is the natural and probable consequences of his own action.â€?1 Philips Ev. p. 632. It was said by Judge Andbews that â€œIt is a fundamental rule of evidence of very general application, founded upon observation and experience, that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act,â€?in Foster v. People, 50 N. Y. 609.
The proof in this case tended to show that the defendant, knowing the location of the deceased, drew a pistol, a necessarily dangerous weapon, from his pocker with some difficulty, turned round toward Keenan and discharged it, and that the pistol ball entered a vital part and caused Keenanâ€™s death. It can hardly be conceived that the defendant was ignorant either of the presence of Keenan, the dangerous character of the weapon used by him, or the necessary effect of the discharge of a ball therefrom into the body of a human being.
It was competent for the jury to find from the circumstances that the defendant had a purpose formed, after more or less deliberation, at the time his hand moved in obedience to the suggestion of his mind to take the pistol from his pocket, and that his purpose influenced him during the time he was releasing his pistol from his pocket, and while he was conveying it from its usual receptable to the position from which it was discharged at Keenan.
It is not known that there was any-one in the direction toward which he discharged his bullet against whom he entertained animosity more than he did toward Keenan. There was therefore no controlling or probable reason for supposing that he intended to kill any other person than the one he killed. To infer the existence of deliberation and premeditation does not require the lapse of any special period of time. If a person is undisturbed by sudden and uncontrollable emotions, excited by an unexpected and observable cause, and is in the possession of his usual faculties, it will be presumed that his actions are prompted by reason and are the result of causes operating upon his mind and deemed sufficient by him to inspire his action. A sane person who, meeting a stranger upon the street, and in the absence of a sudden impulse produced by an observable cause, without words of explanation or warning, immediately draws a deadly weapon and therewith causes death, would unquestionably bring himself within the penalties prescribed for the punishment of the crime of murder in the first degree. Under such circumstances it would be impossible to conceive of a voluntary act, the commission of which requires physical exertion as being independent of mental operation and unaccompanied by a mental determination to perform such act and an incidental reflection as to the means to be employed in its accomplishment. Short as was the time occupied in the present case between the effort to get the pistol and its use, the bystander, Keating, realized the consequences and vainly attempted to avert them.
The natural laws which govern human action tend to show that when the defendant attempted to remove the pistol from his pocket he had a design to accomplish. The period daring which his effort to get the pistol was obstructed by its catching in the lining prolonged the period of his reflection, and notwithstanding the remonstrances of Keating, his design held its sway until the weapon was discharged. It required mental effort to realize that he had a pistol, to contemplate its use, and to appreciate the existence of a cause for its production at that time.
The defendantâ€™s motions apparently were not controlled by involuntary impulse produced by mental emotion or by instinctive action adopted under a sudden apprehension of danger, for no causes appear to exist accounting for such action, and the jury had the right to infer from the circumstances that they were the result of such deliberation and premeditation as brought the act within the meaning of the statute.
The evidence of intent is also corroborated by the conversation and conduct of the defendant after the commission of the crime. That evidence tends to show that the defendant immediately commenced to invent a scheme to justify his conduct, and without cause other than conscious guilt to adopt a line of conduct intended to convey false impressions as to the circumstances of the crime.
In pursuance of this scheme he made many false statements, and some that were contradictory as well as false. He quite deliberately gave two versions of the reason which induced him to shoot the deceased, in one of which he claimed that the killing was unintentional, and in the other that it was intentional. When the court below assumed to decide which of these statements was true, or that they were both false, we think it usurped the province of the jury, and gave a construction to evidence susceptible of different interpretation and which it was the exclusive right or the jury to give.
Where the inferences to be drawn from the testimony are not clear and incontrovertible, and men of ordinary judgment and discretion might differ as to its significance, it is the exclusive province of the jury to pass upon the questions involved. Thurber v. Harlem R. R. Co., 60 N. Y. 331; Morrison v. Erie Railway Co., 56 N. Y. 308.
When the consequences of his act began to be appreciated by the defendant he turned to falsehood as his defense, and, as often happens in such ca",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
