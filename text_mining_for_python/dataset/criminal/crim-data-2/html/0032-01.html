In the present case the evidence tends to show a taking of the horse to kill him, with a sole desire to injure the owner. It was incumbent on the court then, to point out to the jury the legal elements in the crime of larceny, so as to distinguish it from malicious mischief. This, we think, was not done.

The request to charge, the refusal to charge, and the exception, are all very informal and inartificial, but sufficient, we think, to present the important point in the case. The defendant was entitled to have the jury instructed in substance as requested. Mr. Wharton, in his work on <em>Criminal Law </em>(§§ 1781-4), has considered whether larceny can exist where there is no intent on the part of the taker to reap any advantage from the taking. He has reviewed the decisions, from the case of Rex <em>v. </em>Cabbage, Russ. <em>&amp; Ry. C.

He says (§ 1784), “ thus it has been frequently held to be a misdemeanor, of the nature of malicious mischief, to kill an animal belonging to another, though it has never been held larceny so to kill and take unless some benefit was expected by the taker.” And he cites in support of such statement, among other cases, Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Leach, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Mass.%2059" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Mass. 59">1 <em>Mass. </em>59</a>; People <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/cow/5/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="5 Cow. 258" data-case-ids="2032717" data-case-paths="/cow/5/0258-01">5 <em>Cow. </em>258</a> ; Loomis <em>v. </em>Edgerton, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20Wend.%20420" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="19 Wend. 420">19 <em>Wend. </em>420</a>.

There was evidence to justify the conclusion that the defendant took the horse wrongfully into his possession before the time when, as the jury might have found,.he and others killed it, and the question presented is, whether a wrongful taking, with the intent at the time to subsequently destroy the property taken, in order to injure the owner, is larceny; or whether, on the other hand, in order to constitute larceny, the wrongful taking must be with intent to benefit the person who takes. Grand larceny is the felonious taking and carrying away the personal property of another of the value of more than twenty-five dollars. 2 <em>R. S. </em>679 (§ 63). The only thing required by the definition, in the respect now under consideration, is that the taking be felonious. I cannot see why it is not as felonious to take another’s property with intent to injure him as to do the same act in order to benefit the taker. Indeed, the former is the'more malicious act of the two. The Penal Code (§ 528) has made the matter clear, by saying that the intent may be “ to deprive or defraud the true owner of his property, or of the use and benefit thereof, or to appropriate the same to the use of the taker or of any other person. ” In my opinion, such was the law before the enactment of that Code.</p>

Reg. <em>v. </em>Jones <em>(supra), </em>was a case where the prisoner, having received several letters belonging to and addressed to B., destroyed one of them, in order to suppress inquiries respecting the prisoner’s character. This was held larceny, and Pollook, J., said, <em>“ </em>will it be contended that picking a man’s pocket, not to make yourself rich, but to make him poor, would not be a larceny ?” Rex <em>v. </em>Gabbage <em>(supra), </em>was the case often cited where a prisoner was held guilty of larceny, who had taken a horse of the prosecutor and had backed it into a coal-pit and thus had killed it with no motive of personal gain, a case I may say much like the present, except that the prisoner had more excuse for his act. In Rex <em>v. </em>Wynn, 1 <em>Denison, </em>365, the prisoner, a letter-sorter in the post-office, took a letter and dropped it into the water-closet with intent to destroy it and to deprive the post-office authorities of their letter. ■ There was no personal gain to the prisoner, yet he was held guilty of .larceny.

      <em>Wharton's Criminal Law, </em>he cites, apparently to sustain a contrary doctrine, Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Leach, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Mass.%2059" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="1 Mass. 59">1 <em>Mass. </em>59</a> ; but the case decides nothing on this point. It only holds that an indictment for poisoning a cow is within the jurisdiction of a court of sessions. Ho question as to the taking of personal property was in any way involved. Mr. Wharton also expresses the opinion that American cases sustain the doctrine of <em>luori causa. </em>An examination shows this opinion to be incorrect. He cites in support of this view State <em>v. </em>Council, 1 <em>Overton </em>(Tenn.) 305. This held that stabbing a horse was indictable. It does not appear that there was any taking; so the question of larceny was not involved. He also cites Resp <em>v. </em>Teischer, 1 <em>Dallas, </em>335, a case which has nothing to do with larceny, and which only holds that the malicious killing of a horse is indictable. Ho suggestion is made in that case that the horse was ever taken from the owner, and nothing was said as to larceny.' He also cites State <em>v. </em>Hawkins, 8 <em>Porter (Ala.) </em>461, which held that taking a slave in order to set her <em>free </em>was not larceny. How the question of larceny may apply to the case of a slave, we need not discuss. It is enough to say that the doctrine for which that case is cited by Mr. Wharton is overruled, in the very state in which it was decided, in Williams <em>v. </em>State, <a href="/ala/52/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="52 Ala. 411" data-case-ids="5641929" data-case-paths="/ala/52/0411-01">52 <em>Ala. </em>411</a>, hereafter referred to; and that in that last case the court did not deem it necessary even to comment on State <em>v. </em>Hawkins. Mr. Wharton also cites McDaniel <em>v. </em>State, <a href="/miss/16/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="16 Miss. 401" data-case-ids="8840093" data-case-paths="/miss/16/0401-01">16 <em>Miss. </em>401</a>. That was an indictment for murder. In the course of the opinion a definition of larceny is incidentally given, but there was no attempt, or occasion, to define the crime accurately. The doctrine of <em>lucri causa </em>is overruled in Mississippi in the .case hereafter referred to, of Hamilton <em>v. </em>State, <a href="/miss/35/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="35 Miss. 214" data-case-ids="8837311" data-case-paths="/miss/35/0214-01">35 <em>Miss. </em>214</a>. These are the only cases that are referred to for the purpose of showing that decisions in this country sustain the doctrine of <em>lucri causa. </em>It will be seen that only one supports the doctrine, and that one has been overruled in the state where it was made.</p>

But when these circumstances exist, what does it' matter whether the motive of the person taking is to benefit himself or to injure the owner ? Suppose the property is a thing highly valued by <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>the owner, a thing which the person taking it cannot use, and does not intend to use ; and suppose that out of malice he takes it from the owner and keeps it permanently, in order to deprive the owner of it. What is this act? Hot malicious mischief; because the property is not injured. Certainly not mere trespass ; because it has the elements of malicious wrong-doing. Is such a wrong-doer to escape because he can say, “I did not take the property <em>lucri causa f” </em>Yet on the doctrine against which I am contending such a wrong-doer would escape altogether. He would be guilty of no malicious mischief, and if not guilty of larceny, would be only a trespasser; a conclusion which seems to me plainly incorrect. Undoubtedly, where there is no ■taking, there is no larceny, although there may be malicious mischief. But when the property has been in fact taken with intent to deprive the owner of it permanently it does not matter whether the thief intends to kill .and eat the cow or to kill and bury it. In a large majority of cases the thief intends personal gain. Perhaps for this reason the phrase <em>lucri causa </em>crept in to mark the distinction between larceny on the one hand, and on the other hand the wrongful taking for temporary use and to return (State <em>v. </em>Self, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Bay%20342" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="1 Bay 342">1 <em>Bay, </em>342</a>) ; or to use and leave.

But as I think the phrase was misused, or the distinction was incorrect, where it was thought that a wrongful taking with intent to destroy in order to injure the owner was not larceny. I think it incorrect to call such an act as that of the defendant, merely malicious mischief, because that is a crime which may be committed without any wrongful taking of the property. On the other hand, the taking is of the very essence of larceny. When we find that circumstance of a taking, we have only to see whether the taking was excusable or was a mere trespass or was larceny. It is of little consequence which of two bad and illegal motives influenced the wrong-doer; whether to profit himself or to injure the owner. I think there was no error in the charge in this respect.</p>
