    <p id="b79-4" data-blocks='[["BL_79.4",79,[160,526,1152,572]]]'>Under the law of this State, as it existed before the Code, and as declared in the Revised Statutes, when a person was arrested and brought before the magistrate, charged with threatening a breach of the peace, Colby says, at pages 84 and 85 of his work, that there is no examination, or trial, of the party arrested; and that he is not permitted to be heard, either personally or by counsel; he must either enter into the undertaking or be committed. But sections 87 and 88, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, have changed the law; so that the magistrate may proceed io examine the charge, and determine upon evidence, whether it is well founded, or not; and if not, may discharge the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b79-5" data-blocks='[["BL_79.5",79,[158,1112,1151,474]]]'>It may be, that the legislature intended that this court should have power, to discharge the defendant, where he is committed for want of filing the undertaking, required by section 89, the same as where the undertaking is given. But if so intended, I find it nowhere so expressed, in words ; and therefore, inasmuch as it appears, that the defendant stands committed in default of giving the undertaking, required by section 89 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, I have come to the conclusion, that this court has no power to discharge the defendant. The motion is denied.</p>
