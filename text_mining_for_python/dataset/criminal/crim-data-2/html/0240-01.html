This room, on the ground floor, opened out into the street by a door, and had two windows looking out into the said street. There was a light in the room. Henry Hicks sat within two feet of the windows, nearer to them than Celestial Jefferson, who sat about five to eight feet from him and in nearly a straight line from the window, with Hicks. Suddenly two shots in quick succession were fired from the street through the window nearest the door into the room. Henry Hicks fell from his chair shot in the head. Celestial Jefferson fell shot in the forehead and eyes. <em>1 </em>The door was immediately burst open, and the defendant rushed in and followed the women, who fled into the adjoining bedroom. Juliette Jackson escaped through a "window.

While the defendant was stabbing her, Celestial Jefferson, though wounded, escaped from the room and ran outside of the house.

Some seven or eight months previous to this, the defendant and Anna Jackson had been living in concubinage next door to her mother’s house. This illicit connection continued for several months, when the defendant went to sea for two <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>months, then returned and lived in concubinage as before for some time, aud then went to the hospital for the treatment of a venereal disease. Defendant remained in the hospital for a month or six weeks, and then returned and went to live with Hr. Doughty, a truckman, within a block or two of Mrs. Emma Jackson’s house, and insight thereof, at the date of the tragedy. After defendant returned from the hospital he began to haunt and importune Anna Jackson, his former mistress, asking her for a decided' answer. She refused hitn. The defendant then made threats—stating “ that he would get square with all hands ”—thathe would blow the whole roofs of their heads off,” referring to Celestial Jefferson, Hicks, Emma, Anna and Juliette Jackson, who were there living together as stated. One day he came to the house and struck Anna Jackson, when Celestial thrust him out, and as he was put out defendant stated he would get square with all hands. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the day of the homicide, the defendant, who had been drinking, came into Emma Jackson’s house and found Juliette Jackson there. He inquired for Anna. Juliette said, that Anna was at work, and defendant answered showing a pistol, that if she were home he would open her; that he liked her; he had asked her questions which she would not answer, she was so stubborn, and said that it would be bad for her. He said, “ You know that Blake or Walsh that stabbed a girl,” and then took up a pair of scissors and commenced fooling around Juliette’s neck, etc. He said that the ambulance would have to come up there around the hill and then he was going to Jersey. He said she need not be surprised if he came back again that night. During that call he took a pistol out of his pocket. It appeared also that the defendant had asked Anna Jackson to marry him, and had, without her acquiescence or consent, fixed the 6th of the previous May for their marriage, and that the 6th of May passed by, and that Anna had told him that it was then too late. One evening defendant met Anna in company with his brother Celestial and asked her if she was ready to give him a decided answer, and <em>“ </em>the next thing was ” he was always wanting to know who was going with, <em>“ </em>who I was going to marry, and asked for a decided answer.

He suspected Celestial to be her paramour. The defendant’s landlord, Doughty, testified that he was the owner of a double-barreled shot-gun, and that he went immediately after hearing of the shooting to the place where it was kept, and found that it had been taken from him., He identified the gun which the defendant had used in the homicide as his.</p>

The prisoner stated to Captain Folk that he never had intended to' deliver them, and that he had intended to have them found on him when he was found dead. He attempted to kill himself when captured. Upon his attention being called to the sentence : “ Alexander Jefferson, born in Hew York, May 6th, 1854,” he said: “Did I write that in only one of the letters ?” Folk replied, “ It is on one of the letters found on you.’’ Whereupon the defendant said: “Well, I suppose I did.” He also showed a letter to Maury. These letters were dated December 17, four days before the homicide, and contain statements that the defendant’s brother, Celestial, had had his (defendant’s) woman while he was-away at sea, and charged the woman with having given him the venereal disease, and contained also the sentences, “ I always said that since I knew women, the one that gave me anything, I would k. if it was ten years to come. But I did not think..it would be Ann F. Jackson. Please, for God’s sake, do- you think that a woman that is living with a man and set him.up ought to live? I cannot keep it off my mind. She gave me the --Dr. Smith said so when I went to the hospital, and the one that gave it to me was the one that I was keeping-house. I cannot help what I am go to do.” The letter-also- contains abuse and charges against his brother Celestial. The defendant stated to Captain Folk, Sergeant Gaus and Officer Guise, that he took the gun from his employer’s house, went over to the building, stepped up on the stoop and slipped off the stone on fi’ont of the door and took aim through the window at his brother ; and as he pulled the trigger the old man Hicks put his head in the way and got the charge immediately; he pulled the other trigger and shot his brother, and stood the gun down by the door and went into the house and then commenced to <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>cut. “ I didn’t know what I done and didn’t care.” Defendant also stated to witness Smith, that he had sharpened the knife for the purpose of the killing, ten days before he did it.

No ground of objection was stated by the prisoner’s counsel to the admission of the papers in evidence, and the only ground now urged in support of the objection is the want of identification of the papers offered, and the immateriality and irrelevancy to the offense charged in the indictment of certain portions of the statements contained in the writing.</p>

For several days previous to the homicide the defendant had made threats, indicating an intention to inflict personal injury upon the immates of the house where his brother and the deceased Hicks resided. While no motive can ever seem to the rational mind sufficient to induce the commission of the crime of murder, yet a motive such as that which existed in this case, viz.: a feeling of revenge against a person for having, as he supposed, supplanted him in the favor of one who had formerly occupied to him the relations of a mistress, has frequently operated as a sufficient motive to persons of ill regulated passions and ungovernable temper for the killing of a rival.</p>
