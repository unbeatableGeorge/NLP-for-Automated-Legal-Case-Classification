There he called a brother officer and requested him to fix a revolver which he had in his hand. There was then one ball cartridge in the chamber. After it was put in order, it was returned to the defendant, who inserted two more balls in the chambers. Then he returned to the front room where the deceased was sitting, and asked him why he was following him around' nights, and the deceased said, “ To make you do your duty.”. The defendant then said to him, “I will kill you dead”—and immediately discharged the pistol once. The ball passed through his brain and caused his instant death. When asked why he did it, he said he could not help it, that the deceased had been following him around, and <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>in reply to some other remark, he said, u Well, it can’t be helped now it is done.” ' This transpired in presence of two other police officers.</p>

At the close of the charge, the counsel for the defendant said : “If your Honor please, I desire formally to except to that part of the charge coming from the court to the jury in which this idea is involved : the power to distinguish between right and wrong is the sole test of responsibility. I also except to this other part of the charge of the court: If the defendant knew it was wrong to shoot, he would be guilty, even though he had insane'delusions.”</p>

They claim that there is often, found a state of mental disorder in which the will cannot act, although the preeeption be perfect; that knowledge of right and wrong may be perfect while the power to choose may be paralyzed, and that when such a state of mind has resulted from permanent disorder, its possessor is not an accountable being.
