    <p id="b76-8" data-blocks='[["BL_76.12",76,[352,1226,1149,338]]]'>The defendant, Martin, demurs to the indictment, for the reason, as alleged, that the indictment does not contain sufficient facts to constitute a crime; in that it does not set forth the name of the person whom the defendants intended to have defrauded, or assign any reason for the omission. The people have joined in the demurrer; and this court is called upon to settle the question of law thus raised.</p>
    <p id="b76-9" data-blocks='[["BL_76.13",76,[355,1568,1143,340]]]'>On the argument, the counsel for the defendant conceded, that the indictment sufficiently charges forgery in the first degree against the defendant, if subdivision 5 of section 718, of the Penal Code, is constitutional. This subdivision reads as follows: <em>“ </em>Where an intent _ to defraud constitutes a part of a crime, it is not necessary to aver or prove an intent to defraud any particular person.”</p>
    <p id="b76-10" data-blocks='[["BL_76.14",76,[353,1913,1144,192]]]'>In my judgment, the above section of the Penal Code is constitutional; and, therefore, the indictment need not allege an intent, on the part of the defendant, to defraud any particular person, but only to defraud in general.</p>

I can see no injustice to the defendant, in making his intent, by way of allegation, as general, as is his intent, in point of fact.</p>
    <p id="b77-4" data-blocks='[["BL_77.4",77,[138,584,1147,290]]]'>To be sure, the defendant is entitled to know the nature of the charge made against him : first, that he may know exactly what he is called upon to defend himself against, and to be prepared to meet, upon his trial; and second, that he maybe able to plead the indictment, when he is called upon a second time to defend himself against the same charge. .</p>
