On the kitchen floor were spots of blood and bloody tracks leading from the bed-room. On going into the bed-room he noticed three drawers of a bureaxx open and their contents stirred up. Under the bed was a hatchet, which Froitzheim had left in the woodshed that morning. It was covered with blood. In the adjoining sitting-room was the dead body of his wife, lying in a pool of blood. There were l'agged wounds upon the head, which a subsequent examination by physicians decided to be at least twenty in number, some appealing to have been made by the corner of a blunt instrument, and one by a hammer smashing down the flesh. Underneath many of the wounds the skull was fractured, and in one instance there was a complete depression of the bones on to the brain itself. The throat was discolored, showing finger prints over the carotid arteries. In the. opinion of one of the physicians there were six or eight of the wounds either of which was sufficient to produce death.

The learned judge, in commenting upon the testimony of the defendant that he was unconscious of much that occurred at the time of the homicide, adverted to several things, which the defendant testified he did and saw on that occasion, as proper to be considered by the jury in determining whether his testimony that he was unconscious during any part of the time was credible. In that connection the judge said “ he was unconscious, according to his testimony, of that series of acts by which he locked all the doors of the house.” Although the testimony on the part of the prosecution was to the effect that all the doors of the house were found locked, the defendant, on his direct examination, said nothing as to whether he locked them or not. On his cross-examination, on being asked why he locked up the house, he replied : “ I did not lock any house;” and immediately afterwards, having testified that he went out at the kitchen door, on being asked if he <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>locked it after him, he replied that he did not know. In this manner he denied having locked <em>all </em>the doors of the house, and the remark of the judge was therefore too broad in its assumption, but no exception was taken to it, and as it is to be presumed from the verdict that the jury found that the defendant had testified falsely and corruptly, his denial in regard to locking the doors was not entitled to credit, and the remark of the judge worked no injustice, requiring us to grant a new trial.</p>

Wherever you find that the prisoner has made a statement not true, to establish a falsity instead of a truth, his testimony is not entitled to the credit of a witness who stands fairly before you uncontradicted. His testimony, then, is entitled to no weight or credit of itself, except so far as it is consistent with the known and established facts of the case, or corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses. This is a consideration which you cannot avoid; it is forced upon you by the facts of the case and the importance of the issues here involved. When he testified that he had no purpose to draw any money on the bank-book, having been surprised at finding it in his possession on his way to Albany, and on his cross-examination says he took it from the bureau drawer, and that he took it with the intention to draw money with which to escape to Hew York, and when being reminded he had money enough to go to Hew York, he testifies he intended to draw money enough upon it to keep him in Hew York for a time, —one of these statements must be false, and, if intentionally false, the inference of a falsity attaches to the whole of the evidence which he has given in the case.” To this part of the charge, the defendant’s counsel excepted, and the court thereupon further instructed the jury, “ If the prisoner is shown to have deliberately falsified in his evidence, with the intent to <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>mislead and deceive the jury as to the facts of this case, the jury cannot give weight to the testimony of the prisoner, of itself—that the testimony is not entitled to credit as of itself, but is entitled to credit only so far as the jury shall find it to be consistent to the known or established facts of the case or corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses ; I say further to you that this does not brand the testimony as false ; it only declares that if he has willfully and purposely falsified in any portion of his testimony, then his testimony, of itself and alone, does not establish the truth of any thing to which he has testified.
