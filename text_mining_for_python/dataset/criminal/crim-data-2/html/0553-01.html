(See the reviser’s note to this section.) It will be observed that there is no provision in this section of the statute against uttering and publishing a false impression of a seal. The act declared to be a forgery is the making of a forged and counterfeit seal, or the false making of an impression purporting to be the impression of a genuine seal.</p>

It is argued in behalf of the people, in support of the conviction, that the false and forged impression of a court of record is a “ counterfeit instrument,” within the meaning of the provisions contained in section 39, which declares that “ every person who shall be convicted of having uttered and published as true, and with intent to defraud, any forged, altered or counterfeited instrument, or any counterfeit gold or silver coin, the forging, altering or counterfeiting of which is hereinbefore declared to be an offense, knowing such instrument or coin to be forged, altered or counterfeited, shall suffer the same punishment herein assigned for the forging, altering or counterfeiting the instrument or coin so uttered, except as in the next section specified.” Such was the construction put upon this section of the statute by the court below, and the jury were instructed that a false impression of a genuine seal purporting to be the impression of such seal, was a written instrument, within the purview of the statute.</p>

The mere forging the impression of an official seal, disconnected from a certificate made by the clerk, could not deceive any person. So, to constitute forgery, in uttering and publishing as true, a false and counterfeit impression of the seal, it is also necessary that the impression so published should be in like form and manner attached to and be a part of certification, purporting to be made by the clerk of the court. No one but the clerk, or some one of his deputies, is authorized by law to use the seal of the court. Unless the impression of the seal is made to accompany the clerk’s certificate, attached to some record or document in his official custody, or placed in his hands for his certification in his official capacity, it is a misuse of the same which the law presumes every citizen knows. The statute on the subject authorizes seals to be made, kept and used by the county clerk, for these purposes and none other, and he is made the sole and only lawful custodian of the same. On the back of the paper writing, purporting to be a decree in a divorce suit, the impression was made. The inscription on the face of the true seal was <em>“ </em>New York Seal.” On the face of the counterfeit impression, the same words appear in like juxtaposition. On the right hand of the impression are the following words: “ Final August 14th, 1879.” “ A copy.” “ Hubert O. Thompson, clerk.” No other words or figures are written near the impression, or over it, of what purports to be the signature of the clerk. The paper or document, upon which the seal is impressed and the certificate written, purports to be a decree in a suit in which the defendant is plaintiff and Alta Fadner defendant, granted at a Special Term of this court held in and for the city and county of New York, and the same was offered in evidence in <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>the Oneida county Court of Sessions, and the same was received by the court as proper and competent evidence, on the trial of the defendant, on an indictment charging him with the crime of bigamy. If these documents had been genuine and in due form, they would have constituted competent and material evidence in his behalf. He was acquitted on the trial by the verdict of the jury. The people on the trial of the case now here, gave evidence tending to prove that the paper purporting to be a decree was wholly false and fabricated, and that there was no record of the same in the office of the clerk of this court in and for the city and county of Hew York.</p>

If the impression of the seal had been taken from the true one and the clerk’s certificate had been ungenuine, the certificate would have been incomplete and imperfect, and did not authorize the court to receive in evidence the documents to which they were attached. That paper purported to be a judgment of this court, and was offered and received in evidence in another tribunal, and could not have been legally used as evidence, without a certification in form and to the <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>effect as provided by law. By section 933 of the Code, provision is made that copies of papers duly filed, kept and recorded in the office of one of the clerks of this county, may be read in evidence in place of the originals when properly certified by the clerk.
