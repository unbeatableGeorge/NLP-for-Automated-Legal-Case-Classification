In the following June, he was tried on one of these indictments, and found guilty, and sentenced to state prison for the term of five years; that being the maximum of punishment.</p>

But whether this be so or not, I do not think that it is a wise or just practice to establish, where there are several indictments, for the people to allow years to elapse, between the trials on each. They should all be tried, when the witnesses are alive and accessible; and when the testimony for both sides is readily to be had.</p>
