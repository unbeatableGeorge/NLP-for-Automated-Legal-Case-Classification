The firm at the time was insolvent, and had already obtained from the city treasury §400,000. Defendant was at the time of the conversion absent from the State, and had then no knowledge of the transaction. To charge defendant with guilty knowledge, evidence was offered that for years prior to the conversion of the specific sum alleged in the indictment, there was a conspiracy between Bork and defendant, by which money was unlawfully obtained by them from the city treasury to be used in their firm. These receipts of money appeared in their firm books, though not very clearly.

The court erred in permitting the district attorney to prove by Bork—over defendant’s objections—that in February, 1872, two years before the term of office mentioned in the indictment commenced, moneys which were received at the treasurer’s office were taken by the treasurer’s cashier, over to the office of Lyon &amp; Co., and there deposited. This transaction took place three years before the passage of the act under which defendant is indicted. It was a transaction which was entirely innocent at the time it occurred, so far as the offense charged in the indictment is concerned, and yet it is made an evidence of guilt. But it is claimed that this evidence was competent upon the question of the knowledge and intent with which Lyon received the $2,200. Admitting <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>that other offenses may be proved than those charged in the indictment for the purpose of proving knowledge and intent, then we say -that before such evidence is admissible the act of receiving the money charged in the indictment must be proved. 1 <em>Whar.

Here there was no evidence that the defendant had committed the offense charged in the indictment, except as it is derived from these other acts, and the evidence was not limited to the question of knowledge and intent, but the jury were permitted to consider it as evidence of a combination between Bork and Lyon to rob the treasury, three years and seven months after-wards, so that they could say that the act of Bork was the act of Lyon, although Lyon had no knowledge of it. Again, before the offense not charged in the indictment can be considered by the jury upon the question of knowledge or intent of the defendant in committing the offense charged against him, he must be proved to have committed such other offense. <em>Whar. Crim. Ev. </em>§ 48, b ; 1 <em>Whar. Prin. &amp; Pl. </em>§ 631; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Edgerly, <a href="/mass/92/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="10 Allen 184" data-case-ids="2117059" data-case-paths="/mass/92/0184-01">10 Allen, 184</a> ; R. <em>v. </em>Harris, <em>F. &amp; F. </em>342; People <em>v. </em>Thomas, 3 <em>Park. </em>256, 270. Ho such proof was made in this case; on the contrary, the evidence of Bork proved, if it proved anything, that the act was innocent; Lyon took no part whatever in it and had no knowledge of it until several days after it was done, when, as Bork says, he communicated it to him. We have then this condition of things: First. The jury was permitted to assume that the act proven by the people’s witness to be innocent, so far as Bork was concerned, was a wrongful act, in violation of the statute not then passed. Second. That Bork’s wrongful act thus assumed, became Lyon’s act by being communicated to him several days after it had been committed; and, Third. That Lyon’s act, though a distinct offense from that charged in the indictment, <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>was legal ana competent proof of an arrangement between Bork and Lyon, by which the act of Bork done three years and seven months after, in the absence of Lyon and without his knowledge, became the act of Lyon and made him criminal. The jury were thus permitted to base one presumption upon another, which by repeated decisions in this state, it has been held they could not legally do, as was said by the court, in People <em>v. </em>Kennedy, <a href="/ny/32/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="32 N.Y. 141" data-case-ids="16239" data-case-paths="/ny/32/0141-01">32 <em>N. Y. </em>141</a>, 145. Lyon certainly could not be charged with the effect of Bork’s act until he had notice of it, and then the money had been used. It cannot be possible that he was morally or legally bound to raise the money or take his own money and go to the treasury and replace it at the risk of becoming criminal if he did not. The admission of this evidence and its use in this action was in direct violation of the principles laid down in the authority above cited. Any illegal evidence that would have a tendency to excite the passions, arouse the prejudice, awaken the sympathies or warp or influence the judgment of the jury in the least degree cannot be considered harmless.

The court erred in permitting the district attorney to prove Bork’s conversation between him and the defendant Lyon about February 25, 1872. The conversation related to the moneys taken over to Lyon &amp; Co.’s during the first four or five days of Bork’s first term of office, mentioned in the last point,— three years and seven months before the alleged commission of the act by Lyon for which he was on trial. This conversation was before the passage of the act under which Lyon was indicted ; before Bork became treasurer, as charged in the indictment, and referred to a transaction entirely innocent in itself. Yet it is permitted by the court not only to characterize the act. committed September 14, 1875, but to show that there was a combination between Bork and Lyon to rob the treasury. Lyon is not charged in the indictment with a combination or conspiracy with Bork to rob the treasury, but with one single act of receiving $2,200 on September 14, 1875; and the second count in the indictment charges that he obtained and received it without the consent of the officers, etc., of the city of Buffalo, <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>and yet this evidence is received and from it the jury are permitted to find that the indictment is not true, but that there was a combination entered into which was carried out.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.4",514,[328,543,1165,1223]]]'>III. The court erred in permitting the witness Bork to testify to a conversation with the defendant about J une, 1872. This evidence was clearly inadmissible and incompetent for the following reasons: (A.) It was too remote, being more than three years prior to the time Lyon is charged in the indictment to have committed the offense of receiving $2,200 with intent to defraud the city. (B.) It was nearly three years before the passage of the statute under which the defendant was indicted. (C.) It was more than two years before Bork became treasurer, as charged in the indictment, and when, so far as the indictment alleges, he was simply an individual having nothing whatever to do with the city’s moneys. (D.) It appeared that this conversation was with reference to moneys which the treasurer never had in his possession, custody or control as treasurer, and moneys which never had been and which never became the city’s. How, then, could this evidence be competent upon the question of Lyon’s obtaining from the treasurer of the city of Buffalo on September 14, 1875, $2,200 of its moneys with intent to defraud the city ? The court stated the purposes for which this evidence was received, and in its charge to the jury told them they could consider this conversation as evidence not only of guilty knowledge and intent, but as evidence of a combination or agreement between Bork and Lyon, so that Bork’s act, performed in Lyon’s absence and without his knowledge became Lyon’s act and made him guilty.</p>

The court erred in permitting the district attorney to prove by the witness Bork the transactions with reference to the marking off of taxes by the city treasurer or some one in his employ, and the giving of the check by Bork on the firm of Lyon <em>&amp; </em>Co. in payment of such taxes. This evidence runs all through the case, commencing with the commencement of Bork’s first term of office and running through each year, aggregating a great many thousand dollars, and consisting of a great many transactions. It was all taken under defendant’s objection. Lyon, Baker &amp; Co. were doing a real estate and insurance bnsiuess (Bork being a member of the firm) and <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>agents for paying taxes for owners of property, residents and non-residents. Some of these tax-payers had money on deposit with or in the hands of Lyon, Baker <em>&amp; </em>Co., which they had collected for rents and received in various business transactions for such owners, and the firm of Lyon, Baker &amp; Co. looked after their property and paid their taxes. The office where the tax rolls were first delivered to the treasurer would have a clerk make out the tax bills, get the amount of taxes of each party that the firm represented for which they were agents, then these bills were taken to the office and drafts made on the parties for the amount of their taxes, notifying them that by a certain day so much money was required to pay their tax of that year. Then they money was received by the firm of Lyon, Baker &amp; Co. in answer to those drafts. When the money was received it went into the firm of Lyon, Baker &amp; Co., and was there used by them. Then, the tax bills were taken to the treasurer’s office, taxes marked paid, bills receipted and returned, and Lyon, Baker <em>&amp; </em>Co.’s check given for the amount. These checks were always drawn by Bork or some one in his employ, and were retained in the treasurer’s office. Lyon never drew one of them, never directed the drawing of one of them, was never present when one was drawn, and never had one of them in his hands, or saw one of them, so far as the evidence in this case proves. He was never in the treasurer’s office during either of Bork’s terms. The testimony of Bork shows this to be so in 1872, and his evidence is the same with reference to each of the years and each transaction. The item of $7,376.'85, taken from the treasury during the first days of Bork’s first term, by mistake, never went upon the books of Lyon &amp; Co., or Lyon, Baker &amp; Co. The moneys were never paid to Bork. When the remittances came in and the man’s tax was made good, the bills would be taken over to the treasurer’s office and the tax marked off. Ho money was brought. The clerks in the treasurer’s office marked off the taxes, Bork or some one else drew a check in the treasurer’s office to pay the taxes marked off. Bork usually gave the checks and took the tax receipts. When the men paid their taxes, they deposited the money with the firm, so that Bork, as treasurer, did not receive the money into his custody at all, and the firm of Lyon, Bork &amp; Co. <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>charged these parties commission for doing the business. Now under this condition of things Bork was permitted to testify to the marking off these taxes and the amounts marked off, from the time he first went into office in February, 1872, down to the time the firm collapsed. He says: The amount thus marked off during the first portion of his first term was $36,800; and he also says, that during the year 1872, $66,000 or more, including the 36,800, were so marked off, and in relation to this item of $36,800, he says that no check was given. The district attorney was allowed to put in evidence the checks drawn by Bork on Lyon &amp; Co., and left in the treasurer’s office representing each one of these tax transactions; when any check was given, each one of which checks were objected to by the defendant, when all the evidence there was on the subject, proved, if it proved any thing, that Lyon never wrote' them, or directed them to be written, and was never at the treasurer’s office when they were written, and never saw them, or had any knowledge of their existence. The different items of these tax matters appear at almost every point in the case and run through the whole evidence. This evidence was all inadmissible and incompetent. These moneys were not the moneys of the city ; some of them were collected by Lyon, Baker &amp; Co. for their clients, and were in their hands as agents, to be used for the purpose of paying their clients taxes; and others were paid into their hands by their clients for the purpose of paying those clients’ taxes, but they never were in the hands of the treasurer or any of the city’s officers. By the giving of the check the moneys were but transferred to the treasurer or to the city. Suppose, taking one of these cases for an example, that after one of these checks had been drawn it had been presented for payment and payment refused, could the city have claimed these moneys as theirs? It would have a remedy by suit on the check to recover the amount for which it was drawn, but that suit could only be brought against the drawer; the drawee would not be liable until accepted. The check would not operate as an assignment of the funds. Risley <em>v. </em>Phoenix Bank, <a href="/ny/83/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="83 N.Y. 318" data-case-ids="2179214" data-case-paths="/ny/83/0318-01">83 <em>N. Y. </em>318</a>. Again, suppose the city had disregarded this transaction of Bork entirely, and proceded to collect the taxes thus marked off, is <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>there any doubt but that it could have collected them ? Would it then be held that the payment of the moneys by the taxpayers to their agents, and the giving of the cheek by Bork on the firm was payment as against the city <em>% </em>We say not. If it would, then the money, the moment it was paid into the agent’s hands, became the city’s moneys, and the principals could not have withdrawn it from their agents.

The court erred in permitting the district attorney to prove the sale of bonds belonging to the city by Bork and the use of the proceeds of these bonds by the firm of Lyon &amp; Co. This evidence begins with the year 1873, and runs all through the case and includes many and large transactions making in part the $450,000 which Bork took from the public treasury during his several terms of office and converted to his own use or the use of the firm. These transactions were both before and after the time when Bork became treasurer as charged in the indictment; both before and after the passage of the act under which Lyon was indicted, and before and after the time it is alleged in the indictment that Lyon committed the offense of receiving the $2,200. This evidence was objected to. By the admission of this class of evidence the following rules of law were violated: <em>First. </em>That before evidence of guilty knowledge can be proved there must be proof of the commission of the act charged in the indictment, which was not done in this case. <em>Second. </em>That after proof has been given of the act charged in the indictment, proof must be made of the other acts by the defendant from which the jury may infer that the party had guilty knowledge or intent when he committed the act charged against him in the indictment. <em>Third. </em>That the jury cannot infer that the defendant has been guilty of one offense not charged against him, and from that inference draw <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>another inference that he had guilty knowledge or intent when he committed the offense charged in the indictment; in other words, they cannot base one inference upon another. <em>Fourth. </em>That the jury cannot find that the defendant is guilty of the offense charged in the indictment from proof that he has been guilty of another offense.</p>

The evidence showed that Lyon never came to the treasurer’s office during his terms of office, that he never took any money from there or directed any one to get any. Yet all this evidence is received and submitted to the jury, not only upon the question of knowledge and intent, but from it the jury were permitted to find that Bork and Lyon entered into this combination to rob the treasury.

The court erred in denying defendant’s motion to direct a verdict for defendant and to advise the jury to acquit the defendant, made at the close of the people’s case. First. When the people rested, the evidence as it stood failed to. show that Lyon ever had anything to do with the taking, obtaining <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>or receiving of the $2,200 charged in the indictment. Second. When the evidence was all in, it proved conclusively that for several days before, and at the time, and for several days after the money was taken from the treasury, the defendant was absent from the city, in Utah. If any crime was committed by the defendant, as charged, it was done and completed as soon as the money was used in the business of Lyon &amp; Co., on the day named. The proof showed, if it showed anything, that the $2,200 was taken from the treasury over to the office of Lyon <em>&amp; </em>Co., on September 13, 1875, and the check of Boric signed by him and drawn on Lyon <em>&amp; </em>Co., was given on September 14, 1875, the check remaining in the office of the treasurer; and the court, in its opinion denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, says: “ It is conceded that on the day this transaction occurred, Lyon was not in the city, but was in the territory of Utah, where he had been for several weeks prior to this occurrence. It was not claimed on the trial, nor is it now insisted upon by the people, that the defendant had personal knowledge of the conversion and use of this particular sum of money. It will thus be seen that the case was given to the jury upon the theory that the offense charged in the indictment was a misdemeanor, and being a misdemeanor it was not necessary that the defendant should be present in person or constructively. That his guilt might be established by such proof of combination and arrangement between him and Bork as would authorize his conviction as accessory before the fact in cases of felony. We say the court erred in so holding. The indictment charges the defendant with the commission of a felony, not as accessory, but as principal, and the proof is undisputed that he was neither actually nor constructively present, when the crime was committed, but was as far distant as Utah, and hence could not be guilty as principal as charged in the indictment. We will examine this point under the following headings : First. The defendant is charged in the indictment as principal with the commission of a felony—not a misdemeanor ; Second. Proof of actual or constructive presence when the felony was committed was indispensable to the people’s case; Third. The proof is undisputed that the defendant was <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>neither actually nor constructively present, but was in fact in Utah. If these positions are correct the judgment of conviction cannot stand. The defendant is charged in the indictment as principal with the commission of a felony—not a misdemeanor.

It is true that there are cases which at first would seem to be adverse to the defendant’s claim. But a careful analysis of those decisions and the facts on which the law was found, must lead the unprejudiced mind to the conclusion that it is finally settled, that a conviction under the act of 1875, chap. 19, is unquestionably for a felony. We are unable to find any decision of any court, except that of Judge Barker in this case, that is squarely an authority against our position, while we do find several that hold in principle exactly as we claim the law to be. One can readily distinguish from our case the cases seemingly against'us, and reconcile the principles established by them with the principles asserted as law by us. But a like attempt to distinguish and reconcile the people’s position with the cases we cite must fail. In the face of all the decisions, with no well considered case holding squarely against us, and in view of the understanding of the profession and the various text-writers, can it be reasonably held that one who takes for instance, $100,000, and- for which he may be imprisoned for ten years in the state prison, is guilty of a simple misdemeanor <em>% </em>The Revised Statutes say: “ The term felony, when used in this act, or any other statute, shall be construed to mean an offense for which the offender, on conviction, shall be liable by law to be punished by death, or by imprisonment in a state prison.” That word fel<a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>ony cannot be found in the statutes (outside of the Criminal or Penal Code), where any crime is defined or declared, except the punishment is also provided in the same statute using the word. What is the object of the above definition of a felony ? If the word felony is found in the very statute which defines the particular crime, reference to any other definition is unnecessary, provided the punishment is also named in the same statute. Where can a statute be found declaring an offense a felony without also naming the punishment ? The statute does not say that the term felony shall have a certain meaning when found in a statute defining any crime. It is as broad as could be made. It says, “ When used in this act, or in any other statute.” The word will be found in the Revised Statutes, 7th ed. pages 2,501, 2,506, 2,507, 2,517,2,536, 2,537, 2,539,2,565,2,471, 2,473, 2,474, 2,476, 2,478, 2,481, 2,485, 2,499, and in other places. What does it mean where so used ? It means an offense for which the offender is liable to imprisonment in a state prison. And it is impossible to give it any other sensible construction. In the Revised Statutes at page 2,501, above cited, it is provided that a person convicted of perjury committed on any trial for any other felony, shall be sentenced for a term not less than ten years, &amp;c. Does not that mean under the statute definition of felony: “ on the trial of any crime punishable by imprisonment,” &amp;c.? Does it mean only those offenses where the word felony is used in the statute defining the offense? ISTearly all the principal felonies, as arson, burglary, &amp;e., are defined by statute which does not use the word felony at all. In order to know then whether the perjury was on the trial of a felony, it affords no information to look in the statute defining the offense, as in nine cases out of ten the word would not be found at all. Does it mean a felony at common law ? Many of our most serious crimes punishable by long terms of imprisonment were not felonies at common law. Who would doubt that the court in determining the degree of crime on the trial of which the perjury was committed would find a perfect answer to any question as to whether it was a misdemeanor in the above definition ? Who can doubt, that for such cases as that, the statute was passed defining the term felony, that the court might know at a glance at the punishment prescribed whether it was a felony ? <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>So it will be found under numerous provisions of the statute, the word felony is used and its meaning can only be defined by the above provision of the Eevised Statutes. For instance, a witness was formerly incompetent to testify if he had been sentenced for a felony. The Eevised Statutes so provided, and the provision was in the same act which defines a felony. The Eevised Statutes say a person convicted of a felony shall not testify. Another section of the same act says that the term felony, when used in that act, shall be construed to mean an offense, for which on conviction the offender is liable to imprisonment in state prison, &amp;c. Can it be claimed that a witness offered as such who has been sentenced to state prison for ten years, and has served his full term, is competent, notwithstanding the statute, provided the act under which he was sentenced did not use the term felony in defining the crime <em>% </em>Would it be claimed that the common law must determine whether it was a felony or not ? Would it be claimed, that if the word felony was used in the statute under which he was convicted it would be a conviction of sentence for a felony, and if it was not used in the statute, then the common law must decide ? Then of what earthly effect is the statute defining a felony <em>% </em>Is it the law that a crime is not a felony, unless the word felony is found in the statute, defining the crime ? Then murder, treason, arson, rape, burglary, forgery, robbery, larceny, perjury, dueling, bigamy, are all misdemeanors, for the word felony is not used in the definition of any of these offenses. Are we then to go to the common law to learn what is a felony <em>% </em>Then petit larceny is a felony, for it was at common law. Then perjury, forgery and bigamy are misdemeanors, for they are such at common law. See <em>Wharton Crim. Law, </em>§ 2. That the common law does not control is held in People <em>ex rel. </em>Loughlin <em>v. </em>Finn, <a href="/ny/87/0533-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="87 N.Y. 533" data-case-ids="549481" data-case-paths="/ny/87/0533-01">87 N. <em>Y. </em>533</a>, where it is decided that petit larceny is a misdemeanor now, though at common law it was a felony. Then the question as to what is a felony must remain in doubt and consequently confuse the courts and the administration of law, unless we take the definition in the Eevised Statutes as controlling. There can be no doubt that the Legislature intended to give a definition applicable to all cases. Of course, if the statute does declare a crime to be a felony, then it is a <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>felony, whatever the punishment. If the statute is silent in defining the crime as to whether a felony or a misdemeanor, then the punishment prescribed determines the question under the statutory definition. To so hold gives consistency to the criminal law; to hold otherwise leads to confusion, and necessitates a holding that a crime for some purposes is a felony, and for other purposes is a misdemeanor. There is no case holding that the offense here charged was not a felony. There is one under the statute holding that it is. And where is there a case holding that a crime created by statute, not known to the common law, and punishable by imprisonment not to exceed ten years is not a felony ? The second count of the indictment charges the crime of grand larceny. It says that the defendant feloniously obtained, without the consent of the city or its officers, $2,200, belonging to the city and disposed of the same, &amp;c. That would have been a felony at common law. Is it not now under the statute <em>% </em>The degree of punishment, the amount taken, the charge that the money was feloniously taken, should, independently of statutory definition, stamp this as a felony.</p>

So that, for all the purposes of this case, Lyon was just as much a principal in the transaction alleged in the indictment as Bork was; it was the same as if he, Lyon, had himself taken the money from the city treasury and left the check upon Lyon <em>&amp; </em>Co. to represent it to the city treasurer, taken the money to Lyon &amp; Co. and sent it to Hew York to pay the overdrafts of the firm to their Hew York correspondent. This rule would obtain in this case, even though it were a felony, for the reason that no point was raised npon the trial, nor has any suggestion been made by his learned counsel that the defendant should have been tried as accessory instead of principal. Having failed to raise such point, even if it had existed, it would now be held effectually waived, so that there can be no force in the objection that the defendant could not be convicted of the offense of which he is indicted, because at the time of its commission he was in the territory of Utah.

In order, however, to sustain this conviction, it is not necessary to determine whether or not this is a misdemeanor, for Lyon was a principal in the commission of this offense.

How, then, can it be claimed that he is not so liable, when it appears that the firms were insolvent to his knowledge; that the money which carried him to Utah was drawn from the city treasury; that the drafts which he drew there were paid by the city funds, including the sum alleged in the indictment; that upon his return he assented to and ratified the act; and that, subsequent to his return, more money was drawn from the treasury than at any preceding time? If this proof does not establish that he acted as principal, then no person could be convicted as a principal unless he was actually and physically present at <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>the time the act was committed.

On the last page the court say: “ If, however, the felony was concocted between the parties personally, he would in that case be a principal. One need not be present when a crime is committed to constitute him a principal.” Here the jury have found that Lyon entered into the fraudulent scheme; he was an active participant all the while, as he was converting the money while away as effectually as he could here.

Nearly all of the exceptions in this case are to the admission of evidence of the transactions between the firms of Lyon, Bork <em>&amp; </em>Co. and Lyon &amp; Co. with the City Treasurer. As has been heretofore stated, this testimony was admitted for three purposes: First. To prove guilty knowledge upon the part of the defendant. Second. To prove a fraudulent intent; and, Third. To show the existence of a combination and conspiracy. No misapprehension could possibly arise ' upon this branch of the case, and the purposes for which it was offered, for the court instructed the jury that to establish the offense the prosecution must show that in September, 1875, defendant received a sum of money from Joseph Bork, City Treasurer, knowing it was city money and received it to his own use. That constitutes the offense ; but upon the question whether Lyon knew it was city money, and with what intent he received it, this evidence was admitted, and it was limited to that purpose.</p>

Here, as before stated, the transactions were continuous, and the mass of testimony taken in the case shows that the lapse of time, if any intervened, at.no time exceeded three or four days. Some one of the multitude of transactions proved upon the trial happened and occurred upon nearly every day, and especially is this true after the commission of the offense charged in the indictment, between February, 1875, and December 31 of the same year. Lyon’s firms had at that time become so embarrassed that they could not survive a single day without aid from the city treasurer, and from that time the transactions were of almost daily occurrence, when money was taken from the city treasury in some one of the ways and methods proved in this case.

The absence of the defendant from the state required no more proof to establish his guilt than would have been required if he had been in the city and in the office of the firm, and had not actually participated in the particular act in question. In either case, it would depend upon his relation to the transaction arising out of the fact whether the instrumentality could be treated as his. He did not actually direct to be done this specific act, nor was it necessary that he should, to constitute his guilt, if, as the jury have found there was a common purpose existing between him and Bork—a system or scheme to appropriate the city money for the purposes of the business of their firm, which may be characterized as a conspiracy,—then the act of one, would be the act of both, and each, while that purpose and relation continued. And having reached that conclusion, the question of intent to defraud the city, within the meaning of the law, was a less difficult one for the jury. The purposes of acts may, to some extent, be deemed characterized by their consequences. It may be assumed, at all events, that there was sufficient to justify the conclusion that the defendant knew that it was the duty of certain constituted authorities of the city to designate banks in which its moneys should be deposited by the treasurer; that the firm of Lyon &amp; Co. was not a designated depositary of them ; and that those moneys had no business in that firm, and it had no business with them. In view of all the circumstances, some of which have before been referred to, the jury were authorized to charge the defendant with receiving the $2,200 with the intent to defraud the city of Buffalo. If, however, the offense charged is felony, the conviction cannot stand.</p>

That provision of the Revised Statutes has had some attention of the courts, and has seemingly given some conflict to their decisions upon the question.
