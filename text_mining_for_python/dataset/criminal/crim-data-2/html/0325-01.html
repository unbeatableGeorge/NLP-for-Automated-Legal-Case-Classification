The decision and rulings sought to be reviewed were given upon a trial before the justice, upon a complaint made against Conrad Scherer by his wife, the relator herein, for abandonment. The justice refused to admit certain testimony offered on behalf of this relator and dismissed the complaint. The charge was made under section 899 of Code of Criminal Procedure, subd. 1, and the first question to be disposed of is whether the action .of the magistrate can be reviewed by certiorari.</p>
    <p id="b350-9" data-blocks='[["BL_350.11",350,[362,1594,1158,435]]]'>By section 515 of Code, of Criminal Procedure, writs of certiorari in criminal actions, as they have heretofore existed are abolished, and a review had by an appeal; but this section refers only to criminal actions as defined in that Code. The proceeding before the magistrate was not strictly a criminal action, but was a special proceeding of a criminal nature, under part 6 of the Criminal Code, title .7. No right of appeal seems to be provided for under this part. of the Criminal Code, except under title 5—“ Of proceedings respecting bastards.”</p>

This distinction is rendered more apparent by referring to title 2, part 6, of the Criminal Code, sections 950, 951 and 952. It is clear therefore that no right of appeal was given by the Code to either party in this proceeding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> It cannot be claimed that an appeal was authorized by section 749, which provides for appeals from judgments rendered by a court of Special Sessions.</p>
