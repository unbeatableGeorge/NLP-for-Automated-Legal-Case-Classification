Upon the return to the writs, the learned justice then sitting at Special Term undertook to pass upon the competency and sufficiency of the evidence taken before the magistrate, thereby confusing the functions of the common law writ of certiorari and the statutory writ of certiorari, which last is provided for by § 2015 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (a.) Of the common law writ of certiorari, or writ of error, it has been held that “ the office of the writ is to correct errors of a judicial character ” (People <em>ex rel. </em>Savage <em>v. </em>Board <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>of Health, <a href="/barb/33/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="33 Barb. 344" data-case-ids="5061962" data-case-paths="/barb/33/0344-01">33 <em>Barb. </em>344</a>); “ that application for the writ must be made to the court and not to a judge at chambers ; that it is not a writ of right, but rests in the sound discretion of the court to which application for it may be made, and, when granted, it seems, must regularly be made returnable at the General Term.” The People <em>ex rel. </em>Mayor <em>v. </em>Nichols, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Hun%2C%20530" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="18 Hun, 530">18 <em>Hun, </em>530</a>. (b.) The office of the statutory writ of certiorari, such as the one allowed in this case, is “ to inquire into • the cause of imprisonment or restraint” (§ 2015, <em>Code Civ. Pro.)-, </em>application for the writ may be made to a justice at chambers (§ 2017, <em>Code Civ. Pro.); </em>it is a writ of right, and does not lie in the discretion of the court (§ 2020); the writ may be returnable to a judge at chambers, (e.) In the case of a common law certiorari, it has been held by the Court of Appeals (1868) that the court may consider the materiality and sufficiency of the evidence upon the return (People <em>ex rel. </em>Cook <em>v. </em>Board of Police, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20N.Y.%20516" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="39 N.Y. 516">39 <em>N. Y. </em>516</a>), but more recently (1880) that court has laid down a contrary rule and held that the judgment of a tribunal having jurisdiction ought not to be disturbed <em>“ </em>unless there is.an entire absence of evidence “ to sustain it” (People <em>ex rel. </em>Hart <em>v. </em>Board of Fire Commissioners, <a href="/ny/82/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="82 N.Y. 358" data-case-ids="2177160" data-case-paths="/ny/82/0358-01">82 <em>N.

The form prescribed in this article reads substantially as follows : “ We command you that you certify fully and at large the day and cause of the imprisonment of C. D., by you detained, etc.” The statute not only confers no power of review upon the justice to whom the return is made, but imperatively directs him to remand the prisoner where it appears that the prisoner is detained by virtue of a final judgment of a competent tribunal of criminal jurisdiction, as in the present case (§ 2032, <em>Code Civ. Pro.) (e.) </em>The question as to the right of the court or justice to review the sufficiency of the testimony on habeas corpus and certiorari was passed upon in the Matter of Mary Miller, 1 <em>Abb. </em>Abb. <em>C. </em>4, note.</p>

If the commitment was irregular in form, it was the duty of the justice before whom the child was brought on the return of the writ, to remand her under § 2035 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The section mentioned provides, that if, upon the testimony offered with the return, or upon the hearing thereon, it appears that the prisoner has been guilty of an offense, although the commitment is irregular, the court or judge before which <em>or </em>whom he is brought must forthwith make a final order to discharge him upon his giving bail, if the offense is bailable, or if it is not bailable, to remand him.</p>

Upon this complaint, this child, twelve years of age, was taken, without counsel, before the magistrate, and without a plea or confession, and without being confronted by witnesses, and without the slightest testimony being taken or evidence produced to substantiate the charges against her, was condemned. How it cannot be said in this case, as it was in the matter of Sarah and Betsey Moses, that, “the testimony upon which the conviction was had may well have been taken orally by the court,” for the reason that the only paper testimony returned in answer to the writ of certiorari is the affidavit of the complainant, the complaint; the adjournment of July 8 to July 9, 1884; the conviction. As the law stood previous to the adoption of the Penal Code in like cases, “ It shall be proved to the satisfaction of such magistrate by competent testimony that said child is embraced within said section.” Laws of 1857, chap. 249, §§ 1, 2, as amended; Laws of 1878, chap. 165, § 1; Laws of 1882, chap. 410, § 1602, entitled, “An act to consolidate into one act and to declare the special and local laws affecting public interests in the City of Hew York.” The omission of the words “ it shall be proved to the satisfaction of such magistrate, by competent testimony, that said child is embraced within said section,” from § 291 of the Penal Code, does not give the magistrate power to satisfy himself solely by the aver<a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>ments contained in the complaint, but it is still necessary that he should be satisfied by competent testimony. In order to convict the child of the offense charged in the complaint, it was necessary that there should have been some proof, other than the complaint, that she was found in the company of a reputed prostitute, and that said child habitually frequented the company of reputed prostitutes. Ho such proof was offered, and none was received. As well might the facts set forth in a criminal complaint be deemed sufficient to convict a person charged with crime without further proof of the facts charged in such complant, as that the child could have been convicted of the offense charged against her upon this complaint, without the facts therein contained having been proved to the satisfaction of the magistrate by “ competent testimony.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b558-4" data-blocks='[["BL_558.4",558,[316,1063,1164,1175]]]'>II. It may be .urged perhaps that the Special Term of this court did not acquire jurisdiction over the subject matter presented to it by habeas corpus and certiorari, as § 515 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, provides that <em>“ </em>Writs of error and certiorari in criminal actions and proceeding- and special proceedings of a criminal nature, as they have heretofore existed, are abolished, and hereafter the only mode of reviewing a judgment or order in a criminal action or proceeding, or special proceedings of a criminal nature, is by appeal.” Section 519 enumerates the several instances in which an appeal may be taken. By subdivision 3, an appeal may be taken <em>“ </em>From a final determination affecting the substantial right of a defendant.” How in the matter at bar there was no final determination of the matter before the magistrate; there was solely a complaint, an adjournment, a re-arraignment, and sentence without warrant or authority of law, from which an appeal would not lie. If a person should be arraigned at the bar upon an indictment, and no plea had been taken, nor testimony given to substantiate the facts charged in the indictment, “ a final determination affecting a substantial right of the defendant” would not be determined by the court passing sentence, and no appeal could be taken from such unwarranted proceedings; it could only be reversed on habeas corpus and certiorari. The principle contended for here was virtually decided in Marble v. Lewis, <a href="/how-pr/36/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="36 How.

She was so committed for violating subdivision 1 of section 291 of the Penal Code of the State. By that section a female child, actually or apparently under the age of fourteen years, who is found begging, or receiving or soliciting alms in any manner or under any pretense, may, by subdivision 5, be arrested and brought before a court or magistrate as a vagrant, disorderly or destitute child, and the court or magistrate is authorized to commit the child to any charitable reformatory or other institution authorized by law to receive and take charge of minors. No controversy has been made as to the authority of the sisters of the order to receive the custody of the child under these provisions of the Penal Code. Neither was the commitment under which she was consigned to their custody in any manner informal or defective in carrying out these directions of the law. But still, an application was made by the petitioner for a writ of habeas corpus and certiorari to discharge the child from the custody of the sisters.

The provisions contained in the habeas corpus act furnish no authority, after a final determination has been made by the magistrate, for requiring him, in answer to a writ of certiorari, to certify and return the evidence taken before him to a judge or court proceeding under the authority of this act. What is to be done under and by virtue of the writ of habeas corpus when it may be lawfully issued has been clearly defined and prescribed, and a certiorari has only been provided for in place of the habeas corpus itself, and when that writ may not prudently be issued. <em>Code, </em>§ 2041.

S. </em>6th ed. 877, §§ 41, 42.</p>

And that such a review was neither contemplated nor intended, clearly results from the directions contained in section 2032 of the Code. For that has directed that the court or judge must forthwith make a final order to remand the prisoner if it appears that he is detained in custody by virtue of a mandate issued by a court or judge of the United States having exclusive jurisdiction of the case, or second, by virtue of the final judgment or decree of a competent tribunal of civil or criminal jurisdiction, or the final order of such a tribunal made in a special proceeding instituted for any cause, except to punish him for a contempt, or by virtue of an execution or other process issued upon such judgment, decree, or final order. This direction excludes, by necessary and clear implication, the authority to inquire into the force and effect of the evidence upon which the determination may have been made. They are no more than a repetition of those previously contained in the Revised Statutes. And this construction is further sustained by those contained in section 2033 of the Code, declaring the cases in which the person may be relieved from imprisonment, neither of which includes or justifies a review of the evidence resulting in the judgment or order of the court or officer. Even the much criticised case of People <em>v. </em>Liscomb (60 <em>N. 7. </em>559), does not permit an inquiry into the effect of the evidence to be made. For by that it was held that the court, or officer, could not go behind the judgment and inquire into errors or irregularities preceding it, to determine whether it had been properly entered or not, but was confined to the judgment and process itself in the hearing and decision which might be made.</p>

The commitment was that of a child of about four years of age, who was accused of frequenting the company of prostitutes and of being found with a reputed prostitute. This brought the case within subdivision 4 of section 391 of the Penal Code, and authorized the magistrate before whom the child was taken to commit her to the custody of this society. The commitment which was returned showed a full compliance with the provisions of the statute, and completely answered the application made for the discharge of the child. The court, however, in this as in the other case, by means of a writ of certiorari directed to the magistrate, entered upon a review of the evidence produced for his consideration ; and deeming that not sufficient to warrant his determination, ordered the discharge of the child. For the reasons already assigned, this proceeding was without the sanction of the law, and the order should be reversed, the writs dismissed, and the child recommitted to the custody of the appellant.</p>
