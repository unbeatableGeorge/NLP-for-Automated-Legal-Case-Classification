It cannot be seriously contended that the mere legislative declaration, that a law is in the interest of public health, makes it so beyond review by the courts, for the Legislature is not the sole and final judge of the matter.

If the power of the Legislature in the premises is absolute and final, there would be nothing to hinder it from prohibiting the clatter of the sewing machine used by a tailor in a tenement house, because it injures the health of the nervous co-tenants. The use of the grinding-wheel causes cutlers to contract bleeding of the lungs and cousumption. If persons wear thin-soled shoes in stormy weather, they are prone to contract disease. Can the Legislature interfere by way of prohibition, in any of these instances ? In brief, can the Legislature legislate upon every act, matter or thing, trivial or important, which may have an influence on the health of the individual ? And can it with subtle refinement and distinction, declare a thing to be healthy on one floor and the same thing to be unhealthy on the next floor of the same house ? The police power of the Legislature must have limits. It cannot prove as boundless as infinite space, nor can it contract and expand itself within the narrow regions of one law, by declaring that to be lawful on the first floor which it declares to be unlawful on the second floor- of the same house. Hay, whereby it makes an act criminal, if committed in a house occupied by four families which, if committed in a house occupied by three families, is not a crime.

      <em>a. </em>Anterior to the passage of this act, the relator, in common with the thousands of others pursuing the same trade, was gaining his livelihood by making cigars in his own dwelling house. The trade or vocation was a lawful one. The product of his labor was proscribed by no law ; its manufacture and sale, as well as his personal industry in it, were on the common line of honest and useful occupations. Nearly two thousand families, comprising nearly eight thousand persons, were engaged in this industry in their own homes. Of the 840.000. 000 cigars manufactured in a year in the city of New York, 370,000,000 were manufactured by makers who worked as families, each in their own dwelling. The remaining 470.000. 000 cigars produced in the city of New York were manufactured in factories or workshops, employing large numbers of. men and women, young and old, in promiscuous association, and exposed to all the mischiefs, physical and moral, that are inseparable from crowded factories and incongruous collections of operatives. Suddenly, there comes upon these home laborers, from the Legislature of the state, an edict, or, to borrow an appropriate and hateful word from foreign and feudal tyranny, a ban, proclaiming that, after a certain day, to earn their livelihood, by making cigars, as families and in their homes, should be a crime, and that all persons pursuing this, their accustomed trade, by families and in their homes, should be punished by fine and imprisonment. That this legislation takes, at a blow, from these poor people “the means whereby they live,” that it subverts their family industry—that it drives them from their homes into compulsory gregarious employments in their own trade, or the acquisition and exercise of some new employment, that, in a word, it breaks up their property in their own skill, faculties and labor, and constrains their liberty in the choice of the circum<a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>stances, place and manner in which they will pursue their honest calling, and regulate their domestic life; and that all this mischief and misery is inflicted by statute, and not <em>“ </em>by the law of the land or the judgment of their peers,”—is indisputable. The legal test, then, of this legislative treatment of these <em>“ </em>members of this state,” as being or not unconstitutional, is a very simple one. If this act deprives them “ of any of the rights and privileges secured to any citizen ” of this state, then it is unconstitutional for repugnancy to article I. section 1 of the Constitution, the clause now under consideration.</p>

      <em>b. </em>It is important, to consider the particular traits of this legislation which stamp its true character as a mere edict against those at whom it is launched, and not within the public /authority lodged in the Legislature by the Constitution. The domestic manufacture of cigars is lawful as before in all parts of this state, except virtually the cities of Hew York and Brooklyn. The manufacture in crowded factories, in the cities of Hew York and Brooklyn, where great numbers of work people are exposed to whatever injuries may arise from the treatment and manipulation of the great mass of tobacco there handled, is lawful as before. The industry by families in their dwellings, is by the act itself made lawful, as before, on the first floor of a tenement house in the city of Hew York or Brooklyn, provided only there be, also, on that floor <em>“ </em>a store for the sale of cigars and tpbacco.” The Board of Health of the city of Hew York, officially declared, after careful investigation, <em>“ </em>that the health of the tenement house population is not jeopardized by the manufacture of cigars in those houses; that this bill is not a sanitary measure, and that it has not been approved by this Board.” The rate of mortality in the cigar tenement houses was only about nine in a thousand, when the general rate in the whole city was about thirty-one in a thousand. The scheme of the act shows that any pretension that the public health is implicated in this family industry in their homes, is preposterous. The act allows the same amount of manufacture, in a tenement house, provided that no more than three families, do their cooking on the premises, no matter how many more families occupy the house for every other purpose. The pretension that the health of the occupants of a tenement <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>house, as a body, is the object of public care, is disproved, (1) because the act proscribes the family industry in their homes when four families occupy a whole house or apartments in a house not a tenement, and permits it when three families dwell therein; and (2) because the manufacture is allowed on the first floor if there be a cigar or tobacco store besides,- and on every other floor, or in the whole house if no more than three families do their cooking therein. This exposes the act in its true character and operation, to wit, as a measure to drive the home laborers into the public factories. This breaks up the free competition of the two systems, places the whole industry under the dominion of organized capital and combination on the one hand, and lays it open on the other to the unrestrained domination of trades unions, and compulsory strikes or pitiless persecution.</p>

      <em>c. </em>The true character of the act is not disguised or obscured to judicial scrutiny by the title of the act naming it as “An Act to improve the public health by prohibiting ” this family industry in their homes.

The courts will not review the question of the expediency, necessity or reasonableness of an act passed by virtue of said power. The title of the act is a positive statement of the Legislature, that it meant to exercise said power, and that it- considered the use of tenement-houses in the manner described in the act as prejudicial to public health. By passing the said act, the Legislature determined the facts detrimental to public health within the purview of the said act, and this determination will not be reviewed by the courts.

It does not take away property ; it merely regulates its use. The owner of a tenement house affected by said act is not deprived either of the title or the possession. The use of his property by any other lawful purpose is unrestricted. The appellant invokes an alleged analogy between the exercise of the police power of the state and its power of eminent domain. The two powers and their natures and the conditions, under which they are exercised, must not be confounded. They are distinct powers and differ substantially in their essence, and the constitutional conditions as to their exercise. Under the police power property is not taken for public use, but its use is regulated, and sometimes in extreme cases of emergency the property itself is destroyed. The power of eminent domain is expressly and directly limited, and its exercise regulated by the Constitution, which is not the case as to the police power.

It is the undoubted province of the courts to decide whether or not any particular act was or was not upon its face passed by the Legislature in the exercise of its police power and as a health law. When the title of such an act is a manifest lie, when the act itself shows that its title is a fraudulent label, when the act plainly and clearly proves that it was passed without facts upon which the Legislature exercised its discretion, then the courts may declare such an act unconstitutional. But this is not the case with the act under review. Its title corresponds with the text. It is evident that the Legislature has <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>come to the conclusion that the manufacture of cigars or preparation of tobacco in any portion of a tenement house, occupied as a home or residence for the purpose of living, sleeping, cooking or doing any household work therein, is noxious, offensive, prejudicial to health, and this finding of the Legislature is conclusive, and cannot be disturbed or set aside by the courts. In the Matter of N. Y. Elevated R. R. Co. (<a href="/citations/?q=70%20N.Y.%20351" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="70 N.Y. 351">70 <em>N. Y. </em>351</a>), the court said: <em>“ </em>But it is claimed that there was but one elevated railway in actual operation at the time of the passage of the act, and hence that it must be deemed that the Legislature had sole reference to that. It was well said by Allen, J., in People <em>ex rel. </em>Bolton <em>v. </em>Albertson (<a href="/ny/55/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="55 N.Y. 50" data-case-ids="517497" data-case-paths="/ny/55/0050-01">55 <em>N. Y. </em>50</a>), that <em>“ </em>no motive, purpose or intent can be imputed to the Legislature in the enactment of a law other than such as are apparent upon the face, and to be gathered from the terms of the law itself.” See People <em>ex rel. </em>Wood <em>v. </em>Draper, <a href="/ny/15/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="15 N.Y. 532" data-case-ids="2018085" data-case-paths="/ny/15/0532-01">15 <em>N. Y. </em>532</a>, 545, 555. Tenement houses are a particular kind of buildings, known to and defined by the law. Laws of 1867, chap. 908, § 17. The Legislature has thrown special safeguards around them in regard to their sanitary condition. <em>Jb. </em>§§ 1 to 18. They are considered a public evil, but born by the necessity of certain localities, and under the present condition of society, not capable of being suppressed, but merely mitigated. And mitigation of the evil is all the Legislature has attempted to accomplish by said act. It does not prohibit the manufacture of cigars and the preparation of tobacco in the tenement houses as a whole. The exceptions which the law makes to its principle—as the exemption of the first floor where there is a store for the sale of cigars, and such floors of which no part is used for dwelling purposes, —and which the appellant urges against the constitutionality of the said act, are evidence that the Legislature desired but to mitigate, not to suppress the evil, which, in the mind of the Legislature, exists in the manufacture of cigars, etc., in tenement houses. If the courts should undertake to declare this act unconstitutional, then the said Law of 1867 would also be clearly unconstitutional, as it regulates the use of tenement houses in the most extensive and detailed manner, prohibiting among other the use of any vault, cellar or underground room as a place of lodging or sleeping (§ 7), and the storage of any article <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>dangerous to life and detrimental to health (§ 8). The dangers with which tenement houses threaten public health are such a notorious fact that in the Matter of Application of Paul (<a href="/ny-crim/2/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="2 N.Y. Crim. 1" data-case-ids="1167674" data-case-paths="/ny-crim/2/0001-01">2 N. <em>Y. Crim. Rep. </em>1</a>) the Court of Appeals took judicial notice of them. There is an essential and vital difference in substance and kind between the act of determining whether a given use is a public one, and the act of determining whether a law is a police or health law. Whether a use is or is not a public one, is a question dependent upon facts easily understood and ascertained beyond any doubt. The question of expediency has nothing to do with it. It is a plain question of definition, is the given use public or private <em>\ </em>Mot so, however, the question whether any specific act or thing is or is not prejudicial to the public health. As to such a question the wildest differences of opinion exist in many cases in which all the facts capable of any definite ascertainment are fully known. This question is one of expediency. It is theoretical, speculative and purely matter of opinion in the majority of cases and not capable of actual and indubitable solution or demonstration. The analogy, so far as eminent domain is concerned, is between health laws and the expediency of a public use, and not between such laws and the fact of a public use. This question of expediency in cases of eminent domain is held to be a purely legislative and not a judicial one. <em>In re </em>Townsend, <a href="/ny/39/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="39 N.Y. 171" data-case-ids="502231" data-case-paths="/ny/39/0171-01">39 N. <em>Y. </em>171</a>-174. In People <em>ex rel. </em>Herrick <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/ny/21/0641-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="21 N.Y. 595" data-case-ids="1749977" data-case-paths="/ny/21/0641-01">21 N. <em>Y. </em>595</a>, at page 598, this court says : “ The necessity for appropriating private property for the use of the public or of the government is not a judicial question. The power resides in the Legislature.” This is the rule applied to all cases of the exercise of police powers. That the question as to whether or no any specific act is, or is not within the police power as a health law, is analogous to and to be treated upon the same principles as the question of the expediency or necessity of a public use is well illustrated by the cases of Stuyvesant, Coates and others against the Mayor, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Cow.%20585" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="7 Cow. 585">7 <em>Cow. </em>585</a>. In these cases the Legislature had given the municipal authorities power to pass certain by-laws “ if the corporation find it necessary.” The by-laws were passed, and suits were brought upon them. There was no averment in the declaration that the corporation found the by-laws necessary, nor was <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>there in the by-laws any recital of any adjudication of necessity, nor did the declaration aver that in truth the by-law was necessary. At pages 606, etc., the court says : “ For all or some of these reasons it is contended that the by-law, as pleaded, must be adjudged void. To be a corporation is a franchise, and all our aggregate corporations enjoy the prerogatives of government to a prescribed extent. Among these is the power to pass by-laws upon certain subjects. They cannot transcend the powers conferred on them by statute. This is their constitution. ¡Neither can the state or general government transcend the powers conferred by their constitutions. Every act beyond the constitution is void, and may be declared so by our courts of justice, whether it emanated from a general or local Legislature. An unwarrantable interference with private property is equally unconstitutional and void, whether by the state Legislature or a corporation. By neither can it be touched without necessity, and then, if taken, it must be upon just compensation. This necessity is not absolute. It is nearly synonymous with expediency or what is necessary for the public good. The word necessary, when applied to a law, or taking private property, is constantly understood and acted upon in this sense, or as contra-distinguished from unnecessary or inexpedient. . It is of the nature of legislative bodies to judge of the exigency upon which their laws are founded; and when they speak, their judgment is implied in the law itself. It is sufficient, therefore, to set it forth in pleading. This is equivalent to an averment that the exigency has arisen, been adjudicated and acted upon. All to be shown beyond this, is matter by which the court may see that the law operates upon the subject of the power. The implied adjudication is then taken as conclusive; if not so, the exigency itself would be the subject to traverse and trial by jury. To say that it must be averred, in pleading, would be to require that the propriety or expediency of every law should be tried as matter <em>in pais. </em>Such a consequence was never contended for in relation to the acts of the lowest judicial magistrate in the community.” The court then refers with approval to the case of Martin <em>v. </em>Mott, <a href="/us/25/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="12 Wheat. 19" data-case-ids="1429901" data-case-paths="/us/25/0019-01">12 <em>Wheat. </em>19</a>, where, under a statute authorizing the President of the United States to call forth the militia whenever the country should be invaded or in <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>imminent danger of invasion, it was held that the President was constitued by the act the exclusive judge of the exigency, and that his simple requisition, which recited nothing about danger, invasion or exigency, was conclusive evidence that he had passed as a judge on the case. The court then says, “if such strong judicial intendment prevails in favor of a single officer executing a law, <em>a fortiori, </em>should it be exercised in favor of the law-making power itself.” In Stuyvesant <em>v. </em>Mayor, <em>T Cow. </em>588, the court, speaking of a by-law relating to the public health, and to be treated as a health law passed by the Legislature, places the power to pass it upon the same grounds with, and speaks of it in the same language as it does of the “ necessity or exigency ” for “ taking private property.” It holds the Legislature to be the sole judge in each case, and its determination in each case to be conclusive. As stated before, whether the protection of the health, comfort and lives of the public will be promoted by the act in question, is a matter of inference, speculation, judgment and discretion and not one of simple definition or demonstration. As was said in the case of Gordon <em>v. </em>Cornes <em>(supra), </em>as to the power to apportion taxes, so it can be truly said here, the power to decide is left with the Legislature and its decision cannot be reviewed by the courts in the absence of constitutional restraints and restrictions, unless in extreme cases, where confessedly no discretion had been exercised, but that had arbitrarily been called a health law which could not reasonably be regarded by the Legislature as such, it having palpably no connection with matters of public health. If this be not so, then the courts will be called on to substitute their judgment for that of the legislature in all cases of laws relating to the public health, and possibly juries must try the question.

The attempt of the Legislature to determine the public character of the use, does not settle that it has the right to do so, but the existence of the public use in any class of cases is a question to be determined by the courts. The presumption is in favor of the public character of a use declared to be public by the Legislature (West. Penn. Inst. <em>v. </em>Edgewood R. R., <a href="/pa/79/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="79 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="438429" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0257-01">79 <em>Pa. </em>257</a>), and unless it is seen at the first blush that it is not possible for the use to be public, the courts cannot interfere.

R. <em>v. </em>Stockton, <a href="/cal/41/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="41 Cal. 147" data-case-ids="4391336" data-case-paths="/cal/41/0147-01">41 <em>Cal. </em>147</a>. If the use is certainly a public one, then the legislative authority over the subject cannot be restrained or supervised by the courts. Only where it is plainly perceived that there is an attempt to evade the law and procure the condemnation of property for a private use or to accomplish an end not public in its character, will the courts declare the act void. Pittsburg <em>v. </em>Scott, <a href="/pa/1/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="1 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="949843" data-case-paths="/pa/1/0309-01">1 <em>Pa.

In the Stuyvesant case, <em>supra, </em>the court says the power thus conferred is the “ constitution ” of the municipal body in such cases. Surely an act of the Legislature will not be held more vulnerable than municipal ordinances passed under powers conferred by the Legislature. <em>Ex parte </em>Smith <em>v. </em>Keating, <a href="/cal/38/0702-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="38 Cal. 702" data-case-ids="2246191" data-case-paths="/cal/38/0702-01">38 <em>Cal. </em>702</a>, involved the validity of an ordinance prohibiting any woman from being, after twelve o’clock at night, in any place where beer or liquor was sold and drank.

No purer case of one doing himself an injury can be stated than that of an attempt to commit suicide. This is made a criminal act by the Code. It has never been suggested that' this was beyond the power of the state. There are numerous other laws of a similar character. Minors under a certain age are prohíbitéd from working in factories, and compelled to attend school; they are prohibited from working at certain trades, and from taking part in theatrical and other performances; gymnasts are prohibited from performing certain dangerous feats without net-tings being placed below them for their protection .in case they fall.</p>

That the act permits that to be done on the first floor, where there is a store, which it prohibits on other floors ; or that it in other respects prohibits under some circumstances what it permits under others, is of no consequence. That tenement houses in Mew York city are hotbeds of disease, and a constant menace to the health of the city, is notorious. That the legislature did not exercise all the power it had in the premises, or exercised what it did in a mode and to an extent not perhaps the most effectual, is no objection to the validity of the act or to the power of the Legislature.

It is not constitutionally competent, therefore, for the legislature to deprive by any arbitrary enactment a laborer in any lawful vocation of his right to work and enjoy the fruits of his work in his own residence and in his own way, except for the purposes of police or health regulations as hereinafter considered. It is equally true also that when an artizan or laborer has rented a tenement for the residence of his family, with the right to cany on his trade or occupation therein, he has thereby acquired certain rights of property in the use and enjoyment of his tenement, of which he cannot be deprived without due .process of law.

We think we find abundant evidence of this object on the face of the act. First it selects for its field of operation from the general and numerous tenement houses of the city, a limited class, to wit, such as are “ <em>occupied as the home or residence of more than three families living </em>independently of one another, and doing their cooking upon the premises.” The result of this selection is, that all tenement houses having more than three, or more than twenty families, living in common or not doing their cooking on the premises are not within the act. Certainly, if health were the object, all such tenements would be embraced for they are especially within the professed mischief. It is the thronged and overcrowded tenements, which swarm from cellar to attic with tenants who live, not independently, but in promiscuous dependence, without cooking in their tenements but from hand to mouth in the streets and grog-shops, or as beggars at houses for food, whose health most needs the <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>protection of police regulations; but they are not included within the act.</p>
    <p id="b396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_396.4",396,[347,475,1158,723]]]'>Again, by the 3rd section, the first floor of the designated tenement is exempt from the operation of the law if in addition to the manufacture, there be a store for selling cigars and tobacco on that floor. That fact, if health were the object, should be a reason for more stringent restriction instead of exception, because it would cause that floor to be the resort of more persons whose health might be exposed; but one nuisance to health is in the theory of the act, cured by another. It is of no consequence that on the same floor there may be a half dozen families, each carrying on the manufacture of cigars or tobacco in their living rooms, where they eat, sleep and cook. They are not subject to the law while the head of a family on the next or any other floor of the same tenement, is a criminal for carrying on his occupation of manufacturing cigars in any room of such floor.</p>
    <p id="b396-5" data-blocks='[["BL_396.5",396,[347,1212,1159,1078]],["BL_397.1",397,[124,395,1158,132]]]'>Surely this sort of discrimination must be based upon some other idea than the health of tenants, or of the public. It is too vicious to be just or lawful. But in the prohibited tenement, the manufacture is made criminal only “ on any floor or part of any floor occupied by any person as a home or residence for the purpose of living, sleeping, cooking or doing any household work therein.” This section has no regard to the size of the floor. There may be ten or twenty rooms (and in some of the tenement houses there are numerous rooms on each floor), isolated so as to have no communication with each other, yet the bare fact that some person eats or sleeps or lives in one of the most distant rooms of the floor, without communication or connection with that used for the business, makes it a crime to manufacture cigars in any other room on that floor. Again, under this act every one of the seven rooms occupied by the appellant and his family may be used for the purpose of manufacturing cigars and tobacco by himself or other tenants occupying the several floors above for the purpose of living, sleeping, cooking and doing household work, and the case will not be within the statute. If the aim be to protect health why is not such case brought within the prohibition ? But it may be argued that the intention was to make the manufacture criminal <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>only because of danger to the health of persons who live or sleep or cook or do some sort of household work, on the same floor.</p>
    <p id="b397-4" data-blocks='[["BL_397.4",397,[124,541,1158,380]]]'>Why then, it may be repeated, is the exception made which allows the health of such persons to be exposed, if only there be the addition on the same floor of a store to sell cigars and tobacco <em>% </em>Health is absolutely lost sight of in such a case, and no sensible reason can be perceived for such an exception unless indeed some promoter of the law happens to be in that condition as a maker and vender, and needed the exception to protect him.</p>
    <p id="b397-5" data-blocks='[["BL_397.5",397,[123,935,1158,483]]]'>But again, if the health of occupants of the same floor were alone in view, why is the act applied only to tenements occupied as the home or residence of more than three families ? If the occupants are limited to three families or less, any or every one of them may make cigars or manufacture tobacco in any or every room on his floor, and the act does not condemn it. It is not easy to see, if the object be to protect the health of persons living on the floor of the manufacture, why such health docs not require as much protection in the case of three tenants in the same building as of four.</p>
    <p id="b397-6" data-blocks='[["BL_397.6",397,[124,1424,1155,336]]]'>Under the act, if there be but three families <em>a </em>living independent of one another, and doing their cooking on the premises,” either may manufacture cigars or tobacco in a floor and in the living rooms of any number of people without limit; but if there be four families in the tenement no one can manufacture cigars on any floor which is by any one person occupied for doing any household work whatever.</p>

It strikes with unjust and cruel severity a class of humble manufacturers, too poor to live elsewhere than in crowded tenement houses, unable to have a store on their premises, or to rent a shop outside of their residences in which to do their work, but constrained by the necessities of their families or themselves to use a part of their rooms to carry on their daily occupation. They are singled out with keen discrimination, and their industry is made a <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>crime, unless they submit to abandon it or find employment outside of their homes. If the act were general, and aimed at all tenement houses, and prohibited, for sanitary reasons, the manufacture of cigars and tobacco in all such buildings, or if it prohibited such manufacture in the living rooms of all tenants, another case would be presented. But in the form in which it comes before us, it is unjust in its inequality, so harsh and oppressive upon the labor of poverty, so keenly discriminative in favor of the stronger classes engaged in the same occupation, that it certainly ought not to have been enacted; but being enacted, ought to be held invalid, because it deprives the appellant of his right and liberty to use his occupation in his own house for the support of himself and family, and takes away the value of his labor, which is his property, protected by the Constitution equally as though it were in lands or money, without due process of law.</p>

But they have not been included, and their exclusion is strong evidence that other reasons than the protection of health induced the passage of the act. If it were necessary for one city, it was for all. But by its enactment, what is a perfectly lawful occupation in all other cities, is made a criminal offense under precisely similar circumstances in New York and Brooklyn. It deprived persons from there doing what it left them at full liberty to do elsewhere. The discrimination was conspicuously unjust, and not warranted by the fundamental law of the state.</p>
