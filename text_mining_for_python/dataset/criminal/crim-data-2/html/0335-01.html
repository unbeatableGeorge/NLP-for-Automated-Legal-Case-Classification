Two say that he has general paresis; one says that he is an imbecile, and another that he suffers from melancholia. He can not have all these conditions at one and the same time; insanity in its initial stages and in its progressed stages cannot co-exist in the same person. But whatever may be the views of the learned experts, I have searched in vain through all this evidence to find any convincing proof of any one act of the defendant, during the period embraced in the examination, which itself proved insanity. Particular instances of foolish and impetuous acts, committed at long intervals, some of which being such as any self-willed or impulsive person might, under certain circum<a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>stances do, cannot prove actual unsoundness of mind, and a general judgment passed to-day upon the quality of an isolated act, committed years ago, is of but little value in determining a question of present sanity.</p>
    <p id="b369-4" data-blocks='[["BL_369.4",369,[183,574,1156,866]]]'>There is a singular deficiency of evidence of positive facts, indicating insanity, and as the learned Dr. Detmold says in his opinion, the expert evidence is “ rather weak.” The record before me fully justifies the conclusion of Commissioner Patterson “ that the defendant is a nervous, impulsive and self-willed person.” These are facts not of observation alonethey fully appear in evidence. His physical peculiarities are also testified to, but they are in many instances explained. Any one reading his cross-examination, which was mainly conducted by the learned and able counsel of his relatives (who it must be presumed was in possession of all the material facts relating to the life of the defendant), must be convinced that the defendant has an extraordinary memory, a clear and graphic power of expression, a coherent way of speaking and good judgment in answering perplexing questions, “and that he is for all the purposes of pleading and instructing counsel in the preparation and conduct of his defense, a sane man within the meaning and intent of the law.”</p>

But if the inquiry which the commission was authorized to make into the defendant’s mental condition at the time of the commission of the act alleged to be criminal, and the evidence, did sustain the claim of the learned district attorney and counsel for the relatives of the defendant, that he was then insane in consequence of delusions entertained by him, he would not be relieved from the consequences of his criminal act if the evidence satisfied a jury that he knew the nature and quality of the act alleged to be criminal, or that the act was <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>wrongful. And in this present proceeding it is sufficient to put him to his defense, that the fact be established to the satisfaction of the court, that he is capable of rightly understanding his own condition, the nature of the charge against him, and of conducting his defense in a rational manner, and that fact appearing, he is not insane, within the meaning of the law, although on some subjects his mind might possibly be deranged.
