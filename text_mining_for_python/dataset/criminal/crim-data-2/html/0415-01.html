These mills were the property of Isaac A. Graves and Gilbert Bradford, and were situated on the corner of Mill and Biver streets. The office was in the corner of the mill facing these streets. <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>It was entered from a door on River street. There was one office window facing River street and two facing Mill street. The mill proper was entered from the office through a door which springs together. There was a high desk or counter in the office running parallel with it, in which was a money-drawer. Behind this desk in a recess in the wall of the office the safe was located. There was one door that lead into the mill from River street. The only other entrance to the mill was through a double door on the Mill street side that opens into the mill proper. Graves carried the only key to the office door. McDonald, a workman in the mill, carried the-only key to the River street mill door, and Smith, another workman, carried the only key to the double doors opening on Mill street. The wooden panels of the Mill street double doors extended about 3 1-2 feet from the floor, above which the doors are made of sash and glass. There were six panes of glass in each door 10 by 15 inches. The doors were old and somewhat shrunken. There was a lock screwed on the inside surface of one of these double doors, the bolt from which slid into an iron catch screwed on the inside surface of one of these double doors, the bolt from which slid into an iron catch screwed on the inner surface of the other half of the door. There was also a staple at the bottom of these doors where they came together which sprang into a mortice in the floor. This bolt projected about 6 inches above the the floor, the top being turned over, forming a kind of ring on the end. There was a corresponding bolt on the top of the doors that sprang into a mortice on the frame above the doors. .From this upper bolt a wire about 18 inches long was suspended, with a ring on the end for the purpose of unloosing it. Sometime before December 9 the lower pane of glass in one of the doors and directly on a line with these bolts was broken out and a piece of cardboard or flour-sack was nailed over the hole on the inside and remained there till the time in question. The ring from the upper bolt could be reached from the outside through this«hole in the window; but the lower one could not be without some instrument to pull it up, as the top of the lower bolt was 3 feet below the spring in the door. The defendant worked for Graves a short time in the mill, about a <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>year before this. The week in question defendant worked about a day and a half for Graves in the mill the middle of the week. He came there again on Saturday and worked during the afternoon. He was paid off at 6 o’clock and left. Before he left Graves informed him he didn’t want him any longer. Graves and McDonald were the last ones to leave the mill on Saturday night, December 8. They left the mill about 9 P. M. When they left the River street door was locked and the Mill street double doors were locked and bolted, and the cardboard or sack nailed over the hole in the door. They left the mill lantern out in the middle of the mill about 30 feet from the office. They locked the safe and money drawer and opened the blinds and ran up the shades to the office windows, and as they left locked the outside office door.</p>

In company 'with Armstrong, a bank watchman, he entered the mill through this door and found the defendant in the office. On inquiry from the policeman as to what he was doing there' defendant answered he was working for Graves and had a right there. The officers did not make a thorough examination of the mill at the time. Armstrong left, leaving "Van Wormer and defendant in the mill, and went up to Streeter corner. On examining the Mill street double doors it was found that the cardboard or paper sack had been torn off from the place where the pane -of glass was gone. The bolts at top and bottom had been drawn out of the mortices and the doors thus pressed open, the bolt not having been turned back with a key but still protruding from the lock. On inquiry from Van Wormer as to where the bey was to this door defendant answered that he carried it. He pretended to look for it, but not finding any key they sprung the doors together, the defendant then found an old bey that had the ring on the end broken off and with a pair of .pinchers unlocked the River street door and Van Wormer left through that door, leaving defendant in the mill. Van Wormer then met Armstrong at the Streeter corner and together they went to the residence of Graves. They returned to the mill with Graves <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>in about half an hour and found the defendant was gone. On examination they found that the Eiver street door he let Yan Wormer out of was closed but not locked. They found the mill lantern in the office, the stove hearth lay on the office floor and strips of partially burned paper were scattered around the floor. The blinds to the office windows were all closed and the shades down. The dial on the safe and knob that turned the combination was bruised and battered up. An expert had to be employed to drill into the safe, and on opening it, it was found that the knob had been pulled out about one quarter of an inch by some instrument which had been used as a pry so as to displace the tumblers The cuts or bruises on the dial were one-sixteenth of an inch deep. There was a piece of brass nailed over the money drawer where the bolt enters the catch or mortice, and this was found pounded up and bent nearly double. A warrant was procured at once for defendant’s arrest, and he was arrested at his mother’s house about 8 o’clock in the morning. He was found concealed behind a door. When informed of his arrest he said he expected they would be after him. Further facts as to defendant’s arrest appear in the opinion.</p>

It appeared that defendant was around with his brother playing billiards and pool till about 11 o’clock Saturday night. He and his brother both resided with their mother. The brother started for home about 11 o’clock and left the defendant on a street corner. About that time the defendant was seen by a policeman, who testifies that while he had been drinking he could walk perfectly straight. The officers who found him in the mill testified that he was not intoxicated ; that while he had been drinking some he could talk and get around as well as anyone. Defendant testified that he did not know how he came in the mill; that the officers woke him up ; that he did not know that he did anything wrong; that he was not conscious that the safe had been touched : that he did not enter the mill with the intent of doing any wrong. He had never been arrested before or accused of any crime.</p>
