Y. </em>321</a>, and cases there cited, holding that a violation of the provisions of said act was a misdemeanor and punishable as such. See Foote <em>v. </em>People, <a href="/ny/56/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="56 N.Y. 321" data-case-ids="519293" data-case-paths="/ny/56/0321-01">56 <em>N. Y. </em>321</a>. Sections 25 and 26 provided for the revocation of a license upon conviction or judgment, - for any violation of the provisions of this act, cither in a suit upon a penalty or a suit upon a bond, but such revocation could not be had until the conviction had been transmitted to the next Court of Sessions, and the licensee had been summoned before the court to show cause why said license should not be revoked, and an opportunity afforded him to have his day in court. By section 8 of <em>L. </em>1873, cli. 540, above cited, the class of convictions was extended to all or any conviction for a violation of the provisions of the act, and that such conviction shall forfeit and annul such license, and then the section goes on and provides a remedy by which such revocation can be had. It relegates to the power that grants the license the power to revoke the same, which it did not have before. It affords the licensee an opportunity to be heard—to have his day in court—which under the construction contended for by the People the licensee could never have. This provision does precisely what was provided for by sections 25 and 26 of Act of 1857 (2 <em>Edmonds’ Rev. Stat. </em>§§ 5-20).", An analogous case is the section which declares a second marriage <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>during the lifetime of a former husband <em>or </em>wife, except in certain cases, to be absolutely void, yet in the next chapter provision is made by which the chancellor may declare said second marriage void. The legislature provided the remedy prescribed, in order that a person should not be deprived of a fair and impartial hearing—a'day in court, which he otherwise would not have. Will this court hold that a conviction of one Herman Jacob for violation of the excise law, viz., selling liquor on Sunday on appellant's premises, is sufficient of itself to revoke and annul appellant’s license without proof before some tribunal appointed and designated by law, that said Jacob was an employee of appellant, and that the sale was made by the consent of appellant, or that appellant was present or connived at, or participated in such sale. Such a construction would deprive appellant of his right of trial, and leave him without a remedy. It is submitted that all that section 8 implies is that such conviction shall forfeit and annul appellant’s license upon its appearing, satisfactorily to the Board of Excise, upon an examination thereof, and the proof offered, after the licensee has been duly notified to appear and show cause why said license should not be revoked, that a violation of the provisions of the act has been made by the licensee, and then said license shall be forfeited and annulled by said board, and the licensee deprived of all benefits thereof.</p>

The case is far different. The licensee in that ease had an opportunity to be heard upon his trial for such a violation ; was a party, and was found g-uilty by a court of competent jurisdiction. Much stronger evidence is required to show, as in the present case, that the licensee knew, assented to, participated in or connived at such sale, whereas, in the case of the bar-keeper, simple proof of the sale by him upon the premises on Sunday is sufficient to secure his conviction.

The subsequent clause of the section provides for the annulment of the license by the Board of Excise upon proceedings instituted upon its own motion or upon complaint of a resident. This jurisdiction does not depend upon the facts of a prior conviction under the act. It is an independent remedy for the annulment of the license by the Board of Excise whenever it becomes satisfied upon inquiry, after notice that the licensee has violated the act. It supplements the provision in the prior clause and operates as an additional restraint and gives a remedy for the revocation of a license although no criminal prosecution has been instituted. It is not necessary to consider sections 25 and 26 of the Act of 1857. These sections provide for the revocation of a license after a conviction or judgment has been obtained against a licensee for a penalty given by the act or upon his bond.
