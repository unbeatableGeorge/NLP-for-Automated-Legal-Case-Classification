The learned judge should, as requested, have withdrawn the question of murder in the first degree from the consideration <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>of the jury. His instructions upon the law of the two degrees of murder were entirely accurate. But he failed to apply the facts to his definitions, and consequently the jury fell into the quite natural error of treating the many brutal and atrocious features of this homicide as the equivalant of legal evidence of deliberation. We find enough to warrant the submission to the jury of the question of murder in the second degree ; that is, of killing with the design to effect the death of Keenan or of some other person, but without deliberation and premeditation. Enough, too, if the indictment had been framed under the second subdivision of section 183, and had charged the killing by an act imminently dangerous to others, and evincing a depraved mind regardless of human life, although without premeditation, to have justified the submission of murder in the first degree. But for the evidence of deliberation', we have sought in vain. Upon the contrary, the strongest testimony against Conroy points no farther than to sudden impulse. Between the impulse and the act there was no reflection, however slight or brief. There were, in fact, none of the <em>indicia </em>of deliberate purpose ; no hesitation, no doubt overcome, no choice made as the result of thought. Indeed, the gravest question was, whether the shot was fired with any distinct and specific intent, or merely with a reckless and wanton disregard of human life.</p>

If voluntary intoxication may be considered upon the question of intent, <em>a fortiori </em>upon that of deliberation. The defense of insanity in our judgment entirely failed and was properly overruled by the jury. Undoubtedly Conroy was responsible "for his acts in every legal sense. But the evidence upon that head, while failing to establish irresponsibility, indicated an abnormal sensitiveness to liquor, resulting from sunstroke, a fall from a loft and other incidents, fully accounting for the extraordinary mental disturbance caused by two glasses of bar-room sherry. An exhibition of violence followed each dram, and followed it almost instantly. Nothing of the kind preceded the drinking. Cer<a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>tainly Conroy had no homicidal intent when he entered Cody’s saloon. That event was purely casual. He happened to be passing, and he was invited in to drink. He then seemed to be sober. The people within were either his friends, ordinary acquaintances, or persons with whom he was entirely unacquainted. At all events, he found no enemy there. After taking á glass of what was called sherry wine, he became quarrelsome, accused a man named Cantwell of having previously betrayed his improper presence in a drinking saloon while on duty, and upon Contwell’s retorting, offered to fight. In a few moments, he seemed to get entirely over this combative spirit,' became, as one of the witnesses described it “ happy,” and invited all present to drink at his expense. Again he took a glass of the so-called sherry wine, again he became quarrelsome. At first he questioned the price of the drinks. Then Cody, to pacify him, reduced the charge from one dollar to seventy cents. Still he seemed dissatisfied, inquiring of several about him if they had drunk. .He then asked a man named McGuinness what he had taken, and upon McGuinness replying “mixed ale,” Conroy called him a liar. McGuinness retorted, “ .You are another,” and thereupon Conroy struck him with his fist, knocking him down ; and while McGuinness was down kicked-him about the hips. This raised a tumult. The crowd <em>“ </em>hallooed ” . at Conroy to let McGuinness up, and began to close in around him. Conroy then drew his club, and the crowd retreated to a card-room in the rear. As they retreated Conroy also drew his revolver, holding the club in one hand, the revolver in the other.' Some one then put his head out of the card-room door and Conroy threw his club at him, missing the man’s head, but smashing a pane of glass in the door. Almost immediately another pane of glass was broken from the inside of the card-room. This evidently startled Conroy and precipitated the firing, for instantly he “ wheeled to his left ” with his face still towards the card-room door, and as a friend (Keating), who undoubtedly perceived that' danger was imminent, grasped him by the shoulder, the revolver, to use the language of the witness Buckley, “ at that instant went off.”</p>

The extreme rapidity of Conroy’s movements, the absence of threats, pre-existing ill-will or motive; the presence of self-aroused passion and sudden violence; the inappreciable space of time between the act and the earliest previous moment when it is possible to assume the flash of design ; the unreasoning, senseless and frenzied condition of his mind ; all tend absolutely to exclude the idea of deliberation, even within the most extreme construction which, in the interests of society, has been or can be given to this word in its present statutory relation.</p>

Conroy’s case, therefore, comes clearly with the second and not within the first of these degrees. But the error below was not unnatural. For if ever there was a case where the judgment of a right-minded court, prosecuting officer or jury might readily be obscured by a feeling of just indignation, it is assuredly the present. The tendency of its horrible detail is to make the citizen deplore the alteration in the law. It cries aloud for a judicial view of deliberation from which, under other and less aggravated circumstances, the mind would instantly revolt. The fact that the prisoner was a police officer, employed to protect the people from violence and to guard them from outrage, cannot but intensify this sentiment. Beyond question, Conroy richly deserves all the punishment which can lawfully be inflicted upon him. Less than this would be a miscarriage of justice.

If past constructions disarm the word “ deliberate” of any portion of the normal significance, they do not, of course, impair the just sense of the word <em>“ </em>premeditated,” which is new to the statute ; and the conjunction of the two words, in a form which requires the satisfaction of both, especially when accompanied with the creation of a new degree of the crime of murder, which itself requires the presence of an actual and established intent to kill, leaves no door open to doubt that murder in the first degree can now only be shown by proof of some amount or kind of deliberation and premeditation antecedent to the act or blow which intentionally effects the death, and of which the intent alone is not adequate evidence. The intent or design is, of course, necessary in both degrees. It alone is sufficient in the second ; but in the first it must have the characterization of deliberate and premeditated design. There are many modes in which this characterization may be shown ; as, for instance, by procuring and administering poison, by lying in wait, by arming or preparing for the deed in advance, by <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>seeking an opportunity or advantage, by threats of revenge oi hate, or,, in short, any form of words or action which indicates thought and conclusion of a considered purpose to effect a design. My brother Baeeett lias shown how dearly the cases cited by the counsel for the people fall within this rule. It is not necessary to repeat what is so well said.</p>
    <p id="b280-4" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[369,686,1166,781]]]'>In the case at bar I am unable to find any evidence to justify a finding of deliberate and premeditated design to effect the death of the person killed, or of any other person. The prisoner was a policeman, but the law of murder for him is no different for that reason. He was charged with duties and trusts which made misconduct a crime on his part peculiarly odious ; but that fact, while it may expose him to the dangers of popular prejudice, and in a sense excuse clamorous condemnation, cannot in law change or affect his guilt or innocence of murder in the first degree. He is not on trial for violation of official duty, but for a felony affecting his life, and in its definition of that crime and its requirements of proof to establish it, the law knows no scale of adjustment that fits a brutal policeman but does not fit other brutal criminals. The Legislature has not so provided ; and that is an answer to every suggestion of undue severity because of official position.</p>

He went for the purpose of drinking on <em>“ </em>the treat ” of a candidate for office. He drank what is called sherry, and it is not difficult to imagine what sort of vile concoction bore that name in that place. The evidence shows that he was peculiarly susceptible to the effects of drink, and he speedily showed its effects upon him. A colloquy and controversy sprung up between him and another, which led, on his part, "to an offer to fight any person present for money—but this passed over, and the prisoner invited every person present to drink. They all drank, a dozen or fifteen in number. The prisoner again drank sherry; when he asked what he had to pay he was told a dollar. The price angered him, and he asked who bad drank. Cody told him all, but the prisoner disputed, and turned to one person, asked what he had drank; he answered, “ mixed ale.” The prisoner <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>called him a liar, and the lie was given back to him. That party approached the prisoner, who immediately struck him and knocked Mm down, and commenced kicking him while down. At this several persons demanded that he let the person up, and all gathered around the prisoner. The party knocked down got up and immediately fled from the saloon. The prisoner, as soon as freed from those holding him, drew his policeman’s club, and went toward the “ crowd,” some of whom retreated into the “card-room,” and shut the door ; the prisoner went toward the card-room, and struck with his club, breaking a light of glass in the door; immediately a light was broken from the other side; the prisoner stepped back and drew his revolver and cocked it, and although seized by one person present, who said, “ Don’t shoot, Billy ; those are my friends,” he turned partly around and fired in the direction of three persons standing near each other, and hit the deceased, with whom he had had no controversy, in the abdomen and inflicted a wound from which he afterwards died. The deceased exclaimed that he was “ done for ” and fell over—but no one seemed to think at that time that the bullet had\ taken effect. This is the substance of all that took place up to the time of the shooting. It is impossible, I think, to see in it any “deliberate and premeditated design” to effect the death of any person. There was nothing of deliberation or premeditation in the affair. The madness of drink operating upon a brain and system physically and morally weak and wicked, perhaps was there, and very likely a drunken and reckless intent to kill, quite sufficient to justify a conviction of murder in the second degree; but it seems to be in vain to look for evidence of deliberate and premeditated murder.</p>

The officers examined the deceased and did not discover that he was shot. One proposed to send for an ambulance. The prisoner exclaimed “ ambulance-, be d.—d,the^ man- is, not shot,” and he gave into their custody two young men whom he charged with, dis<a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>orderly conduct, and lie himself dragged out the deceased to take him to the police station. On the way he beat him brutally with his club, but those injuries are shown to have had no effect in causing his death. At the station he stated that he had arrested the deceased for drunkenness and disorderly conduct; that he was assaulted by a mob and his prisoner was recovered and that he shot the prisoner to prevent his escape, and afterwards when he was told the prisoner was really shot, he said in substance he ought to be for he “ tried hard enough to shoot him.”</p>

There had been no mob—no rescue, or attempt at rescue, and no shooting on such an occasion. This was all a falsehood invented as an excuse for his misconduct as an officer, and the statement that he tried hard to shoot the deceased was not intended'to be anything more than an assertion that he tried hard to do his duty as against a mob of rescuers and an escaping prisoner. It is not to be detached from its context and distorted into an admission that he tried hard to shoot the deceased, while he sat quietly on a whiskey cask in Cody’s saloon at the time he was wounded. To do so is to make the prisoner’s false declaration that something took place that would justify a shooting, a confession of something in conflict with the testimony of every witness on the part of the people,</p>

Those who remained in the saloon were the proprietor, Cody, his wife, Cantwell, Keating and the deceased. The appellant approached the door mentioned, and observing that one of the persons who had retreated was exposing his head, doubtless to ascertain where the appellant was, struck at the head but missed it and broke some of the glass. He then backed from the door and as he did so put his club in his belt and deliberately drew his revolver, which he had some trouble in taking from his pocket. Keating seeing this said to him, “ For God’s sake, Billy, don’t fire; those are friends of mine.” The appellant paid no attention to this-request, but turned towards where the deceased was standing with others, raised his revolver and fired the fatal shot. He" attempted another shot, but was stopped by Keating and Buck,, ley.
