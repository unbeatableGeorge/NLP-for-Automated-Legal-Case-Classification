It was strongly urged upon the argument in behalf of McDonald that the resolution of the senate does not contemplate any legislative action whatever, but only and solely an investigation as to the guilt of the commissioner of the charges which are recited in the resolution. The adoption of this view, however, as it imputes to the senate an assumption of power, is forbidden by the respect for that high and dignified body which should be cherished and observed by every judge. It will be assumed therefore that the inquiry which the resolution authorized was to be conducted for a legitimate and proper purpose, and that when the senate directed its committee “ to report the result of such investigation, and its <em>recommendations </em>concerning the same,” it intended thereby that such committee should report what legislation was, in its judgment, required to remedy evils or abuses, if any such were found.</p>

The discussion and consideration should be conducted with a sincere respect for that body in which, together with the assembly, by the constitution of the state, it is declared, <em>“ </em>the legislative power of this state shall be vested,” and with an honest desire to preserve to it all its rights and privileges, but yet with a determination also to preserve to each great department of the government of the state the power lodged by the constitution therein, the preservation of which to each is vital to the liberties and rights of the people of this commonwealth. -</p>

The resolution recites that he had “ been <em>declared </em>to be <em>guilty </em>of a contempt of the senate,” and was “ <em>convicted </em>thereof.” It then states the particular contempt of which he was “ <em>declared . </em>. . guilty,” and of which he had been <em>“ </em>convicted,” and then proceeds to announce the <em>punishment </em>to be imprisonment, as hereinbefore stated, and which is preceded by the words “ is hereby sentenced.” The language of the president of the senate in communicating to McDonald the determination of that body is also equally sig<a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>nificant, as to the character of the power it claimed to exercise. He said, after stating the offense of which McDonald had been adjudged guilty: “ It becomes my duty to communicate to you, at this time, <em>th&amp; judgment </em>or <em>punishment </em>the senate has seen fit to impose upon you for the <em>offense </em>which you have committed.” This declaration is followed by an enunciation of “ the judgment or sentence ” imposed by the senate.</p>
    <p id="b113-4" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[162,731,1157,1414]]]'>From the foregoing statements of facts, it is apparent that the senate "summoned McDonald to answer for an <em>offense ; </em>that after a hearing or trial upon which he was represented by counsel, it declared him “ to be guilty ” and <em>“ </em>convicted” him “ thereof,” and then “ sentenced ” him to “ the judgment or punishment ” of imprisonment in the county jail of Albany county, where he is now detained, and where he must continue, unless relieved by this proceeding, “ until the final adjournment of the present legislature, unless sooner discharged by order of the senate.” It needs no elaborate argument to prove that this was the exercise of <em>judicial </em>and not of <em>legislative </em>power. This conclusion follows inevitably from the conceded truth that while it 'is the prerogative of the legislature, as a general rule, only to enact laws, and thus to declare what acts shall be deemed criminal, subject, however, to the restraints of the fundamental law, it is also, as a general rule, the prerogative of courts alone to interpret the laws, and to apply and enforce their remedies, either as between individuals or as between the state and parties subject thereto. There is, however, no occasion for abstract reasoning upon this point, as in the recent case of Kilbourn <em>v. </em>Thompson (<a href="/us/103/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="103 U.S. 168" data-case-ids="1522273" data-case-paths="/us/103/0168-01">103 <em>U.

It is true that there are statutory enactments in this state (1 <em>Edm. R. S. </em>153, sec. 13, sub. 4), which undertake to confer upon “ each house . . . the power to punish as a contempt, and by imprisonment, a breach of its privileges, or of the privileges of its members ” in certain specified cases, among which are, “ that of refusing to attend, or be examined as a witness, either before the house or a committee, or before any person authorized by the house, or by a committee, to take testimony in legislative proceedings.” It is also true that this enactment can have force by limiting its provisions to those cases, in which by the constitution of the state either house has judicial powers (some of which have been previously mentioned), but it cannot be denied that relying upon the case of Anderson <em>v. </em>Dunn (6 Wheaton, 204), and which they refer to in their notes (3 <em>R. S. </em>[2d ed.] 456), the revisers of our statutes supposed that the power to punish for contempts existed in both branches of the legislature. The authority relied upon, however, which does hold that either house of Congress has, by virtue of its <em>legislative </em>power, <em>general </em>authority to punish for contempt, is distinctly overruled in the more recent case by the same tribunal (the Supreme Court of the United States) in Kilbourn <em>v. </em>Thompson (<a href="/us/103/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="103 U.S. 168" data-case-ids="1522273" data-case-paths="/us/103/0168-01">103 <em>U.

Such is not the doctrine, however, of the English courts to-day.” The learned judge then refers to the English cases (103 U.

Or to put the question more fully and accurately, it being conceded that the alleged contempt for which McDonald is imprisoned was committed, if at all, not in the course of a <em>judicial </em>inquiry, which the senate, by the constitution was authorized to make, but in the course of a <em>legislative </em>inquiry instituted with a view to possible legislation, how could a mere statute confer upon it the power which it has exercised <em>% </em>We are thus brought (as it is cited to uphold McDonnell’s imprisonment) to the discussion of the constitutionality of a statute of the state, an inquiry, certainly of the gravest character, but one which courts must consider and decide, when arising in the due course of a judicial proceeding.</p>

They all undoubtedly had their origin in the practice of the English parliament, which the case of Anderson <em>v. </em>Dunn, 6 <em>Wheaton, </em>204, held to be applicable to both houses of congress. The resolution under which the inquiry of the committee of the house of representatives in the Kilbourn case was conducted, recited that the United States was a creditor of the bankrupt firm of Jay Cooke &amp; Co., and became such “from the improvident deposits made by the secretary of the navy of the United States, with the London branch of said house of Jay Cooke &amp; Co., of the public moneys that the house of Jay Cooke <em>&amp; </em>Co. were largely interested in a real estate pool in the city of Washington, of their interest in which a settlement, disastrous to their estate and to its creditors, had been made by their <em>trustee; </em>and <em>that, </em>therefore, the affairs of such pool and the matters of such settlement should be inquired into by a special committee of the house, to be appointed by its speaker, “ with power to send for persons and papers and <em>report </em>to this house.” Of such a resolution, as it involved an inquiry into .a transaction in which the general government, as well as private individuals, was interested, it might well have been said that under it legislation was contemplated to prevent in the future “ improvident deposits ” by an official of the United States with an individual banking house, and to prevent fraudulent settlements thereafter by trustees of the estates of adjudged bankrupts, and that, therefore, the inquiry was within the power of the house; and yet, after Kilbourn had declined to answer questions propounded by the committee touching the pool it was required to investigate, and had refused to produce its records, and for such refusal the house had adjudged him to be in contempt, and had imprisoned him therefor, in an action brought for the imprisonment, the court held that the inquiry was beyond the jurisdiction of the liouse and the imprisonment illegal and contrai’y to law. Can that case be distinguished from the present ? It is, undoubtedly, very similar. The argument founded upon the necessity'of an investigation to formulate legislation is as forcible in the one <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>case as in the other, and if in the one case such argument was not sufficiently potent to justify the imprisonment, it is not seen why it should be in the other. True it is that the decision referred to was directly predicated upon the power of congress, and not upon that of a state legislature, but of the subject-matter of the inquiry the house of representatives had as full and complete jurisdiction in the matter of Kilbourn as the senate of this state had in that of McDonald. In both cases the intent to legislate was evinced, if there was any such intent in either, by the direction to the committee <em>“ </em>to reportin both the private affairs of the citizen were sought to be discovered; and until now the right of investigation by congress and the state legislature has been placed, both by elementary writers and in judicial opinions, upon a common ground, as an incident to the law-making power. ' The most exalted tribunal of the land having deliberately held that such power as has been assumed by the senate in the present case (which is believed to be the logical sequence from the decision in the Kilbourn case)', it is difficult to see how the imprisonment of McDonald can be sustained either on authority or reason.</p>

The argument, in brief, is this : The power is a necessary one to enable a legislative body to enact laws, and because necessary, though unconferred, it exists. The force of the old maxim, “ <em>Quando lex aliquid concedit, concederé videtur et illud, sine quo res ipsa esse non </em>potest,” is conceded as a general rule; but it would be difficult to prove that such a power is <em>indispensable </em>in the enactment of laws, and that legislators can only intelligently legislate in regard to crime and official delinquencies when they <em>have precise </em>information as to the crimes committed by particular individuals, and the delinquencies of particular officials. The truth in no such <em>exact </em>accuracy of knowledge has ever been acquired, either through investigation by examination of witnesses or without it, and the existence of our state government <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>to-day, and our body of wise and wholesome statutes disprove the theory upon which the argument rests. It is not supposed in the present case that there was any intention impertinently to pry into the private affairs of a citizen, nor is there discoverable in the examination of McDonald any attempt to extort evidence which was not legitimate to the inquiry, provided the inquiry itself was legitimate and authorized by law. If the commissioner of public works of the city of Hew York had committed frauds, or if it was supposed he had, the machinery of the law, controlled by courts, was adequate’to investigation and punishment. If the proper safeguards of integrity of official, conduct in such commissioner were not embodied in the law creating the office, an examination of those statutes would disclose the opportunities for official peculation, and reflection would suggest proper amendment. The truth is, that if the <em>“ mqy,isitorial power </em>” (this is the name given to it by the counsel for the senate) exists in a branch of the state legislature, the citizen can have no secret: all the details of his private business, the condition of his property and estate, any immoral conduct, any short-coming in thought, word or deed can be laid bare under the torture of imprisonment. Of course, good sense and honor will generally prevent such an abuse of power, but t'he statement of the ultimate conclusion is necessary before the concession is made of the existence, in are-publican state, of an unconferred power capable of such results. If such a power is inherent in the legislative department because its existence is necessary, why does it not, also, inherently reside in the executive ? The governor may, when called upon to act officially, and especially when making suggestions as to legislation, oftentimes need exact information. Why should he not enjoy the same prerogative under the plea of necessity ? The answer to the argument in both cases is, that, under republican governments the liberty of the citizen is secure, and the power which interferes with it must be conferred by the fundamental law. Extraordinary parliamentary prerogatives and privileges, by which the secrets of the citizen may be extorted and his liberties taken away, existing in a country where a parliament is supreme, and gives to the people whatever rights they possess, cannot exist in a country, the <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>government of which rests upon a precisely opposite theory, that the people confer all power, and that executives, legislatures and courts take only such authority as the people bestow. It was well said by Bronson, J., in Taylor <em>v. </em>Porter, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Hill%2C%20140" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="4 Hill, 140">4 <em>Hill, </em>140</a>-144: <em>“ </em>Under our form of government the legislature is not supreme. It is only one of the organs of that absolute sovereignty which resides in the whole body of the people. Like other departments of the government, it can only exercise such powers as have been delegated to it; and when it steps beyond that boundary, its acts, like those of the most humble magistrate in the state who transcends his jurisdiction, are utterly void.” To the argument, then, founded on necessity, the answer is clear. Its possession may be convenient, but is not indispensable; its capacity for abuse is enormous; it deals with the liberty of the citizen upon the theory of existing parliamentary privileges, which have never been conferred, and because unconferred, cannot be exercised under a government republican in form, which, to be such in fact, as well as in name, cannot commit persons within its jurisdiction to an “ Inquisitorial Power,” uncontrolled by law, the only restraint being the discretion of the body exercising it.</p>

A reference to that clause of the constitution will show that the whole body of the common law of England was not thereby introduced into this state, but only “ <em>such parts </em>of the common law, and of the acts of the legislature of the colony of New York, <em>as together did form the law of the colony </em>on the nineteenth day of April, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five . . . shall be and continue the law of this state.” The truth is, that the powers of the English parliament were not dependent upon the common law at all (see cases above cited), but upon the <em>lex et consuetudo parliament ; </em>and as early as 1604 the parliament called itself (1 <em>Hallam's Con. His. </em>254-5) “the high court of parliament,” and then added, “ whose power being above the law <em>is not founded on the common law, </em>but have their rights and privileges peculiar to themselves.” It will be observed that the constitution adopts only “ such parts of the <em>common law, </em>and of the <em>acts </em>of the legislature of the colony of New York, as together, did form the law of the colony ” on April 19, 1775, and no part of <em>th% parliamentary </em>law. It is necessary, therefore, to sustain the position taken by the counsel for the senate, to prove that the power claimed was either part of the <em>common law </em>of the colony, or was contained in an <em>act </em>of its legislature. As it was not a part of the common law of England, it is difficult to see how it could become a part of the common law of the colony; and as no act of the colony ever conferred it, it is equally difficult to see how the constitutional provision referred to aids the position assumed. The ninth article of the first' constitution of the state, adopted in 1777 (7th ed. <em>R. S. </em>39), did provide “that the <em>assembly . . . </em>shall choose their own speaker, be judges of their own members, <em>and enjoy the same privileges, </em>and proceed in doing business in like manner as the assemblies of the colony of New York formerly did;” but "this clause gave no power to the <em>senate, </em>and was omitted in the subsequent constitutions, and the provision now reads as has been set, forth above. It has already been shown that the constitution, as it now reads, does not give any color to the argument that it validates the power in either branch of the legislature, but it may be well to show that the colonial legislature had no such power in fact.</p>

It is unnecessary to dfetail the mode and manner of the government of the colony of New York while under English rule. It is sufficient to state that instead of the absolute power of parliament being conferred upon the colonial legislature, or upon the people themselves, its laws were subject to royal approval, and even the charter of liberties, passed on the 17th day of October, 1683, by the assembly of the colony, was vetoed.by James (the same duke of York) when he became king in 1686, and the act of 1691 shared the same fate under King William, <em>(Bancroft's History of the United States, </em>vol. 2, p. 414; vol. 3, p. 56 ; <em><a href="/citations/?q=4%20Hill%2C%20140" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 Hill, 140">Id.</a> </em>p. 101 ; 2 <em>R.

And of this high court, he adds, it may be truly said <em>‘si antiquiiatem speetes, est vetustissima • si </em>dignitatem, <em>est honoratissima; is firisdictionem, est capacissima? </em>It hath sovereign and uncontrolling authority in the making, confirming, enlarging, restraining, abrogating, repealing, reviving and expounding of laws concerning matters of all possible denominations, ecclesiastical or temporal, civil, military, maritime or criminal; this being the place where that absolute despotic power, which must in all governments reside somewhere, is intrusted by the constitution of these kingdoms. All mischiefs and grievances, operations and remedies, that transcend the ordinary course of the laws, are within the reach of this extraordinary tribunal. It can regulate or new model the succession to the crown, as was done in the reign of Henry VIII. and William III. It can alter the established religion of the land, as was done in a variety of instances, in the reign of King Henry VIII. and his three children. It can change and create afresh even the constitution of the kingdom and of parliaments themselves, as was done by the act of union, and the several statutes for triennial and septennial elections. It can, in short, do everything that is not naturally impossible, and, therefore, some have not scrupled to call its power, by a figure rather too bold, the omnipotence of parliament.” The same author (page 163) further observes : “ For as every court of justice hath laws and customs for its direction, some the civil and canon, some the common law, others their own peculiar laws and customs, so the high court of parliament hath also its own peculiar law, called the <em>lex et oonsuetudo parliament • </em>a law which, Sir Edward Coke observes, is <em>‘ah omnibus </em>quosrenda, <em>a multis </em>ignórala, <em>apaueis .cognita.’ </em>” Is it to be gravely argued that such supreme power, such extraordinary prerogatives, passed by <em>inheritance </em>to either a colonial or state legislature, both of which took only conferred, and not <em>inherited </em>authority ? If they did, then freedom found no asylum on American soil, and the founders of states unconsciously brought with them a tyranny, which, like their shadows, followed them across the Atlantic, and descended, like the mantle of the prophet, upon the shoulders of the body they created, in the vain hope that <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>well-defined and circumscribed power, and not omnipotence; had been by them bestowed. If it be urged that, by inheritance, legislatures took only a few of these parliamentary prerogatives, of which their right to summon all citizens before it or its committees, and to extract from their unwilling breasts all secrets by the power of imprisonment, was one, it is answered that heirs, in the absence of a testamentary disposition, take the ancestor’s whole estate, and the argument founded upon an alleged inheritance must be abandoned, because it proves too much. But if a partial inheritance is consistent with the argument based upon an alleged heirship, and it be urged that only such powers as were consistent with the changed order of things were taken, then it is insisted that this particular power, so potent for mischief, and aptly termed “ inquisitorial,” could not descend by inheritance to the legislature of either a colony or a republican state. It is inconsistent with the framework of both, and the conceded fact that both took only <em>conferred </em>power, and not any by <em>inheritance, </em>is a sufficient answer to the suggested argument.</p>

They have so decided, after full and exhaustive argument, when presided over by judges, whose names and character are world-wide famous, and such decisions, in every judicial forum, should arrest discussion and dispel doubt.</p>

If McDonald had refused to answer questions in aid of an inquiry in which the senate was authorized to act judicially, then the power to commit would follow; and, to guard against any misapprehension, the general statement should be made, when the legislature or either branch thereof, is in the execution of <em>jxidicial </em>functions conferred by the conistitution, the power to commit for contempt cannot be doubted. When, howevér, the inquiry is for <em>legislative </em>purposes only, and such it was in the present instance, most careful examination and reflection lead the judge to whom this case has been submitted, to more than doubt the legal existence of the power which has been exercised over McDonald. This, however, is his individual conclusion, supported it is true by the decision in Kilbourn <em>v. </em>Thompson, and those recently made by the privy council in England, but which, though of very high authority, have not yet been adopted in this state. The judicial utterances in cases determined in this state (though in none, with the single exception of People <em>v. </em>Learned, was the direct question involved), are against the conclusions herein stated. The contrary rule was affirmed in Briggs <em>v. </em>Mackellar, 2 <em>Abb. Pr. R. </em>30, in Wickelhausen <em>v. </em>Willett, 10 <em>Abb. Pr. R. </em>164; and again in same case <em>sub nom. </em>Wilckens <em>v. </em>Willett, 1 Keyes, 521, 525, in the Court of Appeals. In the last mentioned case was involved the legality of the arrest of an individual for neglecting to appear before a committee of the house of representatives of the congress of the United States, as a witness, “ in a matter,” as the stipulation under which it was submitted admitted, “then pending and under investigation by said house, <em>and within its </em>

      <em>jurisdiction? </em>It is not, and could not, therefore, decide that the power to punish for contempt existed, when the refusal to testify was made in the course of an examination in aid of general legislation; but the existence of such a power is stated, both by Judge Hoffman in the Superior Court and Judge Johnson in the Court of Appeals, in the most unqualified language. Such utterances, however, were made long prior to the decision in Kilbourn <em>v. </em>Thompson, and if that had then been promulgated, they perhaps would never have been announced with the breadth which they now cover. Still they are in conformity with the <em>dicta </em>of other judges, scattered through the reports and the opinions of various elementary writers, and, therefore, as the practice of this state has been in conformity with such opinions for many years, should not be disregarded by a single judge in judicial action, even though his views may be widely different from theirs.</p>

A commission had .been created by joint resolution of the legislature <em>(Laws of </em>1875, 823) “ to investigate canal affairs,” and by an act (chap. 91 of <em>Laws of </em>1875) it was authorized “ to compel the attendance of witnesses.” One Henry D. Denison had refused to produce before such commission certain books and papers, and for such refusal had been committed to the common jail of Albany county. On <em>habeas corpus </em>Mr. Justice Learned had released him from imprisonment,'which decision was reversed by the General Term of the Supreme Court, Judge James writing the opinion, and Judge Boardman, concurring. It is true that the authority of this case is very much weakened by the fact (vol. 16 of <em>Albany Law Journal, </em>96) that when the case came before the Court of Appeals for review, the counsel, who had been successful at the General Term, <em>“ </em>asked the court not to review it, and stipulated not to enforce the determination, either against the person or the property of Denison,” and that thereupon the Court of Appeals refused to hear it, but, nevertheless, until reversed it must control this court as now organized. The opinion of Judge James cites no adjudged case, holding that <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>the power which the canal commission exercised was legally-conferred, nor is it sustained by any argument therein stated. The conclusion, however, that the decision of Mr. Justice Learned should be reversed, can only be justified upon the assumption that the legislature could confer judicial power upon the commission it' created, by which alone it could make its inquiry effective. It needs no argument to demonstrate that, if such power could be conferred upon a commission charged with the mere duty of investigation, it could also be conferred upon a committee of either house of the legislature. If that decision is the law of this state, then the imprisonment of McDonald is abundantly justified, and certainly, until reversed, it is the law governing the action, if not the opinion, of every judge within the department where it was made, when sitting alone and holding a court inferior in dignity to that which announced it.</p>

This argument has also been carefully weighed, but the judge writing this opinion has been unable to reach the conclusion that it would be a wise exercise of power for him, when singly holding a court, to overturn the entire practice of the state. Judges and courts must be conservative and not rash in action. A decision of a single judge, contrary to the practice of years of his own state, contrary to an adjudged case in the tribunal which is his immediate superior, and contrary to the opinion of the higher branch of the legislature of' such state, in which are many lawyers of eminent ability, would not command respect and would only create alarm as an abuse of power. The effect of the decision in Kilbourn <em>v. </em>Thompson, and those by the privy council in England upon the legislative practice of this state, must be determined by a higher tribunal than the one which now deals with the present case. If its decision shall be in conformity with the views expressed in this opinion, the relator will not be remediless; and if it shall be adverse to such views, then the. conclusion reached—that Mr. McDonald must be remanded to <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>the custody of the sheriff of Albany county, to be held by him under the senate’s warrant of commitment—will not interfere with the exercise of a power which the body exercising it claims to possess, and which it supposes it is wielding for the best interests of the state.</p>

The argument is that, by section 69 of such Code, if he unlawfully refused “ to answer any material and proper questions ” asked by the senate’s committee, he could be indietéd for a misdemeanor, and as his offense was thus punishable according to the provisions of such Code it was to be punished thereunder <em>“ </em>and not otherwise.”, § 719. This is specious, but not sound. The Penal Code prescribes and relates to the <em>“punishments </em>” to “ be inflicted only upon a legal conviction in a <em>court </em>having jurisdiction,” § 9; and the Code of Criminal Procedure prescribes <em>“ </em>the manner of prosecuting and convicting criminals.” § 8. The object of section 719 was to declare when the old penalties attached to crime, <em>on conviction after a prosecution in and before a competent </em>court, and when the new were applicable. After declaring that the provisions of the Code should have no retroactive effect, it explicitly states that “ an offense committed or other act done, at any time <em>before </em>the day when this Code takes effect . . . must be punished according to . . . the provisions of law existing when it was done or committedwhile one <em>“ </em>committed <em>after </em>the beginning of the day when this Code takes effect, must be punished according to the provisions of this Code, and not otherwise.” A general statute, as a rule, does not repeal a special one, and therefore a general code of laws relating to the penalties which <em>courts </em>must impose on <em>convictions </em>for crime according to the usual mode of procedure do not repeal special provisions to punish summarily for contempt. The words <em>“ </em>not otherwise ” in such section simply forbid courts, in punishing criminals for offenses to which the penalties of the Code are applicable, to do so “ otherwise ” than as such Code provides. It is unnecessary to pursue this point further. A comparison of the various sections with each other, and the language of the whole of section 719, <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>and not of a single paragraph read alone, make the meaning clear. If all power of the legislature to punish summarily for contempt is repealed, then all, which courts had, has also vanished; and if the latter had been swept away, as there was no punishment by the court summarily for contempt, it was useless to declare, as has been by section 680, that an act “ punishable as a contempt of court ” was also “ punishable as a crime.” This recognizes that the provisions as to court contempts are not repealed by the Penal Code ; and if those are not, then legislative con-tempts are not, for both are punishable under such Code as misdemeanors.</p>
    <p id="b132-4" data-blocks='[["BL_132.4",132,[360,916,1152,387]]]'>It remains only to be said that to a higher court than the present, the very grave questions involved in the present proceeding are committed, in the hope, however, that the views expressed in this opinion will, even though not adopted, aid in arriving at a sound and judicious conclusion thereon. If the labor and thought which have been given to the subject shall, in any way, assist the tribunal of review, he, who has given to it much of both, will be fully compensated.</p>
