Such a person is clearly incompetent to sit as a juror. It would be grossly unfair and unjust, and against all the traditions of our race, to compel any person to go to trial before a juror in such a frame of mind.

It is impossible to say upon their evidence that they were impartial jurors who could fairly sit in judgment upon the defendant. When persons called to sit as jurors are otherwise incompetent from actual bias, they must be required to make the declaration specified in the section -of the Code quoted. They need not make those declarations literally, but they must make them in substance; that is an absolute prerequisite ; and then if there is nothing in their further examination materially impeaching such declarations, the court may receive them as jurors, if satisfied that their opinions and impressions will not influence their verdict. These jurors did not literally nor in substance make the declarations required, and hence it was the duty of the court to hold them incompetent for actual bias’.</p>

It is however admitted in the record that before the jury was fully empaneled the defendant had exhausted all the peremptory challenges allowed him by law. He was therefore, by the erronous rulings of the trial judge, in holding these persons to be competent jurors, obliged to use his peremptory challenges, and was thus deprived of the right and power to use other peremptory challenges, in case he desired to. If after the plaintiff had used as many peremptory challenges as. he desired, he had not yet exhausted all his challenges, it could well be said that he had not been harmed. But where, by the erroneous rulings of the court, a defendant is obliged to exhaust his peremptory challenges, it is clear that he is harmed, that his rights are abridged, and that he has just cause to complain.</p>

Under such circumstances it can be seen that the defendant’s right to challenge peremptorily, was of great value to him, and it cannot be said that rulings of the court which abridged that right were not harmful.</p>
    <p id="b226-4" data-blocks='[["BL_226.4",226,[333,821,1160,828]]]'>In the case of Burt <em>v. </em>Panjaud (<a href="/us/99/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="99 U.S. 180" data-case-ids="3373040" data-case-paths="/us/99/0180-01">99 <em>U. S. </em>180</a>) it was held that an error committed in overruling an objection to a juror as legally disqualified, is cured, where it appears affirmatively that he was not a member of the panel which tried the case, and it does not appear that by his exclusion therefrom the party’s right of challenge was abridged. Hilleb, J., writing the opinion of the court, said : “We are of opinion that since Holmes did not sit on the jury, no harm was done to defendant. The object of both motions was to exclude him as one incompetent to sit. It is immaterial to the defendant how this was brought about. It is possible that if defendant' had shown affirmatively that he was excluded by reason of his peremptory challenge, and that in doing so the exercise of his right of peremptory challenge had been abridged, the result might be otherwise. It is sufficient to say that the record does not show that he was on the jury, but in fact that he was not, or that in getting rid of him any right of defendant was abridged or lost.</p>

Dowd was also called as a juror, and upon his examination he testified that he had heard and read about the case, and this question was pnt to him, “ ¡Notwithstanding what you have heard and read about it, could you sit as a juror and determine this case upon the evidence?” and he answered, “ Well, I should of course.” Upon his cross examination he testified that he had read about the case in the newspapers, and that it had made an impression upon him which still remained ; that he would bring that impression into the jury box, and that he thought it would require evidence to remove it, that he had expressed the opinion that the defendant was guilty of murder, and that he still had that opinion. The court sustained the competency of this juror, and he was sworn and served as a <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>juror. We are of opinion that this juror was not competent. Ee was not asked to and did not declare on oath that his opinion or impression would not influence his verdict, and that he could render an impartial verdict according to the evidence, or that he could weigh the evidence impartially. Ee did not so declare in words or in substance. Unless he did so declare and could so declare, he was incompetent, and, in the absence of such a declaration he should have been excluded. • It is not sufficient for a juror simply to declare that he supposes he can determine the case according to the evidence, or that he would go according .to the evidence, or that his opinion as to the defendant’s guilt ought not to influence his verdict, or that he supposes that he would have to go according to the witnesses. The defendant has the right to have the conscience and mind of the juror tested by a declaration under oath, not simply that he will be governed by the evidence, but by declarations which show that he believes he is in such a state of mind, so free from bias and prejudice, that he can weigh the evidence impartially, uninfluenced by any opinion or impression which he has formed. As said in <em>Bacons Abridgment </em>(Juries E, 5), “An honest but weak man may be so much biased as to think he goes by the evidence when his affections add weight to the evidence.” Indifferency is one of the common-law characteristics of a jury, and it is inviolably secured by the constitutional guaranty of jury trial. A party put upon trial for a crime has a constitutional right by a challenge, or in some other mode to protect himself against a biased jury.</p>
