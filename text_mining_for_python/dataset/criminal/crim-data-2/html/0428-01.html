The claim made by the relator’s counsel for Ms discharge from imprisonment is put upon the ground that the crime of assault in the third degree is punishable as a misdemeanor by imprisonment in a penitentiary or county jail, or by fine or both, under section 15 of the Penal Code ; not by imprisonment in a State prison— hence, that the sentence in this case to imprisonment in the State prison was and is without authority of law, and void. I am entirely of the opinion that the offense of assault in the third degree is but a misdemeanor; and punishable only as such. Whether a crime is a misdemeanor or a felony, is determinable by the grade of punishment authorized by law to be inflicted. Now a misdemeanor is declared to be punishable by imprison<a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>ment in a penitentiary or county jail “ for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than $500, or both ” <em>(Penal Code </em>§ 15, and section 222, <em><a href="/us/85/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="18 Wall. 163" data-case-ids="3426585" data-case-paths="/us/85/0163-01">Id.,</a> </em>which provides that assault in the third degree is punishable by imprisonment <em>“ </em>for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than $500, or by both).” Thus the punishment for assault in the third degree is identical with that provided for the punishment of misdemeanors. It is therefore clear, as I think, that the relator could only be punished as for a misdemeanor, that is, by imprisonment in a penitentiary or county jail, or by fine, or both. The relator’s case comes very manifestly within the purview of section 15, above cited—indeed it is exactly within its terms.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b456-4" data-blocks='[["BL_456.4",456,[332,953,1167,1320]],["BL_457.1",457,[131,383,1156,1611]]]'>It is insisted by the district-attorney that his case is covered by the provisions of section 703 of the Penal Code, which declares that when a person is convicted of a crime for which the punishment inflicted by law is imprisonment <em>“for a term, of one year" </em>he may be sentenced to imprisonment in a State prison. But the relator’s case (assault in the third degree) calls for punishment for “ not more than one year ” (§ 222); not “ for a term of one year.” In the former case the term is for not more than one year, that is, one year or less ; in the latter, the term must be for one- year, and may be for a longer period. The sentence of the relator should have been pronounced under section 15, to imprisonment in a penitentiary or county jail, or by fine, or both. The sentence to the state prison was without the authority of law, and void. The court of Sessions might as well have sentenced him to imprisonment in a county house, asylum or hospital, as to imprisonment in the state prison, in so far as there is any warrant or authority for the sentence imposed. That the state prison is a place where persons convicted of crime may be by law imprisoned, does not change the legal aspect of the case, inasmuch as even criminals cannot be imprisoned there, save under lawful authority; that is, when convicted of a crime which by law authorizes their confinement in that place. I am of the opinion that the sentence in this case is simply void; that the case is the same as if no sentence had been pronounced. But it by no means follows from this conclusion that the relator is not rightfully in the custody of the sheriff ; that officer still holds him as <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>a convicted criminal. He holds him on valid charge and conviction of crime. This is shown by the record of conviction presented by the sheriff in his return to the writ. He holds him for legal sentence by the court of Sessions on due conviction of assault in the third degree. So the relator should be remanded into the custody of the sheriff, or rather, should be left in his custody to the end that he may have legal judgment passed upon him, and carried into effect. We should not remand him to the end that an illegal and void sentence may be made effectual in his case, but in order to have legal valid judgment pronounced and executed against him. How, can it be maintained that he should be discharged from custody and go free from punishment, as is claimed by his counsel, for the reason that the term of the court at which he was convicted has closed its session ? In the first place it may be answered that he has caused the delay, and himself created the present condition of the case by his own action. He cannot now gainsay the right of the court to proceed on the conviction when it shall next convene. But again, suppose instead of this proceeding by <em>habeas </em>corpus, an appeal had been taken to this court. The <em>sentence </em>would then have been reversed, and he would have been required to appear in the court of Sessions for rightful, lawful sentence there; that is, he would have been remanded to the custody of the sheriff, to the end that he might receive lawful sentence. He could not in that case be discharged, on the ground that the term of the court at which he was convicted had closed its session. So here his claim to a discharge on that ground cannot be allowed. The court of Sessions has still jurisdiction in the case to pass sentence. As before suggested, it stands the same as if no sentence had been pronounced. The county judge was, therefore, right in refusing his discharge, even if it be true that the refusal was put on wrong grounds.</p>

So in this case I have sought to determine the grounds of the relator’s detention; why he is held in the custody of the sheriff, and for what purpose he should remain in custody. He is found to be, as I think, in lawful custody, being a convicted criminal awaiting lawful sentence therefor. He should therefore be remanded, not discharged.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.4",458,[324,775,1161,869]]]'>The case would be quite different were the relator actually in state prison, and held there for punishment only, under the illegal and void sentence here pronounced.

But these questions we need not consider, inasmuch as we find the relator yet subject to the jurisdiction of the court of Sessions, —held in the county jail, by the proper officer as a convicted criminal, subject to legal sentence therefor, by that court. It follows from these conclusions that the county judge was right in remanding the prisoner to the custody of the sheriff, and his order to that effect should be affirmed, but it should be reversed as to that part which directs the execution of the sentence.</p>
