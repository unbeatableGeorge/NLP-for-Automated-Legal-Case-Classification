Before the jury was sworn or impaneled, the defendant, who, priorato the commencement of the term, had been committed to answer to any indictment that might be found against him thereat, filed in open court a written protest or objection, under oath, against the swearing, organization or recognition by the court of the persons summoned as grand jurors, or of any of them as a grand jury, on the ground that they were not drawn or summoned as required by law. The same facts in support of the objection were presented as in the Petrea case (<a href="/ny/92/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="92 N.Y. 128" data-case-ids="2190143" data-case-paths="/ny/92/0128-01">92 <em>N.

If the case permits this discrimination, the objection must prevail, otherwise the case is governed by our former decision. By section 238, a challenge to the panel or any of the grand jurors is prohibited, but the section authorizes the court in its discretion to discharge the panel for causes specified, and among others “ that the requisite number of ballots was-not drawn from the grand jury box of the county.” Section 239 authorizes a challenge to be interposed to an individual grand juror for certain specified causes. Taking the two sections together, it seems to be quite evident that section 238 was intended to confer upon the court a discretionary power to discharge the panel to be exercised upon its own volition, and in view of all the circumstances, while section 239 was intended to secure to an accused person, the right to purge the panel of one or more particular grand jurors who might be objectionable, for bias, or other specified cause.</p>

The objection interposed to .the panel in this case on behalf of the defendant was in the nature of a challenge to the array, and the right of a defendant to challenge the body of the grand jury because irregularly or defectively constituted, no longer exists, and we find no provision of law permitting a defendant to raise any objection to the grand jury, except an objection to individual jurors under section 239. We think the objection of the defendant to the grand jury was properly overruled. It may not be out of place, however, to express the opinion that the court, except for the fact that the grand jury which found-the indictment in this case, although selected and organized after the decision in the Petrea case was selected before the board of supervisors had an opportunity to prepare a grand jury list in conformity with the general law, might very properly on its own motion have discharged the panel.</p>

The principal one is an exception on behalf of the prisoner to the refusal of the court to charge that there was no evidence tending to corroborate the testimony of the witnesses Jones and Nugent, who concededly by their own confession, were accomplices of the defendant in the commission of the crime charged in the indictment. The general facts relating to the alleged crime, as testified to by the accomplices, are that on and prior to January 2, 1883, Jones was lessee of a stable- in the,city of Albany and had procured an insurance of §500 on horses and property therein, which at the suggestion of Hooghkerk he increased to $1,000, with the understanding that Nugent was to fire the barn, for which he was to receive $100, and that the insurance money should be divided between Jones and Hooghkerk. It was a part of the arrangement that Hooghkerk should buy some cheap horses to be put in the stable in place of other more valuable horses to be removed before the fire.. The fire occurred Tuesday, January 2, 1883, at about 12:50 a. m. Mon<a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>day or Tuesday evening before the fire Hooghkerk, as Nugent testifies, brought two cheap horses to a point near the stable, and then exchanged them for two other horses belonging to Hooghkerk, which Nugent and one Streveli, by the direction of Jones, had taken from the stable, and the horses received from Hooghkerk were taken back to the stable and were burned in the fire. One or two other cheap horses were, as the accomplices testify, also purchased by Hooghkerk shortly before the fire and placed in the stable. It is not claimed that Hooghkerk either set the fire or was present when it was set. The evidence is that it was set by Nugent, who admitted the fact.</p>

It is sufficient to state that if their testimony is true, there can be no question of the guilt of the defendant. On the other hand, if their testimony is excluded from the case, it is not probable that he could have been convicted, although circumstances would remain calculated to excite grave suspicion. Christopher Ferns testified he sold a horse to Hooghkerk in December before the fire for $15, and delivered it within a few days,'and Hooghkerk testified that it was delivered New Years’ night. John Ernzart testified to the sale of a horse to Hooghkerk two or three days before New Years for $15, and to its delivery either Sunday or Monday night before the fire. George Brown testified to a like sale a few days before New Years for $10, and that the horse was delivered to Hooghkerk on Sunday or Monday night before the fire. John Feizenbaum testified that the defendant, Hooghkerk, about January 1, 1885, in the evening, brought to his place about a mile and a half from Albany, two bay horses, with collars and blankets, and left them with him a few days and then took them away. John Streveli testified he worked for Jones at the time of the fire ; that on Monday evening, the night of the fire, he went to the stable and found Jones and Hooghkerk there; that Jones' brought out two bay horses and askpd' him to go and help Nugent exchange them ; that they went with them to Washington avenue (about a block distant from the stable) and met Hooghkerk there in a carriage, with two other horses, which were <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>exchanged for the bay horses, which Hooghkerk took away, and that the witness and Nugent took the two horses received from him to the stable that he asked Jones what he was doing * that Jones said, “if I (Strevell) would keep still he would-give me $50,” and further, “ I did not want his $50, or know anything about his business, and I went home.”</p>

Prior to the statute the rule in this state permitted the jury to convict a defendant upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice (People <em>v. </em>Costello, <a href="/denio/1/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="1 Denio 83" data-case-ids="484105" data-case-paths="/denio/1/0083-01">1 <em>Den. </em>83</a>), but it was the uniform custom of judges to advise the jury that the evidence of the accomplice should be received with great caution, and it rarely happened that a conviction was had upon his unsupported evidence. The rule now embodied in the statute is substantially the rule which, before the statute, courts were in the habit of stating to the jury for their guidance, although, as has been said, it was not enforced as a rule of law. It is plain that independently of the statutory rule, corroborative evidence to have any value must be evidence from an independent source of some material fact tending to show not only <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>that the crime had been committed, but that the defendant was implicated in it, and such is the doctrine of the best considered cases. But neither the doctrine hitherto declared by the courts, nor the rule embodied in the statute requires that the whole case should be proved outside of the testimony of the accomplice. Such a rule would render the testimony of an accomplice in most cases unnecessary and would defeat the policy of the law which permits the use of accomplices as witnesses in aid of, and in the interest of public justice.</p>

The evidence of Strevell as to what took place at the barn in connection with the subsequent fire, leads to an inference of an incendiary burning. Indeed, this is the only reasonable inference from the conduct of Jones in attempting to bribe Strevell to keep silence, interpreted in connection with the mysterious exchange of horses, the fire and the insurance. The connection of Hooghkerk with the felony is not directly shown by testimony independent of the accomplices. But he is shown by Strevell to have been in the immediate vicinity of the stable shortly before the fire, engaged in the exchange of horses under suspicious circumstances. The fact that he purchased cheap horses, which were delivered to him on Sunday or Monday evening is established by the testimony of independent witnesses, and is indeed admitted by Hooghkerk, and the jury may well have discredited his explanation of these transactions. The testimony of Feizenbaum that Hooghkerk brought the bay horses to his place on the night of the fire, or about that time, confirms Strevell in part of his story, and closely connects Hooghkerk with the transactions of the night of the fire. It cannot, we think, be doubted that the circumstances proved outside of the testimony of the accomplices show such a relation between Jones and the defendant, and such a sequence of events as to justify the inference not only that the crime of arson was committed, but that Hooghkerk was accessory to it. The claim that Strevell was himself an accomplice, was properly left to the jury. The transactions he testifies to may have aroused, and probably did arouse, his <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>suspicions, but it is quite evident that he was not an original party to the scheme for burning the barn, and it was for the jury to determine whether, when the transactions testified to occurred, he had any guilty knowledge of the impending crime.</p>
    <p id="b241-4" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[106,610,1157,570]]]'>The declaration of Jones to Nugent in the absence of Hooghkerk, to the effect that the latter was engaged “ in the business of burning barns,” was coupled with the further declaration that he told Hooghkerk “ what Jones said.” The court replied to the motion to strike out this evidence by saying, “ I will retain it for the present. Tour motion is good unless it is connected in some way.” There was no subsequent motion made by the defendant in respect to this evidence. When the motion was made, it appeared,that the remark of Jones was communicated by Nugent to the defendant, and the exception to the disposition of the motion at that time was not well taken.</p>
