In the contemplation of the statute, it is sometimes for the public interest that the offense defined in the statute, which consists wholly in wrongs, affecting public moneys and rights of property, should be punished by fine rather than by imprisonment. The individual rights of the accused person may always be affected upon a trial of an indictment under this statute by the finding and statement of, or the omission to find and state, the amount of loss resulting from the offense. Justice also requires that such finding and statement should be made by the jury ; for the power of the court in fixing the penalty would, in every case, be greatly restricted or greatly extended, according as the jury should see fit to exercise this power of stating the amount of the loss.</p>

And upon the second of the theories above stated in support of the verdict, while as in this case the proof might show a loss of not to exceed $25,000, yet the jury might, by neglecting to make a finding of the amount, compel the court, if it exercised its discretion of imposing a fine at all, to impose a fine measured by five times the entire amount charged in the indictment, which, instead of being $37,000, amounts to $300,000.</p>

A reference to other provisions of the statute furnishes additional reasons for the conclusion, that the word <em>“ </em>may ” in the third section can only be interpreted to mean <em>“ </em>must.” The provision of section 1 is that"“ every person &amp;c. . . . shall <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>on conviction of such offense, be punished by imprisonment in a state prison for a term not less than three years, or more than ten years or by a fine &amp;c., ... or by both such imprisonment and fine.” The rvord here used is “ shall,” and this word “ shall,” by plain and necessary construction, applies to all that follows it in the sentence. The provision is that such persons <em>“ </em>shall be punished,” but the requirement goes further and is that he <em>“ </em>shall be punished by imprisonment &amp;c., ... or by a fine, &amp;e., . . .or by both snch imprisonment and fine, &amp;e.” The same sentence which gives the court power and imposes upon it the duty to punish the convicted person, also gives it the power and imposes upon it the duty to punish either by imprisonment or. fine or by both, according to the facts of the particular case. This requirement of the statutet needs no construction, and it is not open to misconstruction. And the reading of this section appears wholly to dispose of the second theory heretofore mentioned which has been advanced to support the judgment in this case, to wit, that the statute has intended to leave it to the jury to determine, whether in the particular case, the court shall have the power to impose a fine. The word “ may ” was used because it was the proper word with which to make a grant of a new power. The duty had already by section one been imposed and enjoined, and by section 3 the grant of power is made which enables it to perform that duty. And it is an ancient and well settled rule, that where any cause of doubt arises, although the doubt apparently attaches only to a particular clause, the whole statute is to be taken together and to be examined to arrive at the legislative intent. <em>Sedgwick Stat. &amp; Const. Law (2d </em>ed.) 199.

And the right to raise the objection is not waived because it was not raised when the verdict was rendered; nearly all defects appearing of record might be raised by motion or some other act by defendant before verdict.

In these cases no objection or exception was taken or motion made. They but illustrate the general fact that objections based upon defects appearing of record are not wraived by not raising them before trial or upon the trial, but are properly raised either by motion in arrest of judgment, or after judgment, by appeal. A motion in arrest of judgment is directed wholly to some defect in the record; but it has been held that the same objection can be raised upon a writ of error after judgment as upon a motion in arrest of judgment.

This appeal therefore brings before the General Term the entire record for examination, and if the verdict in any substantial particular is not such a verdict as is required by the statute under which the indictment was found, then the judgment is without legal foundation and should be re<a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>versed. The claim that this question cannot now be raised because this case was taken upon a bill of exceptions by a writ of error to the Court of Appeals is not well taken. The Court of Appeals must not examine the record to discover error until after, judgment has been entered in the Supreme Court.

And if not rightly organized, then it has not the powers of a court. Only the particular persons designated by law are vested with judicial power, and they are only vested with it, at the very times and places, and when they exercise it in the particular way prescribed by law. A justice of the Supreme Court undertaking to hold a court of Oyer and Terminer at a different place within the county from that fixed upon by the justices of the Supreme Court, pursuant to the statute, is without judicial power, and any criminal trials or convictions had at such place will, be void.

The <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>simple answer is that when another person or persons became so associated with the justice of the Supreme Court in that Court of Oyer and Terminer that the records of the court could •not be truthfully kept without making a record of them as a part of the court, the same as the Supreme Court justice, that moment he ceased to have any judicial power in that court, and the court itself ceased to be a court of Oyer and Terminer, becaiise not organized in conformity to the law creating it. It was not simply that they were incompetent to sit as members of that court, but that as soon as he consented to sit with them and allow them to participate in the exercise of the power of the court, and to be so entered in the record, that moment his judicial inability in that court became precisely the same as theirs. The record is conclusive evidence of the facts shown by it. 1 <em>Greenleaf Ev. </em>§§ 19, 32. 2. Defendant did not waive all objection to the illegal organization of the court by not making objection when he was called upon pursuant to the statute to state if he had anything to say why sentence should not then be pronounced upon him, for judicial power and authority is conferred only by law, and not by the consent of parties. And it appears to be well settled upon the authorities that any question involving the organization and constitution of the court or its fundamental mode of procedure cannot be waived by an accused person.

To accomplish this end, specific power was given the appellate court to formulate the appropriate judgment arid .to remit it, with the record to the court in which conviction was had-, with directions to pass sentence on the verdict in the form and to the effect as prepared by the appellate court.</p>

A judgment may be erroneous and not void, and it may be erroneous <em>because </em>it is void. It is within the power of the legislature to confer on a court the right to pronounce sentence on a verdict convicting the accused.</p>

So are all corrected and modified judgments in criminal or civil actions, in a certain sense, new judgments. Suppose a sentence wholly unauthorized by law be pronounced on a legal verdict, by a competent and duly organized court, the same is erroneous and void, for the reason that the same is without sanction of law. On appeal therefrom, this court has the undoubted right under the provisions of the present statutes to correct the same and conform it to the verdict. In doing this, the court does make up and give a new judgment in every respect. Ho part or feature of the void judgment can be retained,</p>

It cannot be doubted, but such was the intention of the legislature. It cannot reasonably be supposed that the legislature was ignorant of the well-established rule of law, that, if there has been a legal conviction on a good indictment, the accused cannot be re-tried on the same indictment after an erroneous judgment on the verdict has been reversed and set aside; nor can it be believed* that in codifying the law on this subject, it did not intend to preserve the provisions of the Revised Statutes, conferring on courts of review the power to give a proper judgment on a legal verdict on reversing an erroneous and void one, and thus to secure the punishment of guilty persons who have been legally convicted, and not allow law-breakers to escape altogether by reason of error in pronouncing the judgment of the law on a just conviction.</p>

It is now argued that the motion should have been allowed and the judgment arrested for the reason, that the verdict did not contain any finding or statement of the loss sustained from the offense committed by the defendant as required by the statute under which the indictment was found.</p>

The fact which may be found by the jury under the statute, is no part of the verdict. It must be stated with the verdict, when the fact is the language of the statute being; <em>“ </em>when rendering a verdict of guilty, upon the trial of any pei'son indicted under the act, the jury <em>may find </em>and state with their verdict, the amount of loss resulting from the offense of the defendant.”</p>

The statute is not imperative and peremptory in terms; the language is permissive.
