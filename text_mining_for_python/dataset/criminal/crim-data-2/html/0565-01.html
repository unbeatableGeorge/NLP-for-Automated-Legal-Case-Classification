The killing was not denied, but it was urged in defense that there was an absence of that deliberation and premeditation essential to the commission of the crime charged, and that the defendant was insane at the time of its perpetration.

He was conscious of a violation of duty in going into the saloon, and in reply to some one who interrogated him as to what he would do in case he was discovered, replied- that he should run him in. Almost immediately thereafter he commenced an abusive controversy with one Cantwell, and proposed to fight with him. He then produced some money, and offered to bet that he could whip any man in the room. Ho one accepted his offer. He invited the party to drink, and when the charge for the treat was stated to him, he angrily disputed it, and commenced polling the persons present to determine how many had drank upon his invitation. When one McGinnis stated that he had drank a glass of mixed ale, defendant called him a G—d d—d liar, and upon McGinnis retorting “ You are another,” knocked him down and kicked him. The crowd interposed to protect McGinnis, and gathered around the defendant, whereupon, he drew his club, and drove all except Cody, Keenan, Buckley, Keating and Cantwell from the room into a card-room adjoining. Some one else in the <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>card-room then attempted to open the door and look into the saloon, whereupon the defendant struck at him with his club, and broke a pane of glass in the door. He then pushed the door open and struck at the people in the card-room. Immediately after this he stepped backward into the saloon three or four paces, and, putting his hand into his hip pocket, endeavored to pull out his revolver. The witness, Keating, then expostulated with him, and said, <em>“ </em>For God’s sake, Billy, don’t fire ; those are friends of mine.” He continued his efforts, but the attempt was obstructed by the instrument catching in his pocket. He soon, however, released it, and in the language of the witness, Oody, “ turned to the left and leveled his revolver in the direction; by that I beckoned at my wife to go back when I saw the revolver pointed in the direction where she was, and Keenan and Cantwell. I spoke to her, and during the time I was speaking, the revolver was fired.” He fired the shot and Keenan staggered back, and he said “ I am gone.” Cantwell, who stook near Keenan, says, “I could not say whether he fired at me or Keenan, but he turned toward us.” The defendant, with Buckley and Keating, then went into the street, and, seeing two or three boys running away from the vicinity, threw his club and discharged three or four shots from his revolver at them. Reinforced by two policemen, to whom he stated that he had been fighting a mob, he returned to the saloon, where he was informed that a man had been shot. He there saw two men and inquired, “ Ain’t those two of the mob Being answered by Buckley that he had seen no mob that night, he said, “ I have been hit with bricks, haven’t I ?” Buckley replied, “Ho.” The defendant then gave the two men into the custody of his associates, and finding Keenan lying behind the bar, pulled him up by the lappel of his coat and compelled him to walk to the station-house. The evidence tended to show that he clubbed Keenan severely on the way, and inflicted bruises on his face, head and neck. On arriving at the station-house, Conroy stated to the police in charge that he was assaulted by a crowd of roughs in Thirty-sixth street, between First and Second avenues, while attempting to arrest Keenan for drunken and disorderly conduct. He charged that Keenan was drunk, and collected a crowd and used profane <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>language. About the same time, in an interview with Capt. Ryan, a policeman, he stated that he arrested a man of the name of Keenan for being drunk and disorderly; “ as I had him arrested, he assaulted me, and the crowd rushed on to me and took him away. I then drew my pistol and fired into the crowd, and I happened to shoot this man.” Soon after his arrival at the station, he had a conversation with Sergeant Cassidy, in which he stated that he arrested Keenan for being drunk and disorderly ; that he was attacked by a crowd and. his prisoner rescued. Upon being asked “ Is this man shot ?” he replied, &lt;£ Well, I don’t know; if he is not, it is not my fault, I tried hard enough to shoot him.”</p>
