No such mode of review ever existed before, and so we must look to the Criminal Code for all authority or limitation of authority. Unless the Code gives to the people this right .of appeal, the appeal must be dismissed. By section 518 the people may appeal to the Supreme Court in two cases: 1st. From a judgment for defendant on demurrer to indictment,; 2d. From an order arresting judgment; neither of which cover the present case. In no other case has the right of the people to appeal to the Supreme Court been given. The district attorney concedes that the right is not given by the Code of Criminal Procedure. The concession is fatal. This court may correct errors and mistakes only when they can be brought before us pursuant to law.
