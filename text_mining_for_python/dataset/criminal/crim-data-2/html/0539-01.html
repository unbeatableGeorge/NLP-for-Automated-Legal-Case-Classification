In form it makes it a crime for a cigar maker in Hew York and Brooklyn, the only cities in the State having a population exceeding 500,000, to carry on a perfectly lawful trade in his own home. Whether he owns the tenement house or has hired a room therein for the purpose of prosecuting his trade, he cannot manufacture therein his own tobacco into cigars, for his own use or for sale, and he will become a criminal for doing that which is perfectly lawful, outside of the two cities named, everywhere else, so far as we are able to learn, in the whole world. He must either abandon the trade by which he earns a livelihood for himself and family, or if able, procure a room elsewhere, or hire himself out to one who has a room upon such terms, as under the fierce competition of trade and the inexorable laws of supply and. demand, he may be able to obtain from his employer. He may choose to do his work where he can have the supervision of his family and their help, and such choice is denied him. He may choose to work for himself rather than for a taskmaster, and he is left without freedom of choice. He may desire the advantage of cheap production in consequence of his cheap rent and family help, and of this he is deprived. In the unceasing struggle for success and existence which pervades all societies of men, he may be deprived of that which will enable him to maintain his hold and to survive. He may go to a tenement house, and finding no one living, sleeping, cooking or doing any household work upon one of the floors, hire a room upon such floor to carry on his trade, and afterward some tone may commence to sleep or to do some household work upon such floor, even without his knowledge, and he at once becomes a criminal in consequence of another’s act. He may go to a tenement house, and finding but two families living therein independently, hire a room, and afterward by subdivision of the families, or a change in their mode of life, or in some other way, a fourth family begins to live therein independently, and thus he may become a criminal without the knowledge or pos<a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>sibly of the means of knowledge that he was violating any law. It is therefore plain that this law interferes with the profitable and free use of his property by the owner or lessee of a tenement house who is a cigar maker, and trammels him in the application of his industry and the disposition of his labor, and thus in a strictly legitimate sense it arbitrarily deprives him of his property and of some portion of his personal liberty.</p>
    <p id="b567-4" data-blocks='[["BL_567.4",567,[97,743,1167,833]]]'>The constitutional guaranty, that no person shall be deprived of his property without due process of law, may be violated without the physical taking of property for public or private use. Property may be destroyed, or its value may be annihilated ; it is owned and kept for some useful purpose, and it has no value unless it can be used. Its capability for enjoyment and adaptability to some use are essential characteristics and attributes without which property cannot be conceived; and hence any law which destroys it or its value, or takes away any of its essential attributes, deprives the owner of his property. The constitutional guaranty would be of little worth if the legislature could, without compensation, destroy property of its value, deprive the owner of its use, deny him the right to live in his own house or to work at any lawful trade therein. If the legislature has the power under the constitution to prohibit the prosecution of one lawful trade in a tenement house, then it may prevent the prosecution of all trades therein.</p>

That power is very broad and comprehensive, and is exercised to promote the health, comfort, safety, and welfare of society. Its exercise in extreme cases is frequently justified by the maxim <em>salus populi suprema lex. </em>It is used to regulate the use of property by enforcing the maxim <em>sic utere tuo ut alienum non loedas. </em>Under it the conduct of an individual and the use of property may be regulated so as to interfere, to some extent, with the freedom of the one and the enjoyment of the other ; and in cases of great emergency engendering overruling necessity, property may be taken or destroyed without compensation, and without what is commonly called due process of law. The limit of the power cannot be accurately defined, and the courts have not been able, or willing, definitely to circumscribe it. But the power, however broad and extensive, is not above the constitution. When <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>it speaks its voice must be heeded.

The general government is one of limited powers particularly specified in the Federal Constitution. But in addition to the powers granted it is provided in the Constitution that Congress shall have power <em>“ </em>to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers.” Under this provision Congress is not the final judge of what is “ necessary and proper,” but its laws must have a legitimate end in view, must be within the scope of the Constitution, must be appropriate and plainly adapted to that end, and not prohibited by, but consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, and whether the laws passed under the implied powers contained in the section cited are of the character mentioned, and thus justified, is always open to judicial inquiry.

It does not deal with tenement houses as such ; it does not regulate the number of persons who may live in any one of them, or be crowded into one room; nor does it deal with the mode of their construction for the purpose of securing the health and safety of their occupants or of the public generally. It deals mainly with the preparation of tobacco and the manufacture of cigars, and its purpose obviously was to regulate them. We must take judicial notice of the nature and qualities of tobacco. It has been in general use among civilized men for more . than two centuries. It is used in some form by a majority of the men in this state; by the good and bad, the learned and unlearned, the rich and the poor. Its manufacture into cigars is permitted without any hindrance, except for revenue purposes, in all civilized lands. It has never- been said, sd far as we can learn, and it was not affirmed even in the argument before us, that its preparation and manufacture into cigars were dangerous to the public health. We are not aware, and are not able to learn, that tobacco is even.injurious to the health of those who deal in it, or are engaged in its production or manufacture. We certainly known enough about it to be sure that its manipulation in one room can produce no harm to the health of the occupants of other rooms in the same house. It was proved in this case that the odor of the tobacco did not extend to any of the other rooms of the tenement house.</p>

The power ,would have been the same, and its exercise, so far as it concerns fundamental constitutional rights, could have been justified by the same arguments. Such legislation may invade one class of rights to-day, and another to-morrow, and if it can be sanctioned under the Constitution, while far removed in time we will not be far away in practical statemanship from those ages when governmental prefects supervised the building of houses, the rearing of cattle, the sowing of seed, and the reaping of grain, and governmental ordinances regulated the movements and labor of artisans, the rate of wages, the price of food, the diet and clothing of the people, and a large range of other affairs long since in all civilized lands regarded as outside of governmental functions.
