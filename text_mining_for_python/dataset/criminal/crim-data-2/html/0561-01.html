    <p id="b586-6" data-blocks='[["BL_586.8",586,[319,1015,1165,239]]]'>The ground upon which the Supreme Court reversed the conviction, was that the Court of Sessions erred in excluding a question put by the prisoner’s counsel to one of the witnesses for the prosecution on his cross-examination. The defense interposed by the prisoner was insanity.</p>

After this line of examination had been pursued for a considerable time and the witness had testified that the commission of a great crime, without any apparent motive, was some evidence of insanity, the prisoner’s counsel asked the witness the following question:</p>

Both by its assumptions and its suppositions the question suggested a case entirely dissimilar to the one on trial, and was a mere abstract inquiry. It was designed to depict a murderous assault, without any motive or provocation, upon three neighbors of the assailant with whom he had never had any trouble, but was on amicable terms, exchanging ordinary morning salutations and who were peaceably at work in their field; whereas, the facts in evidence were, that these three “ neighbors ” with whom the prisoner had never had any trouble, were Samuel Zoller and his two sons, who were claiming the right under a lease from John A. Augsbury, to work the farm on which the prisoner had long lived and which had belonged to him until he had been forced by pecuniary embarrassments to convey it to J. A. Augsbury.</p>

Purely imaginary or abstract questions, assuming facts or theories for which there is no foundation in the evidence, are not admissible as matter of right.
