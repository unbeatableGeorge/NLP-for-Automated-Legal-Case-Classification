McCormack had a knife, and struck deceased with it in the back, some where around the shoulder. Daly had a knife and struck at deceased. I think Daly struck him in the back. The fight lasted about five, six or seven minutes, then somebody cried “ cheese it,” and the officer fired a club, and they all ran away. Two young men picked up deceased and brought him to the corner. After, they ran away. Lynch came back first, McCormack second, then two or three, others and Daly.

If plaintiff in error was guilty of any offense,, it was manslaughter in either the second or third degree. Wharton thus defines murder: “Murder is where a person of sound memory and discretion unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being and in the peace of the commonwealth, with malice prepense or aforethought, either expressed or implied.” Vol. 2, 7th ed. § 938; 3 <em>R. S. </em>6th ed. 928. Manslaughter in the second degree is the killing without a design to effect death in a heat of passion, but in a cruel and unusual manner. Manslaughter in the third degree is the killing without a design to effect death in the heat of passion, with a dangerous weapon. 3 <em>R. S. </em>6th ed. 934. Wharton says: “ Manslaughter is the unlawful and felonious killing of another, without any malice either expressed or implied.” “ Manslaughter differs from murder in this, that though the act which occasioned the death be unlawful or likely to be <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>attended with bodily mischief, yet the malice expressed or implied, which is the very essence of murder, is presumed to be wanting, and the act being imputed to the infirmity of human nature, the punishment is proportionately less.” “ Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of another without malice, on a sudden quarrel, or in the heat of passion. Where, upon a sudden quarrel, two persons fight, and one of them kills the other, this is voluntary manslaughter ; and so if they, upon such occasion, go out to fight in a field, for this <em>is </em>one continued act of passion. So also if a man be greatly provoked by any gross indignity, and immediately kills his aggressor, it is voluntary manslaughter, and not excusable ; homicide not being <em>se defendendo, </em>neither is it murder, for there is no previous malice. In these and such like cases, the law kindly appreciating the infirmities of human nature, extenuates the offense committed, and mercifully hesitates to put upon the same footing of guilt the cool deliberate act and the result of passion.” 2 <em>Wharton Am. Cr. Law, </em>7th ed. §§ 930, 931, 938. See 1 <em>Hale P. </em>C. 453-456 ; 1 <em>Hawkins P. C. </em>29 ; 3 <em>Inst. </em>51; Commonwealth v.

This was refused and exceptions were taken to the decisions on behalf of the defendant. By the evidence it was made to appear that the defendant and four other persons, together assaulted and beat the deceased. They had him down upon the street, one of them struck him with a stone, and others cut him with knives.</p>
    <p id="b190-4" data-blocks='[["BL_190.4",190,[322,721,1164,1559]],["BL_191.1",191,[149,383,1151,833]]]'>What caused their disagreement out of which this assault upon him originated, did not clearly appear. They all drank together, and Daly and the deceased scuffled together. He was also knocked down, and at least three of these persons weie engaged in beating and cutting him while he was down. In doing this a stone was used by one of them, and knives by the others. But out of their preceding relations no evidence was given indicating that the assailants had any motive, or that it was any part of their design, to kill the deceased. The weapons and stone made use of were not applied in such a manner as to be evidence that they entertained that design, for none of the wounds made upon the deceased, as they were described, were so aimed or serious, as in the judgment of the first physician who was called and dressed them, could possibly be attended with the death of the deceased. While he had been struck upon his head and wounds inflicted by cuts upon his body, they were neither of them, nor altogether, considered of a dangerous character, and were inflicted evidently more for the- purpose of punishing the deceased on account of some unexplained disagreement, than with any intention to produce his death. This assault took place upon a Sunday night and he died the next night. A post-mortem examination was made of his body, and it was found that he had died from what was stated by the surgeon to be, meningitis. His statements of the wounds confirmed the description given by the physician who first examined and treated the deceased. But he added further that it was probable that this disease had been produced by an injury to the head, from the blows it had received, or from a fall, that under the circumstances they were likely to have been the cause developing this disease. But, after allowing all the weight that can be given to the evidence of the surgeon making this final examination, nothing can be held to have <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>been added to the case which would sustain the conclusion that in the blows which were inflicted, the defendant, or either of his associates, was actuated with the design to take the life of the deceased. It is highly probable, that as they were all more or less affected by drinking, that some common cause of disagreement arose between them, as is frequently the case with persons stimulated in this manner, leading them into the fight with the defendant, and that this was produced by such a provocation, as induced them severely to chastise him, without intending to kill him. It was what may be called a drunken brawl, not infrequently resulting in more serious consequences than either of the persons engaged’in it intended or expected. Heither the acts themselves, nor the instruments made use of, nor the wounds inflicted upon the body, with any reasonable degree of certainty, will sustain the conclusion that there was any intention on the part of either of the assailants to kill the person so assailed.</p>
