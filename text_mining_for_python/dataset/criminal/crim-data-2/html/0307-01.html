The recorder of Binghamton had no jurisdiction to try the charge (assault in the third degree) before himself summarily, for such offenses by the charter of Binghamton <em>(laws </em>1867, ch. 291, tit. 5, § 7), and by the Code of Criminal Procedure (§ 56) can only be tried by a court of Special Sessions, subject to the power of removal contained in said section 56. The charter provides that, “ The recorder or any justice of the peace, acting as such, may hear, try and determine in a summary way, any complaint for any violation of the laws of the state or the provisions of title twelve of this act, or of the ordinances of the city (of Binghamton) in any case where the right to trial by jury is not guaranteed by the constitution.

It does show that the recorder acted as such summarily; that before him as an individual, and not as a justice of the Special Sessions, the prisoner was brought.
