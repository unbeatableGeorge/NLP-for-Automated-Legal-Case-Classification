Have known defendant fourteen years. I will be 23 years old the 24th of October next. Eckert, the defendant, will be 19 this fall. He visited me at my father’s house. Began to come and see me two years ago last March and came to see me until a year ago Juiy. He asked me if I thought enough of him to marry him. I told him I thought he was too young. He said no he was not. He said he was very nearly as old as his father and mother were at the time of their marriage. I said I would marry him if he thought enough of me. After that he asked me to have connection with him. It was in May, two years ago last May, I had connection with him. He said he did not believe he could. I said I did not want him to. He said he would. He asked me more than once to have connection with him before I did have. It was after midnight. Between the time he came to see me and the time the connection took place he was trying to overcome me. He asked me if I would have connection with him. I said I did not want to. He said he would; that he would marry me and never go back on me. That is all he said. He had connection with me that night, and after that, up to until two months before the baby was born, which was a year ago last July 24th. Told him I was pregnant and asked him to marry me. He went away. He has never <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>married me. I never had sexual intercourse with any other man. The child I had here to-day is Eckert’s child. <em>Cross-Examined : </em>I was born in October, 1860. I was close to 21 and he to 17 when he first came to see me. I had kept company there with gentlemen four or five years. I had beaux that paid attention to me and took me out evenings. Would spend evenings with me a little while. Had had four or five. Have kept company a few times, with John Tanner, Millard WilMow, Denton Wilklow; once a little while with Nat Lyons, once a little while with Elias V an Vleet. They were all older than Eckert or myself. Have kept company a few times with Victor Chambers, when Eckert was a little bit of a boy. Have known Eckert since he was four years old. Lived about a mile from him. Went in company a good while before he did. He first came to see me at Jacob Hornbeck’s. I worked there. He stayed until midnight. Nothing said that night about marrying or having connection. He sat alongside of me, had his arms around me and kissed me. I asked him in. I wanted him to come in. He came again in the middle of the week. Everything was proper, and nothing said about marrying. He stayed about two hours. He came again the next Sunday night. I sat on his lap. Had his arms- around me and I had mine around him. Nothing said nor done improper that night. Then he came every week. Had come to see me four times before he began to act mean. That was in April. Put his hands on my person and under my clothes. Did that four or five nights. I let him come after he acted this way. Promised he would do better. He tried to force me different times. I did not call out. Had connection with me first in my father’s house. The lamp was turned down very low, and there was a bed in the room. It was the last of May.' We had talked about marrying the first of May. Along through April he had been trying to have" connection with me and to use violence and force me. Only one other person tried to take liberties with me—Chambers. I have sat on some of the other boys’ laps ; some of them had kissed me and had their arms around me. They had never talked to me about thinking a good deal of me. He, George, asked me if I thought enough of him to marry. I told him he was too young; that his father and <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>mother were mad about it, and he said it made no difference about them. He was the one, he would marry me; he did not try to have connection with me that night, nor did he take any liberties whatever. I did not tell him that night whether I would marry him or not. He said he would. There was no engagement of marriage between us that night. I said the Sunday night, after he had asked me if I had made up my mind to marry him, that I had. He did not have connection with me that night. The night he had connection with me he tried me until he got me nearly wore out. He was struggling with me from about ten o’clock until after midnight. I did not really consent; it was just overpowering me. I made no outcry. He stayed a couple of hours afterward. I did not tell Hannah M. Hornbeck in June of that year that I was in family way, or that I had got rid of a. child. . . . <em>Re-Direct: </em>The night George first had connection with me, he said he would marry me, and never go back on me, before he had connection with me. I believed him. Have never been married. After I became pregnant he brought me medicine to take, and I took five drops of it. <em>Re-Cross: </em>I said I was afraid he would not marry me. Didn’t know whether he would or not. I was afraid first and then believed- he would. I did consent to have connection with him in words. George went to school a few weeks the next winter after he came to see me.</p>

My father and mother are living. I live at home with them and always have. I was 18 years old the 30th of last December. In March, 1881, I was 16.

She told me she was <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>twenty-two when I was sixteen. Knew Victor Chambers. I knew of his paying attention to Sarah. Saw them together in bed, at my father’s house.

She was dressed. I was 11 or 12 years old. I didn’t know what it meant. I know of Millard and Denton Wilklow, John Tanner and Lucas Barley paying her attention prior to March, 1881. They would spend the evening with her. Know of Millard Wilklow spending the evening with her about March, 1881. He came and called me out of my father’s house. Went with him to Hornbeck’s. Sarah was there. He wanted me to call the dog and keep him by me while he got in. I did so. He went in. 1 had never had anything to do with her before. The Hornbecks were relations mine. I saw Sarah there a couple of weeks afterwards. I spent the evening with her. Stayed until about three o’clock. Did not sit up all the time we were there. Lay down on the bed. She said she was tired sitting up and wanted me to lie down. That was the first night I stayed with her, or had shown her any attention. We lay on the bed about four hours. When I went away she said I must come on the sly so my folks didn’t know it. She said if they found it out they would think I was too young. Went to see her again in the same way ; went to bed again. I never asked her in any form to marry me. I never promised or told her I would marry her, nor asked her if she thought enough of me to marry me. There was nothing mentioned about marrying. She never said she would marry me; nor was the subject of marriage ever discussed between us at all. I never asked her to have connection with me; nor did I say I would marry her, or stand by her, or words to that effect. I was at Van Leuven’s about three weeks. Part of the time I was in Port Jervis. Came back to my father’s, and stayed there. I was advised to go ; did not go of my own accord; came back of my own accord. Was never arrested on the indictment. Came down here of my own accord and gave bail. <em>Cross-Examined,: </em>The way Chambers <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>came to stay at our house all night, my father had gone off; Sarah came to stay with mother and Chambers to stay with me. My father was keeper of Sing Sing Prison and was away from home a good deal. Chambers was there four or five nights. Had not had breakfast when Sarah came up. She came to call us down to breakfast. I told my mother. She did not go up stairs. I ate breakfast. They were up there an hour, about. This was in 1876; I was then twelve years old. The day I held the dog for Millard Wilklow was the day my grandmother was buried. My grandmother lived at Jacob Hornbeck’s. Sarah was there. They had a funeral in the afternoon, and I held the dog so that Millard Wilklow could go and court Sarah in the evening. ... I have had sexual intercourse with Sarah.

My father and Simon Lyons advised me to go to Matamoras. They told me there was going to be a trap laid against me. I ceased going to school in 1882. I worked some in the garden and tend bar. My father is a tavern-keeper in this neighborhood. I can’t say how many times I went to see Sarah.

There was plainly such prejudice as should nullify the verdict. The testimony to which attention has been called shows the character of the complainant. She had been receiving for years the attentions of men much older than the defendant, some of whom, at least, had attempted to take undue liberties with her, and three of whom refused on oath to say whether or not they had had sexual intercourse with her. She had known the defendant ever since he was a baby. He was a mere boy at the time she says he committed the crime charged in the indictment. It seems impossible that any candid person can read the evidence and resist the conviction that she was the seducer. The jury convicted ; but they convicted the prisoner of being a bad boy, and not of the statutory offense. The former impeachment he did not deny, and that was enough for the jury.

On the trial the prosecutrix testified to the material facts constituting the offense charged, and that she became <em>enceinte </em>because of the intercourse between herself and the defendant. The fact of the birth of the child was undisputed. Evidence was also given of opportunity and probability, such as the frequent meeting of the parties, when they would be alone together, and generally of the seeking by the defendant of private interviews, and also of the bestowal by both of personal attentions.</p>

His evidence, if credited, would establish his innocence of the offense charged. Thus his credibility became a subject of great, if not of controlling significance. On his cross-examination, and with a view to this point, he was asked the question whether he had “ been having sexual intercourse with Emma Schoonmaker,”—a person in no way connected with the case. The question was objected to by the defendant’s counsel, and the objection being overruled by the court, he answered “Yes.”</p>

We need therefore only to refer to that case as decisive of the point here urged as ground of error.</p>
    <p id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[337,513,1168,673]]]'>On further cross-examination the defendant was, in substance, asked if he had not said to the father of the prosecutrix, on a certain specified occasion, that his own father had untruthfully said that he, the defendant, would rot in jail before he would marry the prosecutrix; and he denied having so said. Proof in contradiction of such denial by the defendant was offered on behalf of the prosecution, and was admitted against objection. In this, we think there was no substantial error. The evidence had a bearing upon matters in issue, in this : it bore upon the question whether the defendant had made to the prosecutrix a promise of marriage. It was, it is true, somewhat remote, but not so entirely remote and disconnected with the issue and irrelevant to the offense charged as to preclude its contradiction.</p>

It is certainly a very peculiar one in some of its leading features. The facts, taken as a whole, must to say the least, admit of strong suspicion as to the real existence of the imputed crime. They invite well-grounded criticism. The defendant, was at the time of the alleged seduction under promise of marriage, a mere lad, a stripling, a school-boy, but little more than sixteen years of age. The prosecutrix was nearly six years his senior, a woman of comparatively mature years, and according to the proof, of very considerable experience with men of about her own age. It can but be observed that seduction of the lad might probably be quite as readily accomplished as could be the seduction of the mature, reflecting, experienced woman. She had known the young man almost, or quite from his infancy; must have known and appreciated the fact that any proposition of marriage from him or agreement with him to marry was of questionable propriety. She was not entirely .untutored in the ways of the world, for, as she states, she had accepted the attentions of men while he was yet a “ little bit of a boy.” She was certainly qualified to give him good advice against wrong-doing, and well able in her maturity to resist vicious importunity, even under circum<a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>stances of stronger temptation. '■ And this would be naturally expected, rather than that she should accept from one so young a proposal of marriage, and under a protestation of faithfulness to his promise, to join him in the commission of crime. Nor was the illicit intercourse confined to a single occurrence under stress of circumstances, but was deliberately permitted from time to time, even continued, as she testifies, from “ that night and after that, up to until two months before the baby was born.”</p>
    <p id="b507-4" data-blocks='[["BL_507.4",507,[112,770,1170,1076]]]'>Is the case free from well-grounded suspicion as to the integrity of the charge ? If a seduction, it seems to have been a seduction with a continuando—a seduction singularly effected, in view of her maturity and of his immaturity; and most strangely continued. The line of conduct as testified to by her, beginning with the alleged promise of marriage, followed by continual intercourse for a considerable time, and indeed permitted long after pregnancy had ensued, seems inconsistent with any idea of the woman’s seduction, holding in mind the provisions of the statute which makes seduction a punishable offence. See Penal Code, § 284. The crime denounced by the law is the seduction of a female of chaste character under promise of marriage. The law contemplates infraction of purity in thought and conduct. Now in the outset we are confronted with the unusual circumstances of persons contracting marriage under an almost ludicrous disparity of age, having in mind the nature of the offense charged; the male just turning the period of pubescence, and the female a woman, as has been stated, of ma-tare years and very considerable experience in the ways of the world, with knowledge, as we must infer, of usual moral and social observances, and of what are universally regarded as the proprieties attending a matrimonial alliance.</p>
    <p id="b507-5" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[113,1851,1164,439]],["BL_508.1",508,[354,381,1166,933]]]'>Besides these considerations, how stands the further and other proof bearing on the alleged contract of marriage, and purity of character, both of which are necessary to the establishment of the crime charged in the indictment ? It is in proof that the prosecutrix accepted attentions from and had confidential relations with various men ; not with one or two only, but with many. She permitted them unbecoming familiarities. Beyond dispute, she was free and easy with them to an extent indicative of great laxity of moral obligation. These statements <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>as to the proof leave out of view the testimony of the defendant, and also that of the witness," Chambers, who was undoubtedly effectually impeached. But it may be noted, as it was proved by several witnesses, that the plaintiff was particularly and peculiarly intimate with this man, who was shown to be lecherous and vile. The case on the reliable evidence bears hard on the probability of the alleged promise to marry, and of the purity of character of the prosecutrix. Before the defendant could be legally convicted, a case should be made' against him on all material points beyond a reasonable doubt. We are of the opinion that no fair-minded man can carefully and thoughtfully read the evidence here submitted without entertaining great doubt as to the defendant’s guilt of the offense charged. We are dissatisfied with the verdict of the jury. We must conclude that they either misunderstood the provisions and requirements of the law applicable to the case, or that they gave the evidence undue force through inattention or misapprehension. We cannot in conscience permit the conviction and judgment to stand.</p>
