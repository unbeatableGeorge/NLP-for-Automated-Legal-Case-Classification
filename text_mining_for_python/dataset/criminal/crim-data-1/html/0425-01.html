Crim. 198" data-case-ids="1164446" data-case-paths="/ny-crim/1/0198-01">1 <em>N. Y. Crim.

It was in that case held by the Court of Appeals, affirming the decision of this court and of the Court of Sessions, that, where an indictment had been found by a grand jury, drawn under this very law and in the very manner now in question, it should not be quashed on the defendant’s motion. It cannot be necessary or proper to argue that question again. Whatever else may have been said in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, that principle was absolutely decided, and such decision should govern. The Oyer and Terminer, then, should not in this case have quashed the indictment. We think the learned justice must have seen that his decision in this respect was contrary to the law of the Petrea case. For a large part of his opinion is made up of citations of authorities, principally from other states, tending to show that the decision of the Court of Appeals is wrong, and that an indictment found by a grand jury selected under an unconstitutional law, should be quashed on the defendant’s motion.</p>

But this cannot be. That decision held that no constitutional right of the defendant was invaded by holding him to answer under the indictment, although the same facts appear there as appear here. An indictment cannot be quashed before it is found. After it is found the facts now alleged present no reason for quashing it, as was decided in the Petrea case. Hence <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>the same facts can never be a ground for quashing an indictment; because, until an indictment shall be found, a motion to quash cannot be made.

    <p id="b456-4" data-blocks='[["BL_456.4",456,[328,631,1155,777]]]'>The first objection to this part of the order which is obvious is that just stated, viz : That on a motion by a person held to trial, the court assumed to discharge the grand jury as to him, and allow it to stand as to others. How could such an order be properly made at the opening of the court, or at any other time? Would the court on May 7, have summoned another, especially for this defendant? Would the court have charged the one grand jury to inquire as to all crimes except those oí Thomas Fitzpatrick, and the other to inquire as to his only ? It is plain that even when we treat this order as one made at the opening of the court, it is inconsistent with itself. Again, there are more serious objections. This paper filed by the defendant, call it by any name he may please, is really, in effect, a challenge to the array. This is a well known term, which calls for no definition. Similar objections were defined to be a challenge in the Petrea case. <a href="/citations/?q=28%20Hun%2C%20440" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="28 Hun, 440">28 <em>Hun, </em>440</a> <em>; <a href="/ny-crim/1/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="1 N.Y.

    <p id="b456-5" data-blocks='[["BL_456.5",456,[326,1412,1157,582]]]'>Now section 238 of the Code of Criminal Procedure forbids any challenge to the panel or to the array of a grand jury. The counsel for the defendant urges that this section does not prevent objections made before the grand jury is impaneled. But a challenge is an objection made to the swearing in and impaneling of the grand jury, not an objection made after they are sworn in and impaneled. Such has been the ordinary meaning of the word, and in that sense the legislature must have used it when it forbade challenges to the panel or array. It would be trifling to enact a section which meant that challenges to the panel or array could not be made after a grand jury was sworn in and impaneled, but might be made before.</p>

One would suppose there was not much necessity to prohibit challenges to the. panel or array of a legal grand jury. The section means just <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>what it says. That is, that challenges or objections to the panel or array of the grand jury can no longer be taken. It was evidently thought that as the grand jury was only an accusing body it was unnecessary to give an accused person the right to make objections to the details of its selection.</p>

    <p id="b457-6" data-blocks='[["BL_457.5",457,[119,1175,1161,1068]]]'>The learned judge, however, places this order on another ground. Section 238, above cited, after forbidding challenges, provides that the court may, in its discretion, discharge the grand jury and order a new one to be summoned for any of several causes ; among them, “ that the requisite number of ballots was not drawn from the grand jury box of the county.” We can hardly understand how the order appealed from could have been made in the exercise of that discretion. Because the learned justice says in his opinion that “ whenever it plainly appears that every safeguard of law in the selection of grand jurors has been disregarded,” &amp;c. (that is, by the enactment of the very excellent chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881), then it was a wise exercise of discretion to set aside the supposed panel and to order a new panel to be summoned. How, if this were so, the same wise discretion would seem to require that other indicted persons should be protected as well as this defendant. And it would seem an unwise exercise of discretion to grant as a special favor to this defendant the safeguard to which others were equally entitled. Yet the order, in the discretion of the court, withholds from those who have not made the objections “ the guaranties which the constitution gives to every citizen for his protection.”</p>

      <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>It may be remarked in passing, that while in the opinion of the Court of Appeals in the Petrea case the act in question was spoken of as unconstitutional, yet it was distinctly held that the question of constitutionality could not be raised by the defendant in that case. As it could not be raised by him, it could not in that case be decided by the court. As is said by Judge Finch in People <em>v. </em>Brooklyn, Flatbysk &amp; Coney Island Tí. It. Co. (<a href="/citations/?q=89%20N.Y.%2092" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="89 N.Y. 92">89 <em>N.

    <p id="b458-5" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[320,1189,1160,1120]]]'>The Court of Appeals had held that such a grand jury was competent to find valid indictments. ■ Why, then, should the court of Oyer and Terminer set aside- this competent, jury ? The requisite number of ballots had been drawn. These ballots had been drawn from the only box and list of jurors made up in the county from which to draw grand jurors. This box and this list were in fact the grand jury box and list. It was plainly immaterial what the box was called. It held, in fact, the names selected under color of law as gj’and jurors. And there was no other box or list from which grand jurors could be drawn. This box and this list were to such extent the box and list from which to draw grand jurors, and it had been held by the Court.of Appeals that a grand jury drawn therefrom was a valid grand jury. For what possible reason or under what discretion, then, should a grand jury so drawn be set aside? Not the least objection was made to the competency or qualification of any or all of them. If the learned justice had refused to set the jury aside, the indictments found by them would have been valid and the administration of the criminal law would not have been obstructed by an objection without any real merit. We think it was not a wise exercise of discretion to set aside a body of unexceptionable men, whose competency to find indictments had been established by the Court of Appeals.</p>

This is carried a step further in assuming that it is a wise discretion to set aside a body of competent officers against the mode of selection of whom, even if it be illegal, no one has the right to set up any objection.</p>

It was, 1 as I think, improper to quash or set aside the panel as to Fitzpatrick, yet in effect hold it good as to all other persons charged with crime who omitted to interpose objections, inasmuch. as the objections raised a question of jurisdiction. If the panel was without jurisdiction as to Fitzpatrick’s case, it was equally without jurisdiction as to all others similarly charged.</p>
    <p id="b459-9" data-blocks='[["BL_459.10",459,[139,1579,1158,326]]]'>But we are asked to consider the case on the merits, just as it was examined in the court of Oyer and Terminer, to raise the validity of the objection urged against the panel by Fitzpatrick, as regards the mode of drawing, summoning and impaneling the grand jury.

The authorities upholding this conclusion are cited in Petrea’s case, as well in this court as in the Court of Appeals. It was said in the latter court, in answer to the objections here urged, that an indictment found by a body drawn, summoned and sworn as a grand jury, <em>before a competent court, </em>and composed of good and lawful men, fulfill the constitutional guaranty that a jury so formed was a <em>de facto </em>jury, because selected and organized under the forms of law; that a defect in its constitution, owing to the invalidity of a law under which a panel was drawn, affected no substantial right of one charged with crime ; hence an objection based thereon was not available to him. So it was held “ that an indictment found by a grand jury of good and lawful men, selected and drawn under <em>color of law, </em>was a good indictment by a grand jury within the sense of the constitution, although the law under which the selection was made was void.” It would seem to follow that if an indictment, when found, would be good and valid, it could hardly be maintained that the grand jury which found it acted without jurisdiction or authority in the premises. I am of the opinion that the decision in the Petrea case determines all questions presented on this appeal against the objections urged in the Oyer and Terminer in Fitzpatrick’s behalf. It follows that the order appealed from should be reversed.</p>
