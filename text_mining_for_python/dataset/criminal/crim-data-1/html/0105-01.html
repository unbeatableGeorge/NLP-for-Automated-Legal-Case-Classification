The inspector had informed the prisoner that he had seen him trying to steal a barrel of whiskey the night before he arrested him. Having thereby informed the prisoner that he had seen him committing a felony, he in effect told him that it was in his power to lock him up on this charge. This was a positive threat, and the confession which followed it was not a voluntary one. Even the statement itself shows that the coroner used language which has always been held to render a confession inadmissible. It is as follows : <em>“ </em>Coroner Herman also called my attention to the fact that I should consider well before I made a statement, as he would ask more from me regarding the shooting of Mr. L.

On the trial, proof having been given tending to show the commission of the burglary in which the prisoner had participated, and of circumstances also tending to establish the fact that the prisoner-while so engaged fired the fatal shot, a statement made by him before one of the coroners of this city, was offered in .evidence. This statement is a confession of the crime of burglary and the shooting of the deceased by him. Its reception in evidence was objected to on his behalf, upon the ground that it had been obtained by threats and improper influence, and was not in conformity to the provisions of the. statute in reference to statements made before magistrates.</p>

He was then asked by the inspector if he knew who he was, and was told by the latter that he was an inspector of police. The inspector then said, “ I told him I saw him do several things and try to steal in South Fifth avenue the night before I arrested him. I told him I had been watching him since the shooting and saw him in company with a man named Healey, and saw him try to steal a barrel of whiskey the night before I arrested him.” He also said, “ I told him about the pledging of the pistol” (that is, the pistol with which the shooting was done). In answer to a question by the court: “ Did you make any threats to this man ?” Inspector Byrnes said, <em>“ </em>Ho, I did not.” He was then asked by the recorder, <em>“ </em>Did you hold out any inducement to him?” and he answered, “Ho sir, I did not, not any.” • And further, “ You merely stated what you did ?” and he replied, “ Yes sir,” and further; “ and that you were an inspector of police ?” and he replied, “ Yes sir.” The inspector then further testified : “ MeGloin said he would make a statement. I said I would send for Coroner Herrman to take- it.” And it appears by the statement that MeGloin was informed by Coroner Herr-man of the matter which was before him, and that he had the privilege and right either to make a statement or not. It also appears by his confession that the coroner called his attention <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>to the fact that he should consider well before he made a statement, as he would ask more from him regarding the shooting of Iianier. It does not appear, however, from the statement itself that any questions whatever were asked by the coroner.</p>
    <p id="b134-4" data-blocks='[["BL_134.4",134,[304,654,1155,873]]]'>The statement which is contemplated by the statute is regulated by the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, sections 198, 199 and 200. But these provisions apply to an examination before a magistrate for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not a crime has been committed, and not to any proceeding before a coroner. The statement, therefore, cannot be declared to have been taken under or in reference to these provisions ; indeed, it must be regarded entirely as extra-judicial. It is governed and controlled, therefore, in its value and effect by section 395 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that a confession of a defendant, whether in the course of judicial proceedings or to a private person, can be given in evidence against him, unless made under the influence of fear produced by threats. Whatever may have been the'rule prior to the enactment of this section, the law o.f this State is now settled by its features, because the objection to the confession is limited, it would seem, to the proposition that it was made under the influence of fear produced' by threats.</p>

It was also urged against the reception of the confession that it was one to which the prisoner had been sworn, and which made it, it was contended, particularly objectionable under the authorities. The learned counsel for the prisoner seems to treat the confession as a statement made by a witness upon an examination in a proceeding before a magistrate. We have seen that this view' cannot be sustained. It was not. taken during the ordinary investigation which takes place before a coroner as to a death and its cause, nor was the prisoner a witness. <em>Not only </em>that, but he knew the offence of which he was charged, and made the statement, after being advised of it, and voluntarily.</p>

If the confession, therefore, should be regarded as the prisoner’s statement upon the stand as a witness, after having been advised, as he was, of the charge made against him, it would have been admissible on the authority of the case cited, and the exception founded on the. proposition just considered is therefore unavailable. The objections to the admission of the confession thus considered were properly overruled for these reasons, and <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>the confession itself properly admitted in evidence. It is also urged, on behalf of the prisoner, that the testimony of one Frederick Banfield, who had been convicted and sentenced for the commission of a felony, and had not been pardoned should not have been received in evidence, although no objection was made on the part of the prisoner to his examination or to the testimony which he gave. His evidence related to statements made by the prisoner to him affecting the question of his guilt. The objection rests upon the section of the Eevised Statues, which declares that a person who is sentenced for the commission of a felony shall not be competent to testify in any cause, matter, or proceeding, civil or criminal, unless he be pardoned by the governor or by the legislature, except in cases specially provided by law. 3 <em>R. S. </em>6 ed. Banks, p. 994, § 43.</p>
    <p id="b136-4" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[304,1082,1158,531]]]'>By chapter 448, Laws of 1876, section 832, it was declared, however, in antagonism to this section, that a person convicted of a crime or misdemeanor is, notwithstanding, a competent witness, but the conviction may be proved for the purpose of affecting the weight of his evidence, and a doubt having arisen as to whether the section applied to criminal prosecutions, the legislature, in 1879, in order to remove it (see chap. 542, Laws of that year), amended the section by adding, after the words “ competent witness,” the words “in a civil or - criminal action or special proceeding.” The same provision is contained in section 714 of the Penal Code, passed in 1881.</p>

He contends that the legislature, not having in express words repealed them, intended, by leaving them thus unrepealed, to make a distinction between criminals convicted and sentenced, allowing the former to be witnesses and the latter not.</p>

It is the conviction, and not the sentence, which creates the objectionable event in the life of the witness and is the primary cause of his disqualification. A person convicted <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>might not be sentenced before being called as a witness, either because of delay in the performance of that ceremony, or because of the suspension of judgment. The sentence is the result of the conviction, and pronounced as a punishment for the crime committed, and is therefore secondary in its nature. The greater includes the lesser. The provision of the Revised Statutes is repealed by implication because it and that in the Code are utterly inconsistent with each other.</p>
    <p id="b137-4" data-blocks='[["BL_137.4",137,[126,796,1166,779]]]'>It would be absurd to hold that the legislature intended to absolutely disqualify as a witness a person who was sentenced for the commission of a crime, and to preserve his qualification if only convicted. The legislation of 1876 and 1879, was designed to affect the existing rule on the subject and to abrogate it; see note to section 832 in Throop’s Code, ed. 1877 ; and it may well be, if the matter were at all considered in the respect mentioned, that the conviction was regarded as the first and most salient, and therefore controlling incident in the element of disqualification, as it certainly is. For these reasons it is: thought that the evidence of Banfield was properly received. It is further contended that there should be a new trial by reason of the refusal to grant a request to charge. The first count to the indictment, as we have already seen, charged the defendant with having committed a felony, and whilst so engaged, with having killed the deceased.</p>

Before the jury can consider the proposition as to the killing whilst in the perpetration of a felony, they must find that there was evidence, exclusive of the confession of the prisoner, that the felony had been committed. That the prisoner’s alleged confession is not sufficient to warrant the juryin finding affirmatively, that the offense of burglary or grand larceny, or both of said offenses, had been committed, without additional proof on the subject.” Which the court refused, and exception was taken to such refusal.</p>

He requested the court to charge the jury that they could under the indictment convict the plaintiff in error of manslaughter in the first degree, and the request was granted. If the request considered involved the proposition, that in order <em>to </em>convict the plaintiff in error of murder in- the first degree, under the first count of the indictment, it would be necessary to establish the elements expressed, it would have been erroneous to have refused to charge it. And that this view was taken of it by the learned recorder, is very clear from the fact that the next request to charge, and which was granted, was, that if the jury found the alleged confession of the prisoner to be the only evidence of the larceny or burglary, or both of these offenses, they could not convict of murder in the first degree, under the first count of the indictment. This was charging the law of the case as formulated by the prisoner’s counsel, and although it had been substantially charged before, <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>was thus repeated. The jury was doubly instructed, therefore, that to justify a conviction of murder in the first degree, it was necessary, in accordance with the provisions of section 395 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, supra, to establish by sufficient proof thereof, in addition to the confession, that the crime charged had been <em>committed,—i. </em>&lt;?., that a felony had been committed by the prisoner, and that, whilst engaged in the commission of it, he had killed the deceased.</p>
