The court had submitted already the question involved in the sixth request, and it was not error to decline to repeat the charge. As a whole the charge presented the questions to the jury clearly and fully, and called upon the jury to resolve the disputed questions of fact, and their verdict seems to accord with the weight of the evidence.
