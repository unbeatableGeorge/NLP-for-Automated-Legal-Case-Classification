That the v itness, who saw him do so, informed a police officer of what he had seen, and caused the arrest of the appellant. That there was no violence used by the appellant, nor was any threatened by him. Ho property was taken from the woman or from her person, nor was there any proof that the pocket into which the appellant thrust his hand, contained any property of any value.</p>

At common law, an assault is defined to be an attempt or offer with force or violence, to do a corporal hurt to another; an intentional attempt by violence to do an injury to another; any unlawful physical force, partly or fully put in motion, creating a reasonable apprehension of immediate physical injury to a human being.</p>
