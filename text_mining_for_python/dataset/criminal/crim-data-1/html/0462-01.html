    <p id="b487-6" data-blocks='[["BL_487.8",487,[127,885,1154,470]]]'>The plaintiff in error was tried separately and convicted. The evidence showed that in the spring of 1881, Cooney owned six salt-blocks—three in Syracuse, and three at Greenpoint, in the town of Salina, and that the three blocks last mentioned were burned about one o’clock in the morning of April 23, and the salt block described in the indictment was burned about fourteen hours later. The counsel for the people gave evidence which he claimed tended to show that both fires were caused by the agency of the plaintiff in error, and the persons indicted with him.</p>
    <p id="b487-7" data-blocks='[["BL_487.9",487,[129,1372,1158,921]],["BL_488.1",488,[336,410,1164,1011]]]'>The prosecution put in evidence against the objection and exception of the counsel for the plaintiff in error an anonymous letter received by Cooney about two days before the fires, threatening him, in a certain contingency, with the loss of his life and the burning of his salt-blocks. There was no proof of the authorship of the letter. The only evidence tending to connect the defendant with it, in any way, was the following : It was proved that Cooney,.on receiving the letter, caused it to be published in one of the newspapers in the city, and the next morning, on his going to the salt-block, where Riley and Wright were at work, Riley, in the presence of Wright, said to Cooney that he would be billed for publishing the letter, and that his salt-blocks would be burned. It is now contended by the counsel for the people that the letter was admissible as part of the <em>res gestee </em>and as evidence of the extent of the alleged conspiracy The difficulty with the position is that as against the plaintiff in error it is evidence of nothing whatever. He is not shown to have had any hand in writing or sending it, or to have known of its existence till he heard it spoken of by Riley in <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>the conversation above stated. ' The letter was probably received in evidence for the purpose of showing why Cooney was watching his property and was in a position to see who approached it shortly before the fire broke out. But it was wholly unnecessary to show a reason for <em>his </em>watchfulness; or, if proof of the reason tended to corroborate his testimony that he watched, or made it more probable, it was enough to state in general terms that he had been put on his guard by the receipt of an anonymous letter, without giving its contents. It is obvious that the letter may have had an effect upon the jury very damaging to the plaintiff in error. Its reception was error. . It was also error to admit proof of what Biley said to Cooney in the presence of Wright, as above stated. The court remarked, in overruling the objection to it on behalf of Wright, that it was competent as against him upon the theory that silence gives consent. But that rule applies only against a party who is so concerned in what is said as that unless he speaks, his silence may fairly be construed as an admission. Wright was in no such position; Biley’s remark was not prompted by anything Wright had said, and he was not called on to make any reply to it.</p>
