The language of the latter act, where the sections are connected is, that every person having a husband or wife living, who shall marry, &amp;c., shall be guilty of bigamy, except where the former marriage has been dissolved for some cause other than the adultery of the person contracting the subsequent marriage. There could scarcely be a plainer implication than that, for the purpose of enforcing the statutory prohibition, a person against whom a divorce has been obtained for that cause is regarded <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>by the statute as having a husband or wife living, so long as the party obtaining the divorce lives.</p>

In that case it was held that a violation of the prohibition against marriage of the guilty party contained in the divorce act, did not constitute bigamy, and the reasons assigned for that conclusion were that the divorce dissolved the former marriage and, after such dissolution-, neither party could have a husband or wife living; that, consequently, such a case was not included in section 8, and the provisions of that section could not be enlarged by the exception contained in the third subdivision of section 9.</p>

Y. </em>95</a>). In that case the plaintiff claimed dower in lands left by a husband from whom she had obtained a divorce <em>a vinculo </em>on the ground of his adultery. There is no express provision of the statute declaring a widow entitled to dower under such circumstances, but the right of dower is not taken away ; and its continuance is impliedly recognized in section 48 of the divorce act (2 <em>R. S. </em>146), which declares that a wife convicted of adultery in a suit for a divorce brought by her husband shall not be entitled to dower in her husband’s real estate. In the case cited it was argued by Mr. Hill that the right to dower could only be acquired by the death of the husband; that only a widow had a dowerable capacity,, and that she must have such capacity at the time of his death ; that she could be endowed of <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>lands of her deceased husband only; that she must survive her husband, and that she must be a wife at the time of his decease, or she cannot be his widow ; that the marriage being dissolved, she ceased to be his wife and could not be his widow. But this construction of language was not suffered to prevail, and it was held that, although the term widow might not be the most appropriate term to employ under these circumstances, yet it was sufficient to designate the person entitled to dower, and the conclusion was that the divorced wife was entitled to the benefit of the statute which awards dower to the widow.</p>

S. </em>146) is also instructive as showing that for some purposes the Legislature apply the terms “ husband ” and “ wife ” to parties between whom a decree of divorce <em>a vinculo </em>has been pronounced. The language of section 48 is “ a wife,” being a defendant in a suit for a divorce brought by her husband, and “ convicted ” of adultery, shall not be entitled to dower in her “ husband’s ” real estate. The terms <em>“ </em>husband ” and “ wife ” are thus applied to the parties after the judgment of divorce has been rendered, without the addition of the term <em>“ </em>former,” or any' other term indicating that the parties had ceased to answer the description of husband and wife.</p>
