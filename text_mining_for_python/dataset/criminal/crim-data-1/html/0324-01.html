This is an application . on the part of the prisoner for a new trial, on the ground of newly discovered evidence, the evidence offered being that of Dr. Hardy and two others—one an officer at Jefferson Market, and the other an officer of the -twentieth Precinct. The killing was committed on April 26, 1882. The trial was held on September 21, 1882. On the trial the defense was that the shooting was an accident; and the prisoner on his own behalf gave. a very distinct and connected statement of the occurrence as he claimed it to have occurred. That defense the jury did not believe, and convicted the prisoner ; and the case has-been to the Court of Appeals, and the prisoner is now under sentence of death, the judgment having been affirmed.</p>

The condition and state of the prisoner were well known to himself long before the trial. He was in his perfect and sober senses during his confinement in the Tombs under the charge. Ilis testimony on the trial showed that he had full knowledge <em>of </em>the facts at the time, and even prior to the killing, and that he could easily have obtained all the evidence now sought to be brought in on this motion. There were no witnesses who were absent or who had to be sought at a distance. They were at all times within his reach, one of them, the doctor attached to or attending in the very prison in which he was. It seems therefore very plain that not only was there haches in producing .the evidence, but gross <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>laches ; and so gross are the laches that we must look to another point of the case to see why the evidence was, apparently, not produced. Although there was the grossest laches, still, if the evidence was important, the court, in a case in which human life is at stake, should be very guarded in depriving the prisoner of the slightest right he may possess. But in this case, it seems to me that the prisoner’s act in not producing this evidence is easily explained and entitles him to no relief. He knew there was no living witness of the act of shooting, who could be examined on that point against him, and he apparently made up his mind that he would take the risk of putting his defense on the .fact that the shooting was accidental.. To make his testimony of any use on this point with the jury they must,' from the evidence, be led to believe that he was fully able from his mind being clear, and knowing what he was about, to describe what took place. With the evidence now sought to be put in, he would have weakened his chance of escape on the plea which he expected would have given him an entire acquittal. He apparently recklessly chose this course, with the intent, by a manufactured story, to escape entirely from the charge, and, having failed in it, he now wants to use evidence, which, if of any value, had always been within his reach, and there is not the slightest evidence to show that he was ignorant of it.</p>

What are the condition and state of mind of a prisoner at the time of committing the act are among the first and most important considerations, and the fact that they were considerations in this case is evident from the questions asked as to his drinking and drunkenness. The opinion of Mr. Justice Daniels in the case of People <em>v. </em>Leighton (<a href="/citations/?q=10%20Abb.%20N.%20Cas.%202" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Abb. N. Cas. 2">10 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>2</a>-61), goes over this ground so thoroughly that it would be useless for me to discuss the questions here. But supposing neither of the grounds stated to be sufficient to deny the application, it seems to me it should be denied on the ground that the evidence would not change the facts in the case in the least. The defense of the prisoner was not his condition. He never pretended that whatever he did he did not do with full knowledge. His defense <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>was that the shooting was accidental. At the trial, and long before it, he was certainly sane and sober, and not affected by drink. He went to trial with the full knowledge of all former acts, and his counsel on this motion would have the court hold that the jury would hold on this new evidence that the prisoner’s plain testimony on his own behalf, when cool and sober, showing that he knew exactly what occurred and what he was doing, was not reliable, and that these witnesses, who did not see him at the time when he committed the act, but who only saw him either days before the shooting or after he realized the terrible act he had committed, knew his condition and mind better than himself.</p>

An appeal from an order denying motion for a new trial, in a capital case, lies to the General Term of this court, and is not precluded by section 517 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As originally enacted, section 466 of the Code of Criminal <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>Procedure provided as follows: “ The application for a new trial must be made before judgment; ” and by section 485 the Clerk of the court, where the conviction was had, was required to include in the judgment roll, upon service upon him of a notice of appeal, among other papers “ a copy of the minutes of any proceedings upon a motion for a new trial or in arrest of judgment’ and on an appeal to this court from the judgment on a conviction after judgment.” Any actual decision of the court in an intermediate order or proceeding forming a part of the judgment roll, as prescribed by section 485, was reviewable; see section 517. Subsequent to these, enactments and in the year 1882 the legislature amended section 466 by adding to the then existing provisions, “ except in case of a sentence of death, when the application may be made at any time before execution, and in case the court before which the trial was had is not in session, so that the application can be made and. determined before the execution, then the application may be made to any justice of the Supreme Court, or Special Term thereof, within the judicial department where the conviction was had.” Although omitting to amend section 517 of said Code so as to expressly include an appeal from an order denying a motion for a new trial made after judgment, it is clear that the legislature did not intend to deprive the defendant of such remedy. It was the design of the legislature to extend rather than restrict in capital cases, the rights of the defendant, and to hold that in availing himself of the right conferred by section 466, as amended, to move for a new trial after judgment, the defendant had forfeited his right to have the determination of such motion reviewed, is to hold that the legislature in extending the time to make such motion intended to deprive the defendant of the right to have such determination reviewed. Clearly such a construction would defeat rather than aid the manifest intent of the legislature and the whole spirit of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is much more reasonable to claim that the legislature, in amending section 466, regarded this appeal as provided for by section 527, which recognizes “ an appeal to the supreme court from a judgment of conviction, or other determination from which an appeal can be taken,” for, at the same session of the legislature, and with the evident intent to <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>give force to the prior amendment of. section 466, by an amendment to section 527, the appeal, as a matter of course, in capital cases operates as a stay until the determination of the appeal, without the certificate of the judge as required in all other cases. But regardless of the provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this is an order of a justice of the Supreme Court affecting a substantial right of the defendant, and is, therefore, re viewable, under section 465 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The right to review the decision of a single judge, sitting at special term, in a matter affecting substantial rights, being general and fundamental, it must be deemed to exist unless the intent to destroy it is expressed with great clearness.

Section 517 of the Code of Criminal Procedure declares in what cases appeals may be taken by the defendant in criminal cases. It is-in these words: “ An appeal to the Supreme Court may be taken by the defendant from the judgment on a conviction after indictment, and upon the appeal, any actual decision of the court in an intermediate order or proceeding forming a part of the judgment roll as prescribed by section 485 may be reviewed.” Section 485 makes provision for the inclusion in the judgment roll which may be brought up by the appeal under section 517, of “ a copy of the minutes of any proceedings upon a motion either for a • new trial or in arrest of judgment.”</p>
    <p id="b355-6" data-blocks='[["BL_355.8",355,[186,1373,1163,874]],["BL_356.1",356,[330,395,1166,484]]]'>. Provision is therefore made for the revision of motions of this character when they are embraced in the judgment roll as provided Vy section 485. But we look in vain in the act for any provision for an appeal on a motion for a new trial in any case except in the case and form presented by section 517. At common law no appeals could be brought from judgment orders or interlocutory proceedings in criminal cases. The right of appeal in such oases is purely statutory; but in cases where there is no statutory provision, the right of appeal does not exist. The code has made no statutory provision for an appeal from an order denying a motion for a new trial in any case where the motion is made after final judgment in the action, unless the findings and order be embodied in the judgment roll. It has, however, by. the provisions of the act of 1882, now section 517 of the Code, granted to the convicted party an opportunity to make a motion in the trial court in capital cases, or when the application cannot be made to the trial court prior to the execution of the sentence, by application to a justice of <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>the Supremo Court or a Special Term thereof. But while it has given this new privilege to a party convicted of a capital crime, where sentence of death has been pronounced, the legislature has not seen, fit to superadd the right of appeal by any statutory provision. It has only granted an additional privilege to the convicted party which terminated with the application to the court or judge before whom the motion is made. A majority of the court have come to the conclusion that this is the correct view of the statutory provisions and of the law in respect of the right of appeal in such cases.</p>

These grounds are enumerated by section 465. They are seven in number, upon all or either of which a motion of this character can be made under section 466.

    <p id="b356-7" data-blocks='[["BL_356.7",356,[311,2110,1159,189]],["BL_357.1",357,[171,403,1161,96]]]'>On such a motion the court or judge is to act not only upon the affidavit presented, but also of course upon the testimony and proceedings had and taken upon the trial at which the conviction occurred; and it must be considered whether the <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>evidence claimed to be newly discovered if it had been given upon the former trial would probably have changed the verdict.</p>
    <p id="b357-4" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[169,502,1165,780]]]'>How if we take the case the prisoner made for himself and assume that his testimony would have been the same if this new evidence had also been produced, we can hardly conceive it possible for the jury to have rendered any other verdict, because liis own evidence and the manner in which he detailed the act which constituted the homicide and the manner in which he states what he did on that day and what he said, and the effect of his version of the transaction, would be in direct conflict with all that is sought to be added upon the new trial. If the new evidence had been given in the case, the jury would have been driven to the necessity of rejecting his own account of the affair in order to give him the benefit of the new evidence now sought to be introduced.- So that we are not able to come to any conclusion different from that reached by the justice at Special Term upon the question whether it would probably have changed the verdict.</p>
    <p id="b357-5" data-blocks='[["BL_357.5",357,[169,1287,1162,239]]]'>But if we had reached a different conclusion we must then be satisfied that the evidence has been discovered since the trial within the meaning of the law. That it existed before the trial is indisputable. Has it been discovered since the trial within the meaning of the law ?</p>
    <p id="b357-6" data-blocks='[["BL_357.6",357,[169,1531,1164,678]]]'>We must assume that the prisoner, on the former trial, knew that he had been arrested ten days previous to the commission of the crime in a state of intoxication, had been in prison three days and subject to the close confinement described in the affidavit by reason of his conduct, although he may not have known the exact condition physically and mentally in which he then was. All that preceded the crime, therefore, in respect of his condition, so far as relates to the intoxication and the arrest and imprisonment for intoxication, were known to the prisoner. If it was known to him before the trial, it cannot properly be called newly discovered evidence. It was a fact, which it was his duty, if he regarded it as important, to have made known to his counsel and to have had it brought to the attention of the court by summoning witnesses.</p>
    <p id="b357-7" data-blocks='[["BL_357.7",357,[172,2214,1159,93]],["BL_358.1",358,[316,410,1165,434]]]'>What occurred after the commission of the crime and his arrest as detailed by the affidavit of the prison doctor is also not <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>newly discovered. It is not the development of some unknown fact, but of facts which had previously existed, and must well have been known to the accused. If he were under the treatment of the medical man who makes the affidavit is there any question blit that that fact was within his knowledge ? The only thing newly discovered is the fact that it might have been of some importance to himself if it had been produced. That is not what the law contemplated when a party seeks a new trial upon this ground.</p>
    <p id="b358-4" data-blocks='[["BL_358.4",358,[308,851,1170,1462]],["BL_359.1",359,[172,403,1177,867]]]'>But again, it must appear not to be cumulative. The fact that it is not cumulative must be shown affirmatively. In this case it appeared by the testimony of several of the witnesses, and to some extent by the testimony of the defendant himself, that he had been drinking for some days'before the commission of the crime, and that he was intoxicated at the time of its commission. The subject therefore of'his condition by reason of the use of intoxicating drinks was one circumstance presented by the testimony for the consideration of the jury. It would be cumulative evidence in the meaning of the law to give additional proof of his intoxication and of its effect prior to the commission of the crime, by producing the witnesses who could testify to those facts. There is, therefore, no doubt that the learned court was correct in holding that if this evidence was produced it would be cumulative in.its character. We do not lose sight of the fact insisted upon by the learned counsel that the evidence goes so far as not merely to show habits of intoxication, but also that the prisoner had by the use of sedatives as well as of intoxicating liquors produced a diseased condition of the mind which he was incapable of controlling. That evidence, however, would of necessity, have been required to be sufficient to convince the jury that his mind was in such a condition as to be incapable of forming a deliberation and premeditation required to constitute murder in the first degree. But evidence upon that question was of necessity before the jury. The whole case, as a matter of course, involved the condition and mental operations of the accused party at the time of the commission of the crime, In such cases that question is one of primary importance. If, therefore, any evidence is produced on the trial to establish that the mental condition of the party was such <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>that he did not or could not form the deliberation required by the statute, all that has a tendency to make that more potent in its influence on the minds of the jury is cumulative. So ihat if any accused party relies for the purpose of proving the' character of the crime, upon the condition of his mind at the time of doing the act, he must proceed to establish that condition by the production of all evidence bearing upon that question, within his knowledge or which he could have procured by proper diligence. In this case the prisoner went into that evidence to a certain extent. He brought before the jury the proof of the fact that he had been drinking and was intoxicated to some degree on that morning ; and accompanied that evidence with his statement, clear, coherent, and as it appears from the record if credited by the jury, justifying a verdict of minor character, because of the alleged accidental nature of the act which caused the death. All the evidence that is offered here relative to his condition is in our opinion cumulative within the sense of the law.</p>
    <p id="b359-4" data-blocks='[["BL_359.4",359,[173,1284,1163,142]]]'>In addition, however, to the things already noticed, the section requires it to appear that the failure to produce it on the trial was not owing to want of diligence.</p>
    <p id="b359-5" data-blocks='[["BL_359.5",359,[170,1431,1166,716]]]'>It is perfectly obvious, as we think, that the failure to produce this evidence upon the trial was owing to want of diligence. We do not mean to impute wnnt of diligence in any sense of neglect of duty, to the counsel employed. They have at no time been lacking in diligence in doing their whole duty toward this prisoner, and the motion now pending is in itself strong evidence not only of diligence but of extreme diligence in favor of this unhappy man. But what the law means by lack of diligence is the omission on the part of the accused to disclose the facts to his counsel, so as to enable him to judge whether matters of any kind are within his knowledge would be important to him on the trial. Diligence on his part would have disclosed the fact of his arrest ten days before for intoxication, his confinement in prison and the treatment he was subjected to, and that that indicated the condition of mind as now claimed.</p>
