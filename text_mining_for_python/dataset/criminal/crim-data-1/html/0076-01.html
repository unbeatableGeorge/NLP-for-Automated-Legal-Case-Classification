If the question presented by this case were a new one, we should have no hesitation in holding that the conviction was justified by the evidence ; for, it is clear that there was no intention on the part of the complainant, in handing the §20 gold piece to be changed, to part with his property in it, but that he simply parted with the possession for the specific purpose of having it changed, so as to enable him to pay to the appellant twenty-five cents out of change, and that the appellant, having it for a specific purpose, and without property, his possession was, in law, the possession of the owner of the coin, and his subsequent act in gambling it away was such a conversion as ought, and in our opinion does, constitute the crime of larceny. But the case is precisely parallel in all its features to that of Reg. v. Thomas, 9 <em>Carr, &amp; </em>Payne,741. In that case the prisoner took a sovereign to go out and get it changed, but never returned with it or the change.

Y. </em>394</a>, the facts were these: The prosecutor handed to the prisoner a $50 bill to take out ten cents, in payment for a glass of soda. The prisoner put down a few coppers upon the counter, and, when asked for the change, he took the prosecutor by the neck and shoved him out of doors, and kept the money. The question was, whether larceny could predicated upon these facts. The court of appeals, affirming the decision of this court, held that the prisoner was rightfully convicted. The prisoner relied upon the case of Reg. <em>v. </em>Thomas; and, after reciting the facts in that case, the court proceeded to distinguish it from the one then at bar by stating that in the Thomas case “all control, power and possession was parted with, and 'the prisoner was entrusted with the money and <em>was not expected to return it. </em>Here, as we have seen, the prosecutor retained the control, and legally, the possession and property. The line of distinction is a narrow one, but .it is substantial and sufficiently well defined.” The learned chief judge had previously, in describing the transaction in Hildebrand’s case, said as follows:</p>
    <p id="b105-5" data-blocks='[["BL_105.5",105,[136,1827,1156,478]],["BL_106.1",106,[328,423,1154,182]]]'>“ But in this case I do not think the prosecutor should be deemed to have parted either with the possession of or property in the bill. It was an incomplete transaction, to be consummated in the presence and under the personal control of the prosecutor. There was no trust or confidence reposed in the prisoner, and never was intended to be. The delivery of the bill and the giving change were to be simultaneous acts, and until the latter was paid, the delivery was not -complete. The prosecutor laid his bill upon the counter, and impliedly told the prisoner he could have it on delivering to him the sum of <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>$49.90. Until this was done, neither possession or property passed, and in the meantime the bill remained, in legal contemplation, under the control and in the possession of the prosecutor.”</p>
    <p id="b106-4" data-blocks='[["BL_106.4",106,[393,618,1044,44]]]'>This opinion had the unanimous concurrence of the court.</p>

Y. </em>61</a>, the same learned judge said: “ If money or property is delivered by the owner to a person for mere custody, or for some specified purpose, the legal possession remains in the owner, and the criminal conversion of it by the custodian is larceny. A familiar illustration of this rule is the case of servants entrusted with the care of property belonging to their masters. In Smith <em>v. </em>People, <a href="/ny/53/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="53 N.Y. 111" data-case-ids="512910" data-case-paths="/ny/53/0111-01">53 </a><em><a href="/ny/53/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="53 N.Y. 111" data-case-ids="512910" data-case-paths="/ny/53/0111-01">N. Y. 111</a>, it </em>was said by <em>Allen, </em>J., “The rule is that when the deli veiy 1 of goods is made for a single and specific purpose, the possession is still-supposed' to reside; not parted with, in the first proprietor.” In Hildebrand’s case the possession of the bill was delivered in the bar-room of the accused, for the purpose of being changed to take out the- sum of ten cents in payment for a glass of soda. The prisoner took and kept the bill and refused to deliver the change.</p>

The prisoner took the same for the purpose of getting it changed, went out to get the same with the consent of the complainant, but, instead of getting it changed, he went to a gambling place, and lost it in gambling. He had nothing but naked and manual possession for a specific purpose, totally without property.</p>

If it had been taken from the possession of the prisoner by violence, the owner could have maintained trespass for injury to his property, and it would have been entirely proper, if the appellant had been robbed of the coin, to have averred, in an indictment for the robbery, the ownership in the complainant. The distinction in the cases is so extremely “narrow” that we should have felt entirely justified in disregarding it, but for the fact that the court of appeals in Hildebrand <em>‘v. </em>People gave its sanction to the case of Beg. <em>v. </em>Thomas, and declared it to be sound law, thereby holding, in effect, that <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>a conviction of larceny could not be sustained in a case like this.</p>
