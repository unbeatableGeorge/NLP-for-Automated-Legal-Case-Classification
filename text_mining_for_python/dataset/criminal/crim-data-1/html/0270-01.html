No appeal, however, is provided from the judgment or determination of the Court of Sessions. The former Code pertained to procedure in civil actions and proceedings, the latter Code to criminal actions and proceedings. Subdivision 9 of section 3347 of the former Code, expressly provides that the chapter in reference to appeals in civil action's and proceedings does not affect the review of proceedings in criminal actions; all of the statutory provisions in reference to these proceedings are embraced in the Criminal Code.</p>
    <p id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[323,1088,1160,630]]]'>Our conclusions' are, therefore, that sections 1340 and 1357 of the Code of Civil Procedure, have no longer any application to these proceedings, and, therefore, do not authorize a review by appeal to -this court. Section 515 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that “ writs of error and <em>certiorm'i </em>in criminal cases as they have heretofore existed are abolished, and hereafter the only mode of reviewing a judgment or order in a criminal action is by appeal.” Then follow the provisions for appeals to Supreme Court from the judgment of a conviction after indictment, etc. It will be observed that the writ of error and <em>certiorari </em>are abolished only as to <em>criminal actions. </em>No provision is made for abolishing the writs as to special proceedings of a criminal nature.</p>

Heretofore, it has been the practice to review these proceedings in that court upon the common law writ of certiorari, and such we regard as the correct practice under the present Code. The district attorney should have moved seasonably to have had the appeal dismissed, instead of bringing the case on for argument on the appeal. In view of the fact that the defendant was probably misled by the decision of People <em>v. </em>Davis, we are of the opinion that the defect' should not be deemed to have been waived. Upon the trial, the district attorney asked of the the mother of the bastard child, who was then a witness upon the stand, this question: “ Look at the <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>child and tell what the color of its eyes are ?” This question was objected to by the defendant, upon the ground that it was immaterial, incompetent and improper. The objection was overruled and exception taken by the defendant. The witness answered, <em>“ </em>Its eyes are blue.” We are of the opinion that this was an error. This evidence enabled the court to compare the color of the child’s eyes with those of the defendant, who was present in court. We do not regard this kind of evidence as safe or proper.</p>
    <p id="b297-4" data-blocks='[["BL_297.4",297,[152,861,1165,573]]]'>In the case of Petrie <em>v. </em>Howe, reported in <a href="/thomp-cook/4/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Thomp. &amp; Cook 85" data-case-ids="4462322" data-case-paths="/thomp-cook/4/0085-01">4 <em>Thomp. &amp; Cook, </em>85</a>, the question was as to the color of the child’s hair. It was held in that case that such evidence was calculated to and probably did prejudice the defendant, that it was improper, and a new trial was granted. The argument used in that case in reference to the color of the hair applies with equal force in this case as to the color of the eyes. Common observation reminds us that in families of children different colors of hair and eyes, are common, and that it would be dangerous doctrine to permit a child’s paternity to be questioned or proved by the comparing of the color of its hair and eyes with that of the alleged parent. We discover no other error in this case.</p>
