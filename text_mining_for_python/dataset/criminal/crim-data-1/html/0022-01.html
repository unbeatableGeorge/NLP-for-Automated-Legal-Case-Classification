If he gave evidence tending to overthrow it, the prosecutor might produce answering testimony, but he must satisfy the juiy, upon the whole evidence, that the prisoner was responsible ; for the affirmative of the issue tendered by the indictment remained with the prosecution to the end of the trial.

In this holding we confirmed the conclusion reached in the present case by the presiding judge at general term, that when the judge gives to the jury in his charge the true rule applicable to the case, when <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>it comes to’be considered on all the evidence, it is not error to refuse .to submit a separate proposition, which, even though correct in itself, is only calculated to confuse the jury by distracting their attention' from the test question, which is to be determined on the whole evidence. These remarks apply specially to the case at bar, for the request to charge is by no means as accurate as that in the' case of O’Connell. It involved two propositions: first, that the defendant is not bound to prove his insanity to avail himself of that defense. This is inaccurate, for he must, beyond cavil, give proof of it, or the presumption of sanity prevails, and the request was not confined to conclusive proof or proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Secondly, that he is only required to create a reasonable doubt as to his sanity. This is extremely vague, and well calculated to mislead, especially as connected with the first branch of the request. It is not even confined to a doubt arising upon the evidence.
