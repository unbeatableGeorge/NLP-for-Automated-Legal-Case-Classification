After the very general opinions given by the Dr. Trowbridge, based upon personal examinations of the prisoner and upon the evidence of two of his important witnesses, adverse to the defense interposed, there was the jnost ample foundation laid for a thorough searching and critical cross-examination of the witness.</p>
