He met Courtney by appointment at Canal street and the Bowery, Courtney having stated to him that he expected to get a check on that day.</p>

Similar statutes exist in other States of the Union (see Bishop on Crim. Pro. 3 ed. §§ 1169, 1170, note), and amongst others, in- the State of Texas. The statute in that State forbids a conviction on the testimony' of an accomplice, unless corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the offense committed, and is, therefore, substantially the same as ours.</p>
    <p id="b92-5" data-blocks='[["BL_92.5",92,[321,1160,1162,1170]],["BL_93.1",93,[170,414,1166,1354]]]'>The Supreme Court held, in considering it in Coleman <em>v. </em>State (44 <em>Texas, </em>109), that the rule -of law forbidding a conviction on the testimony of an accomplice, unless corrobo-, rated by other testimony tending to connect the defendant with the offense committed, was under the statute positive and peremptory, and that however much the jury might be disposed to credit the accomplice, the defendant could not be convicted legally, unless the evidence of the accomplice was confirmed in some material matter tending to show the defendant’s guilt. And the learned justice said in that case, <em>“ </em>To allow convictions1 to stand where the corroboration is only in immaterial matters, would be to violate both the letter and spirit of the statute, and to disregard those precautionary rules which experienced and wise jurists have deemed it necessary to adopt in order to guard against erroneous convictions based on evidence unreliable, because coming from a corrupt source.” And in the case of State <em>v. </em>Thornton (<a href="/citations/?q=26%20Iowa%2080" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="26 Iowa 80">26 <em>Iowa, </em>80</a>) the court, in considering a Statute similar to the one under consideration, said, <em>“ </em>Admitting, as we do, that corroborating evidence; to be sufficient, must not merely relate to the commission of the offense or the circumstances thereof, but must be evidence of a character that shall connect the defendant with the commission of the alleged criminal act, it is the opinion of the court that evidence of this character was. produced by the State.” The corroborative <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>evidence must be of some material fact, and this was the rule in reference to the evidence of accomplices in this State, if corroboration were relied upon, and indeed, the general rule. What appears to be required (See <em>Roscoe Tr. </em>122, 6 Am. ed.), is, that there should be some fact deposed, independently altogether of the evidence of the accomplice, which, taken by itself, leads to the inference not only that a crime has been committed, but that the prisoner is implicated in it. In the case of the People <em>v. </em>Davis (<a href="/wend/21/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="21 Wend. 309" data-case-ids="2151873" data-case-paths="/wend/21/0309-01">21 <em>Wend. </em>309</a>), the charge excepted to was that the accomplices of the prisoner were not to be believed by the jury unless confirmed by other credible witnesses in respect to the facts connecting the prisoner with the possession of the forged bills, or with the manufacture of them; but the court declared that no error had been committed, because it was not necessary by existing rules that every part of the testimony should be confirmed, the question usually being whether the jury will believe the witness in such parts of his narrative as the confirmation extends to, and quoted with approbation the observation of Mr. Justice Andeeson in summing up the case of Bex <em>v. </em>Wilkes (7 <em>Carr. &amp; P. </em>272), namely, that the confirmation he always advised juries to require, was a confirmation of the accomplice in some facts which went to fix the guilt on the particular person charged. The confirmation in People <em>v. </em>Davis, <em><a href="/wend/21/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="21 Wend. 309" data-case-ids="2151873" data-case-paths="/wend/21/0309-01">supra,</a> </em>was the possession by the prisoner of the forged bills, which if not of the essence, went to the point of the offence charged, and if believed, the court said, pressed strongly against him and laid a foundation for giving credit to the narrative of his associates.</p>

But there is no other evidence in the case affecting him—no proof that he participated in the money which was received by the check, no proof that he was in any way concerned with its preparation or presentation, no proof of bad character; whilst he most positively denies all participation in the criminal act.</p>
