By section 719 of the Penal Code, the offense must be punished according to the law existing when it was done ; and the provisions of that Code do not apply. Section 9G2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, shows that that Code applies simply to procedure. I see, therefore, nothing objectionable in the indictment.</p>

      <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>That the crime is alleged to have been committed in June, 1878; that the indictment was found in September, 1883; that under <em>2 </em>R. S., on p. 726, sec. 37, as amended by chap. 630, Laws 1873, while an indictment for murder may be found at any time after the death, other indictments must be found within five years; that, therefore, as the defendants could not have been lawfully indicted in September, 1883, for manslaughter alleged to have been committed in June, 1878, they cannot be convicted of such crime under an indictment for murder; notwithstanding the general statute. <em>2 R. S. </em>p. 702, sec. 27.</p>
    <p id="b555-4" data-blocks='[["BL_555.4",555,[85,936,1156,83]]]'>This undoubtedly presents an important question and one on which no decisions are found in this state.</p>
    <p id="b555-5" data-blocks='[["BL_555.5",555,[85,1034,1159,332]]]'>The position taken by the prisoners’ counsel may seem to be within the equity of the statute. It may be said that if the prisoners could not have been indicted for manslaughter in September, 1883, it would be unjust that they should be convicted of that crime upon an indictment then found; that the statute might be evaded by procuring an indictment for murder against persons who were guilty only of manslaughter.</p>
    <p id="b555-6" data-blocks='[["BL_555.6",555,[87,1370,1159,482]]]'>But I think I am bound to take the strict language of the statute, and that I have no right to extend it by implication. That statute limited simply the time for finding indictments. Along with that statute stood the section last quoted, that upon an indictment for any offense consisting bf different degrees, the jury may find the accused guilty of any degree of such offense inferior to that charged, or of an attempt to commit such offense. I do not think I have a right, by construction, to interpolate into that section, 27, the words <em>“ </em>if such indictment be found within the time prescribed for such inferior degree.”</p>
    <p id="b555-7" data-blocks='[["BL_555.7",555,[89,1856,1161,288]]]'>It will be noticed that section 27 also authorizes the finding the accused guilty of an attempt, etc, etc. There are special provisions for punishing attempts. <a href="/citations/?q=2%20R.%208" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 R. 8">2 </a><em><a href="/citations/?q=2%20R.%208" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 R. 8">R. 8</a>. </em>p. 698, sec. 3. Could the court assume to say that under this section 27, on an indictment for murder, whenever found, the jury might not convict of an attempt?</p>

But I must follow it as it is. One case cited by the district attorney, that of" Clark <em>v. </em>State (12 <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>Georgia, 350), appears to be exactly analogous, and to sustain the view I take. I shall, therefore, decline to charge that (if the evidence should justify) the jury have no right to find the prisoners guilty of any crime but murder on this indictment. Whether the evidence is such as to prove any other crime, is a very different question.</p>
    <p id="b556-4" data-blocks='[["BL_556.4",556,[331,699,1155,619]]]'>The district attorney urges that chapter 160, Laws of 1838, section 1, makes (what I may call) train wrecking a felony. That under section 445, Code of Criminal Procedure, the defendants may be found guilty of that crime on the ground that it is necessarily included in that with which the defendants are charged in the indictment. Section two of said chapter 160, provides that the previous section shall not extend to cases where death to a human being shall result from the commission of either of the offenses. Plainly, this intended to leave the crime, in such cases, to stand on the statute defining the second case of murder in the second degree, viz., homicide perpetrated by an act imminently dangerous, etc. Chapter 333, Laws of 1876.</p>
