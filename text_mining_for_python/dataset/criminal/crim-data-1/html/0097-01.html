And as the defendant did nothing more with the money at that time than to take it from one place on the table and deposit it upon the other, it may reasonably be presumed that this was all that he intended at the time when he took up the coin. All that he did was to transfer the coin from one place to another place, upon the table, and in the absence of any other circumstance tending to warrant the conclusion that by that act he intended to appropriate the money feloniously to his own use, the presumption arising would be that such was not his intention, but that he was actuated by the mere purpose of changing the loca<a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>tion of the money upon the table.
