The evidence was wholly given by him to establish the alleged violation of the statute, and it was insisted in the defendant’s behalf that she could not be convicted upon it, without further proof tending to connect her with the commission of the offense.</p>
    <p id="b98-9" data-blocks='[["BL_98.11",98,[307,1970,1159,337]],["BL_99.1",99,[132,395,1160,1109]]]'>This objection was presented under section 399 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which has in terms prohibited a conviction upon the testimony of an accomplice, unless he be corroborated by such other evidence as tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime. But this witness in no manner participated in the act declared by the statute to be an offense. That was made out by the .sale itself, without license, <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>and the person making the sale is the only one declared by the law to be criminal. The purchaser has been subjected to no criminal accountability whatsoever, and by the mere purchase he could not be a participant in the performance of the act which the statute has declared to be an offense... That was.performed wholly and conclusively by the defendant,, for she, unaided by the purchaser,’ acted alone in making the sale. An accomplice is a person involved, either directly or indirectly, in the commission of the crime. To render him such, he must, in some manner, aid or assist, or participate in the criminal act, and by that connection he becomes equally involved in guilt with the other party by reason of the criminal transaction. This witness incurred no such relation to the offense committed, and therefore was not an accomplice within the meaning of this section of the Code. A point similar to this arose in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Willard, <a href="/mass/39/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="22 Pick. 476" data-case-ids="2045786" data-case-paths="/mass/39/0476-01">22 <em>Pick. </em>476</a>, and Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Downing, <a href="/mass/70/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="4 Gray 29" data-case-ids="2075637" data-case-paths="/mass/70/0029-01">4 <em>Gray, </em>29</a>, and it was held by the court pronouncing those decisions that such a purchaser was not an accomplice.
