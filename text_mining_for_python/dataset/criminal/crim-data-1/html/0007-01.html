It would be sufficient, in answer to the exception which was taken to the refusal of the recorder to charge this request, that the burden of proving sanity does not fall upon the people in any case. The prisoner is arraigned, and the jury are impanneled with two legal presumptions existing—one that he is innocent, and the other that he is sane. If the prisoner is to be relieved from the consequences of his offense, by reason of a mental infirmity existing at the time of his transgression, amounting to insanity, it becomes his duty, or the duty of some person on his behalf, to overcome the presumption of sanity by satisfactory evidence, and the people may rest upon the presumption of sanity with<a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>out resorting to any proof.

The learned counsel for the plaintiff in error, no doubt, designed to state that it was sufficient for his client to create a reasonable doubt upon his sanity, but the request does not contain that proposition.

It was held that in these two paragraphs of the charge taken together there was no error, and the court in reviewing the trial said that the prisoner was bound to prove that he was not sane, and whether insanity was called an affirmative issue, or it is stated that the burden of proof of insanity is on the prisoner in order to overcome the presumption of sanity, is not very material.if the jury are told, as they were, that a reasonable doubt upon that question entitled the prisoner to an acquittal.</p>

The cases are analogous and parallel. The precise question presented by the exception, although it has not been definitely decided in this state, and although it may seem to be in doubt (see People <em>v. </em>McCann, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20N.Y.%2018" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="58 N.Y. 18">58 <em>N.

Upon both the important points presented, the instructions given the jury were in strict accord with the authorities which have long been regarded as correct expositions of the law. In MchTaghten’s case, the proper course to be followed in the disposition of the defense of insanity was considered and determined by the house of lords, the highest English judicial authority. And it was then held that “every man is to be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until .the contrary be proved.” And “ to establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.” “ If the accused was conscious that the act was one which he ought not to do, and if that was, at the same time, contrary to the law of the land, he is punishable.” 10 <em>Clark &amp; F. </em>200, 210. The same subject received the consideration of the court of appeals in Flanagan <em>v. </em>People, <a href="/ny/52/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="52 N.Y. 467" data-case-ids="510994" data-case-paths="/ny/52/0467-01">52 <em>N.

And in the latter case it was further held that the accused was not entitled to an acquittal, simply because the criminal act might have been committed in subordination to some irresistible impulse or inclination. This point was urged in behalf of the prisoner in that case, by the same learned counsel now reprerenting the present plaintiff in error, and it was answered by the court, in very plain language, as follows : “ Indulgence in evil passions weakens the restraining power of the will and conscience, and the rule suggested would be the cover for the commission of crime and its justification. The doctrine that a criminal act may be excused upon the notion of an irresistible impulse to commit it, where the offender has the ability to discover his legal and moral duty in respect to it, has no place in the law.” And the remark of an able English justice, that <em>“ </em>Every crime was committed under an influence of such a description. and the object of the law was to compel people to control these influences,” was repeated with approval. <em><a href="/ny/52/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="52 N.Y. 467" data-case-ids="510994" data-case-paths="/ny/52/0467-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/ny/52/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="52 N.Y. 467" data-case-ids="510994" data-case-paths="/ny/52/0467-01">470</a>. In Reg. <em>v. </em>Haynes, 1 <em>Foster &amp; F. </em>666, this subject was further considered, and it was there observed that <em>“ </em>if an influence he so powerful as to be termed irresistible, so much the more reason is there why we should not withdraw any of the safeguards tending to counteract it. There are three powerful restraints existing, all tending to the assistance of the person who is suffering under such an influence : the restraint of religion, the restraint of conscience, and the restraint of the law. But if the influence itself be held to be a legal excuse, rendering the crime dispunishable, you at once withdraw a most powerful restraint, that forbidding and punishing its perpetration. We "must, therefore, return to the simple question : <em>1 </em>Did the prisoner know the nature of the act he was doing, and did he know he was doing what. was wrong <em>í ’ </em>” <em>(Id. </em>667). These principles present the gist and substance of the law upon these subjects. They have been discussed in very many other instances, and concurring in the same conclusions. For that reason, particular, reference <em>to </em>them is at the pz’esent time not necessary. To a gz-eat extent, they are considered in the charge of Mr. Justice Brady, to which concurrence and approval may very properly be given. For the reasons assigned <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>by-'him, and those suggested by Presiding Justice .Davis, and maintained in such plain langnáge as to preclude the possibility of misapprehension on the occasions just referred to, this conviction should be affirmed.</p>

On the question of the burden of proof after evidence has been given by the accused tending to show insanity, the learned recorder had given to* the jury, in Ills charge, the true rule apjffic-able to a ease of the kind when it comes upon all the evidence to be submitted to the jury, and having done this, it was no error to refuse to submit upon the part of the prisoner a proposition which, if correct in itself, was only calculated to confuse the jury by distracting their attention from the real question which, upon the whole evidence, had already been correctly submitted to them. The recorder committed no legal error in refusing to charge as requested, in the fortín presented by the counsel for the prisoner. I concur, therefore, in the affirmance.</p>
