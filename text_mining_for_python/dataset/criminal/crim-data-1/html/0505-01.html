The absence of counsel was practically defendant’s absence, for he understood the English language only imperfectly, and did not know what the unexpected conversation between the judge and jury meant. Defendant was certainly injured, for the direct result was, that he was convicted of murder in the first degree. As a prisoner is not ordinarily capable of enforcing his legal rights, the law declares that, in addition to his presence, an opportunity shall be given for his counsel to be heard.

The court erred in refusing to inform the jury of the punishment for murder in the second decree, it being one of the offenses of which defendant might have been convicted. <em>Code Crim.

It is the right of the jury, in civil cases, to know the consequences of their verdict (Elliott <em>v. </em>Brown, 2 <em>Wen. </em>497; Holton <em>v. </em>Mosses, <a href="/barb/3/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Barb. 31" data-case-ids="8592075" data-case-paths="/barb/3/0031-01">3 <em>Barb. </em>31</a>; Waffle <em>v. </em>Dillenback, <a href="/ny/38/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="38 N.Y. 53" data-case-ids="500835" data-case-paths="/ny/38/0053-01">38 <em>N.

It is concededly the right of the accused to have the jury informed of the definition, meaning, nature, and grade of any offense of which he may be convicted (Foster <em>v. </em>People, <a href="/ny/50/0598-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="50 N.Y. 598" data-case-ids="2059723" data-case-paths="/ny/50/0598-01">50 <em>N.

After the case had been given to the jury, and they had retired, and after deliberating upon the evidence, the jury requested further instructions. The prisoner <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>was "brought into court, and the jury were recalled. The counsel who represented the prisoner were not notified of the request of the jury, or of their recall for further instructions, and they were not, in fact, in court.

'JSTecessarily there was no exception to this course, as the counsel were absent; but upon appeal it must be passed upon whether or not the refusal was right.

    <p id="b531-5" data-blocks='[["BL_531.5",531,[133,1238,1154,530]]]'>We think it was an absolute right of the prisoner to have his counsel notified after the jury returned into court, and before they were instructed. The words of the statute <em>(Code Crim.

In the present case it is apparent that the counsel for the accused might have induced the court to furnish the information sought, as there can be no doubt but that it Was within the discretionary power of the court, even if it was not a legal right. We think the information should have been given. In all cases the jury should know the effect of their verdict. While it is proper to instruct them that When a crime is proven the extent of the punishment therefore is no sufficient reason why a verdict according to the facts found should not be rendered ; yet, as part of the case, the punishment should be known by the <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>jury.
