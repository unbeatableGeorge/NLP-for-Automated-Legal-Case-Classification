By that section, the burning of any building <em>“ </em>which shall be at that time insured against loss or damage by fire, with intent to prejudice such insurance . . .” shall be arson in the third degree.

The case differs from People <em>v. </em>Henderson (1 <em>Park. </em>563), as in that case the intent to defraud the Poughkeepsie Mutual Insurance was averred, but it was not averred that the house burned was insured. It is clear that the indictment before us alleges a corporation duly organized, and empowered to take insurance, and that it was that corporation the prisoners intended to prejudice and injure. In Cohen <em>v. </em>People (5 <em>Park. </em>330), the indictment, after stating the corporation injured, said, viz.: “ A corporation created by and existing under the laws of the State of Massachusetts.” The objection, which was sustained by the court, was that there was no evidence proving the existence of the corporation alleged.</p>

The fire was on February 19, 1879, and Clark says, a. few days before it occurred an agreement was come to between him and Carncross and Cota that the building should be rifled and burned; that Carncross would give each of them <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>$200 for doing the job. The principal direct evidence tending to establish the conspiracy or plot to burn the building was given by Clark, the accomplice. The People called David. Carncross, who was a cousin of the defendant Carncross, who had had difficulty with him, and he was allowed to testify, against objection and exception, that in 1875, 1876, he had a conversation with defendant Carncross “ in regard to putting a stock of furniture in ” the building, and that defendant Carncross said <em>“ </em>he thought it would be <em>&amp; profitable investment </em>to put in furniture; he said “ it could be bought very cheap in the rough, and be stained and varnished.” We had several conversations in regard to it. . . . He came in, one day, and said to me, “ I will tell you how some money might be made,” (here was an objection and exception) and witness was allowed to say, viz. : <em>“ </em>He said we might stock up this building with furniture, build up a good fire, and go a-visiting. I told him I thought it would hardly do. I don’t remember anything further. I think this was in April, 1875.”</p>
