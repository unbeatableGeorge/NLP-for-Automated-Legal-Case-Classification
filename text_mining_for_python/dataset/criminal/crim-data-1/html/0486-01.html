The same rules of evidence are applicable to such trial of a challenge as apply to the trial of “ other issues.” <em>Code Crim. Pro. </em>§ 384.</p>

It is general when the objection is that the juror is “disqualified from serving in any case,” or, secondly, it may be •“ particular, that he is disqualified from serving in the case on trial.” § 375.</p>

That section sets down a rule for determining the question presented here, and we must consider the second subdivision of the section, which is as follows, viz.: “Second. For the existence of a state of mind on the part of a juror, in reference to the case or either party, which satisfies the court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, that such juror cannot try the issues impartially and without prejudice to the substantial rights of the party challenging, and which is known in this Code as actual bias.”......</p>

That portion of the section reads, viz.: “ But the previous expression or f ormation of an opinion or impression in reference thereto is not a sufficient ground of challenge for actual bias, to any person, otherwise legally qualified, if he declares on oath that he believes that such opinion or impression will not influence his verdict, and that he can render an impartial verdict according to the evidence, and the court is satisfied that he does not entertain such present opinion or impression as would influence his verdict.”</p>

He was fifty-eight years of age, and he read an account of it in the “ <em>Journal and </em>Courier,” published at Little Falls. When asked if he had read the evidence as published in that paper, or what purported to be the evidence, he answered, “ I am rather inclined to think I did ; could not be positive.” He had read the editorial comments, though he could recollect no “ particulars about it.” He said he formed an opinion, and it would take evidence to remove it, and he would not go into the-jury-box with a mind free from prejudice, free from opinion ; and he said, “ I don’t know as I should require a great deal of preponderance of evidence on the part of the prisoner to remove my impressions, but I should require some.” Later on in his testimony, he was asked, viz. : “ If you were accepted as a juror in the case, and the oath administered to you, and you took your seat in the box, would yon lay aside and leave any former impression you may have had upon the subject and receive the evidence and act impartially ?” His answer was, viz.: “ That is what I would act upon wholly.” Again, he was asked, viz.: “As a juror you would act entirely upon the evidence which was produced here upon the trial?” His answer was, viz.: “ Yes, sir;” and he added, he thought no information or impression which he had gained would influence him in any particular in his action as a juror. Some other statements appear in his evidence in respect to the impression made by reading the newspaper, and he stated that he understood that when he got i» the jury-box he would be controlled, by the evidence entirely. He y^as quite as well qualified as the juror Toplitz in People <em>V. </em>Oyer and Terminer, referred to in the opinion of Finch, J., <a href="/citations/?q=83%20N.Y.%20457" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="83 N.Y. 457">83 <em>N.
