Upon the merits we think the evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction. The statute (Code Crim. Proc. § 899, subd. 4 and 7) defines disorderly persons, and among the persons so defined, are keepers of houses for the resort of gamesters, and persons who keep in a public place an apparatus or device for the purpose of gaming. The evidence shows that the defendant kept a public saloon, to which persons resorted for the purpose of playing a game called pool, and another game called bagatelle.</p>
    <p id="b203-4" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[169,862,1157,377]]]'>These games were sometimes played upon the terms that the loser of the game should pay for the use of the gaming apparatus ; but, at other times, the players played for drinks. The house of the defendant, as appears, was kept principally for those purposes. Such a house is a public nuisance at common law (Tanner <em>v. </em>Trustees of Albion, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Hill%2C%20121" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Hill, 121">5 <em>Hill, </em>121</a>), and persons who resort there are gamesters, within the definition of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>

Y. </em>456</a>), the Court of Appeals held that, playing games for beer or cigars, was gambling, within the meaning of chapter 504 of the Laws of 1851, which prohibited the keeping of a room, etc., to be used for gambling.</p>
