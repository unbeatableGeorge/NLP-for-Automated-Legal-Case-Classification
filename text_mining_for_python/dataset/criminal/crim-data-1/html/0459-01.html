    <p id="b484-7" data-blocks='[["BL_484.7",484,[369,1600,1157,632]]]'>The evidence on behalf of the prosecution showed that defendant, a dealer in oils, had at divers times sold to one Delano, a retail grocer, in the course of his business, kerosene oil claimed to be below the standard degree; that said grocer had retailed it to his customers; that a certain instrument for testing oils under said act had been prescribed by the State Board of Health. The analyst of the said board for the western district of Hew York (S. A. lattimer, Prof, of Chemistry, Boehester University), testified that he had tested samples of the oil so sold, with the prescribed instrument, and found that the samples flashed at from <em>11 </em>degrees to 94 degrees. It also appeared that the oil sold was not naphtha, or other light product of petroleum, to be used in accord anoe with § 4 of the act.</p>
