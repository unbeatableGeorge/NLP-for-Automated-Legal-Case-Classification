In the circumstantial evidence relied upon by the people to implicate the accused and corroborate the accomplice, is the testimony given for the purpose of establishing that William Oortright was seen at the time and place narrated, by Martin Teeter. It appears by this witness’ evidence that he said, viz.: “ I cannot swear that this man was Oortright ” whom he met. “ I don’t know whether it was he or not.” When the witness , was asked if - he had an impression who it was, the defendant’s counsel objected' to it as incompetent. The objection was overruled, and the defendant excepted. The witness was permitted to answer, viz.: “1 don’t know for certain, only whom I thought it was; I thought it was William Oortright, but I don’t know. I had known him for a number of years and seen him frequently.” After this ruling, the district attorney propounded the following question, viz.: “ It was your impression at the time <em>% </em>” and the witness answered “ Yes. sir.” Following ' O this answer, the appeal book shows that the defendant asked to have the testimony of this “ witness about passing this man stricken out; ” and that the court refused and the defendant took an exception. In these several rulings occurring in the testimony of this witness Teeter, we think there was error. First, it expressly appears by the testimony that the witness was not able to identify positively or upon knowledge the <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>person lie met as that of William Cortright. The most that he could say was that he had an impression who it was, and that he “ thought it was William Cortright.” We are of the opinion that such impression and such <em>“ </em>thought ” of the witness ought not to have been received, or, having been received, ought to. have been stricken out upon defendant’s motion. People <em>v. </em>Wilson, 3 <em>Parker Crim.. </em>206. Strong, J., says, in the case last cited, <em>“ </em>Ordinarily the question of identity is one of fact, and a witness may be asked whether he knows a pai-ticular individual, and if so whether he is the person indicated. But the question put to this witness is not the ordinary one of identity. It calls for an opinion relative to a body which, if that of the deceased, had been submerged in salt water for upward of five months, and had undergone many changes. The witness can only state a conclusion drawn from the points of resemblance mentioned by him. The jury have heard his statements, and it is for .them, and not the witness to decide whether the body was that of the deceased captain.. The question must be rejected.”</p>

It appears to us the rule was departed from in receiving and retaining the testimony of the witness, Teeter. We cannot say -this erroneous evidence was not prejudieal to the rights of the accused. We are not able to say that it had no influence in producing the verdict rendered against the accused; nor can we say that “ if his evidence was struck from the case the proof of defendant’s guilt would be clear and overwhelmingand we can say therefore, that the rule, found in the Gonzalez case, is not applicable.

If this request was being considered under the rule, which obtained before that laid down in section 527 <em>(supra) </em>perhaps it would be a good answer to say that the request was too broad; that it called upon the court to repeat what had already been stated, as we have seen, in the questions we have made in the body of the charge.</p>

The court might in response to that part of the request well and properly have said, that the rule described in section 399 required that the testimony of the accomplice should be corroborated in'material points; and secondly, that it should be corroborated in respect to such matters as legitimately tended to establish that the accused was connected with the crime, and that in establishing such connection with the crime, it was incumbent upon the people to give such evidence as legitimately and naturally carried conviction to the minds of the jury, that the accused was connected with and was guilty of the offence charged ; and that such evidence “ as merely raised the suspicion of guilt ” was insufficient to satisfy the requirements laid down in section 399. There is a wide difference between evidence which tends to satisfy an intelligent jury that the accused has perpetrated a crime and such evidence as merely tends to raise in the mind of the jury “ a suspicion of guilt.” "We are of the opinion that such instructions as were requested ought to have been given by the learned trial judge to the jury in this case.
