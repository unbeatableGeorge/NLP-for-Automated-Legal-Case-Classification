Upon the defense, the defendant’s counsel offered to show by the defendant that during the term of court the defendant was seriously ill, and that “ Dr. Bay stated to him at that time that it would endanger his life to leave his room and come down here,” meaning Warsaw, the place of trial. This was- objected to, the objection was sustained, and exception taken by the defendant’s counsel. Witness also testified that he was advised that the court at which he was to be tried, and which he did not attend, had been adjourned. <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>The question was then asked, “ Were you requested to be at the adjourned term?” This was objected to, the objection sustained, and exception taken by the defendant.
