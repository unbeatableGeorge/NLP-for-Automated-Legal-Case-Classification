The mayor and comptroller thereupon caused to be printed one hundred and twenty-five bonds of $1,000 each, with interest coupons attached, dated September 1, 1875, purporting to be bonds of the city of Buffalo, authorized by chapter 680 of the Laws of 1871, payable to bearer, the principal at thirty-two years. The bonds were duly executed by the mayor and comptroller under the seal of the city, and deposited with the comptroller. The comptroller, on or about the 20th day of September, 1875, delivered to Bork seventy-five of the bonds, to be sold by him on account of the city. Bork sent them through a bank in Buffalo to a bank in the city of New York, subject to his order. He went to New York the same day, received the bonds from the bank there, and put them in the hands of one Moran, a broker in that city, the correspondent of Lyon <em>&amp; </em>Co., with directions to sell the bonds and credit the proceeds of sale of twelve of the bonds to Lyon &amp; Co., on their account with Moran, and to deposit the proceeds of sale of the remaining sixty-three bonds in the Bank of New York, to the credit of the Bank of Commerce of Buffalo, one of the deposit banks designated by the Common Council of Buffalo for the deposit of city funds. The bonds were sold by Moran, who deposited the proceeds as directed, by crediting the account of Lyon &amp; Co. $12,768.00, the proceeds of twelve of the bonds, and depositing to the credit of the Bank of Commerce $67,252.50, the proceeds of the remaining sixty-three bonds, which sum the Bank of Com<a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>merce, on being advised, credited ' to the account of Bork, the treasurer.

Bork "made no entry in the treasurer’s books of the sale of the bonds. He neither charged himself with the bonds nor credited the city with the proceeds. The credit in the Bank of Commerce did not disclose the source from which it was derived. The delivery of the bonds by the comptroller to Bork for sale was in accordance with the general custom in respect to bonds issued by the city during the incumbency of Bork. The' city during that period had issued bonds to the amount of one or two millions of dollars for various purposes, and a large part of them had been negotiated by Bork, they having been placed in the hands of the comptroller for that purpose.</p>
