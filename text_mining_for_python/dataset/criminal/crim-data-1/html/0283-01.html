    <p id="b309-4" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[174,547,1161,782]]]'>It is claimed by the appellant that by virtue of section 527 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this court has the power to review the case upen the facts, and if upon such review it finds that the verdict was either against the weight of evidence, or against law, or that justice requires a new trial, such trial should be directed, although no exceptions were taken in the court below. We are of the opinion that this section does not apply to appeals to this court. It is contained in chapter 1 of title 11 of the Code, which embraces seventeen sections; some of which treat exclusively of appeals to the Supreme Court, and others of appeals to this court, while still others apply indiscriminately to appeals to both. Section 527 is entitled “Stay of proceedings on appeal to Supreme Court from judgment of conviction ; new trial when granted,” and contains not only the provisions in question, but also others made applicable to the Supreme Court alone.</p>

    <p id="b309-7" data-blocks='[["BL_309.7",309,[175,1576,1161,484]]]'>Section 527 is nowhere made expressly applicable to this court, and the provision for a review upon the facts being confined to that section and omitted from the section expressly treating of appeals to this court, forbids the inference that it was intended to ¡De applicable to the Court of Appeals.

Pro. </em>§ 962. We should have been more reluctant in arriving at the conclusion that we had no power to review the facts in a criminal case, if a perusal of the evidence given upon this trial had left any doubt in our minds as to the justice of the result attained in the court below.</p>
    <p id="b310-4" data-blocks='[["BL_310.4",310,[304,896,1160,240]]]'>That evidence tended to prove a homicide committed under circumstances showing a wanton disregard of the sanctity of human life, and the obligations of care and protection which, as master of a household, the defendant owed to those belonging to his family circle;</p>
    <p id="b310-5" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[304,1141,1158,230]]]'>The evidence tended to show that he was a person of idle and dissolute habits, and regardless of the feelings or interests of others. ,On the day of the homicide, he visited the rooms occupied by himself and family at about noon, and requested his wife to wash his feet.</p>

    <p id="b310-7" data-blocks='[["BL_310.7",310,[302,1583,1159,377]]]'>The defendant replied to this remark with some profanity, and with apparent anger. He soon- thereafter left the house and having pledged his Coat to purchase a pistol, loaded it, and returned to the house where the deceased was employed in her work ; soon after entering the room where the deceased and his wife were sitting, he fatally shot the deceased with the pistol he had just purchased and loaded, and then tried to conceal himself under the bed.</p>
    <p id="b310-8" data-blocks='[["BL_310.8",310,[301,1976,1159,287]]]'>The conduct of the defendant immediately after the shooting, was marked with great levity and indifference, and his conversation immediately thereafter indicated that the act of shooting was intentional and premeditated. We cannot doubt that the jury arrived at a correct result upon the evidence, and we feel no disposition to interfere with their verdict.</p>
    <p id="b310-9" data-blocks='[["BL_310.9",310,[365,2268,1093,45]],["BL_311.1",311,[153,403,1161,233]]]'>We have not omittel to observe, that a week after the trial, <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>when the defendant was brought before the court for sentence, his counsel moved for a new trial upon the evidence, and for an alleged error in the charge to the jury, and upon the refusal of the court to grant a new trial, took an exception to such refusal.</p>
