The evidence discloses the fact that the wife was hostile to her husband, and would not have willingly testified to anything in his favor. The principle of law that the failure to produce a material witness to an occurrence in the power of a party to produce, is a circumstance that can be argued against him, does not apply to witnesses whose competency to become such depends upon their own option. It is submitted that the words of the statute “ may be examined ” are simply permissive, ail’d it was optional with the wife whether she would become a witness or not. The evidence in the case discloses the fact that the defendant’s wife would not have been a willing witness for him, and, without her consent, it was impossible for the defendant to put her upon the witness stand. The competency of a wife, as a witness, depends upon her willingness to testify, without the slightest power on the part of her husband desiring the testimony, or of the court or of the law to interfere or to have a word on the subject (22 <em>Alb.

The statute is not satisfied unless the intention was deliberated upon.

At the time of the killing the deceased and the appellant occupied different apartments on the same floor of a boarding-house, situate at No. 273 West Thirty-eighth street, in this city. On the night preceding the homicide the deceased took from the defendant a pistol which he was in the habit of carrying, and hid it. At this time his child, who was an infant, was seriously ill with the scarlet fever.</p>

This occurred about twenty-five minutes after his return. He then went out into the hallway connected with the room, where he was seen by another sister of his wife,—namely Sophia McCullough,—who having been called as a witness testified that having heard the shot she asked him what he had done ; to which he responded, “Nothing,” although the pistol was still in his hand. She further testified that he then went into her sister’s room again, and she ordered him out; whereupon he went across the hall to his own room where his sick child was lying. The witness then requested him not to touch the baby; to which he responded, alluding to the witness, “ You little son of a bitch, if you don’t get out of this room I will kill yon too.”</p>

This was at a moment when the deceased was “just departing,” to use the language of the witness, and he was in the custody of the officer—indeed had walked over the dead feet of the deceased, as the witness stated.

It will have been observed from this statement of the case that no witness was called who saw the shooting, except the defendant, who committed the deed, and therefore the importance of the circumstances mentioned must impress itself at once upon' the mind upon the question of premeditation and deliberation, which were necessary elements to establish the guilt of the appellant to the extent pronounced by the verdict herein.</p>

It is true he says he was in the habit of giving her his pistol at night, and this necessarily involved the ceremony of returning it to him upon the following day; but on this occasion the pistol was not returned, it was hid. It is a slight circumstance, it is true, but unfortunately for the viciously inclined, the history of crime shows that violent deeds are sometimes committed upon very slight provocation.</p>

The deceased reminded him of that fact by saying, “ Eddie, you ought to have more thought for your dying baby,” an observation with which he was evidently displeased, because, as we have already seen, his answer was, “ You are getting too God damned high-toned.” The hiding of the pistol and the observation of the deceased appear to have been proper in themselves, and not calculated to produce very great excitement. They seem, however, to have aroused within him a malevolent sentiment, a passion for revenge, which was to be appeased only by slaughter. Unless we accept his story that the shooting was accidental, no other view can be taken of the occurrence.</p>

It is proper to observe here, that there is no evidence in the case, showing that he was engaged in a calling which required such a weapon for his protection, or that he was in imminent danger in any respect, and, therefore, the loading of the pistol in the pawnbroker’s shop, marked by the preceding circumstances to which reference has been made, must have been with an object, and that object was the killing of the deceased, and was carried into execution within a few hours after the purchase of the pistol. ■ The causes which led to the act are trivial, it is true, when judged by the ordinary standard of human action, but in a bad-tempered man, a person easily excited, quickly inflamed, destitute of a decent sense of propriety, and more particularly if a criminal by habit, they might be, and indeed in this case seem to have been, quite sufficient to instigate the crime of which the defendant was convicted. That he was a criminal by habit, or, if the word habit is not justifiable, that he was a criminal at all events, is shown by his cross-examination, for, when he was .asked how often he had been in prison, he said three times, and each time for stealing.</p>

He failed, to call her to corroborate, if she could do so, his statement as to the shooting being accidental. It is impossible for us to say, therefore, under all the facts and circumstances to which reference has been made, that the jury were not entirely justified in finding the prisoner guilty of murder in the first degree—premeditated and deliberate murder.</p>

The people claim, however, and the uncontradicted evidence established that there was another eye-witness to this occurrence, namely, the wife of the defendant. You remember when the wife was offered as a witness, on behalf of the people, the court would not allow her to be examined as a witness against her husband, for in my judgment, the law does not permit it, but while that is so, the law does allow the wife to be a <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>witness in her husband’s behalf, and the people claim, that inasmuch as it appeared in evidence, that she was an eye-witness to the occurrence, accessible to the defendant, and the defendant allowed by the law to call her as his witness, and having neglected to do so, that that is a circumstance which the jury have a right to consider, on coming to a conclusion. And the people claim, moreover, that the prisoner’s omission to call her as witness under the above circumstances, should be taken as a matter of evidence against him, and they claim that the fair presumption is, that if she was called, her testimony would not be favorable to the defendant.”</p>

Upon the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence; and, Secondly. That there was not sufficient evidence in the case to show that the act was the result of a premeditated and deliberate design to effect death. And the counsel for the defendant, in connection with these two grounds, urged the error which it was alleged had been committed by the learned judge presiding, in making the observations which have been quoted. The application was made under section 527 of the Code, which provides that in cases of this character, tried in the Court of General Sessions, the appellate court may order a new trial, if it be satisfied that the verdict against the prisoner is against the weight of evidence, or against law, or that justice requires a new trial, whether any exceptions shall have been taken or not in the court below. In the consideration of this case, the appellant should, therefore, be given the full benefit of this section.</p>

It will have been perceived, that in .commenting upon this circumstance, the learned judge merely repeated the claim made on behalf of the people,namely, that the prisoner’s omission to call her as a witness, under the circumstances disclosed in the charge, should be taken as matter of evidence against him; that the fair presumption was, that, had she been called, her testimony would not have been favorable to him. It was not asserted as a conclusion of law, that such a result must follow, or that such must be the consideration given to the circumstance by the jury, but a state-' ment, merely, of the claim put forth by the prosecution of the argument on behalf of the people—that the omission was one which should be regarded by the jury as prejudicial to the pris-' oner. The facts affecting it are, that his wife was in court, and ..that she was called as a witness by the prosecution, but excluded upon the objection of the prisoner’s counsel. It seems to have been conceded that she was present at the time of the shooting, and, therefore, could have stated the circumstances attending the act. The charge is clearly within the rule of law as enunciated by the adjudged cases.</p>

The absence of such evidence, the court said, especially when it seems to be in the power of the prisoner to furnish it, creates a strong presumption of his guilt, a strong inference against him, and is a circumstance greatly corroborative of the truth of the evidence given upon the other side, and, in a doubtful case, would justify the jury in resolving the doubt against him.</p>

This view is predicated of this language of the section: <em>“ </em>In all criminal trials and examinations before trial, a husband or wife <em>may </em>be examined as a witness on behalf of the other,”—but it is clearly erroneous. The legislature meant to confer, and did so, upon the husband the privilege, in a criminal proceeding against' him, of calling his wife as a witness, if he chose to do so—not to give her any other right than to call him, if she chose to do so, under similar circumstances. She could not decline to become a witness, or exercise any option in regard to it. If called by him she must respond, or be punished for contempt. It is the husband’s right to call her, and as well the wife’s right to call him, by the same section. They may be witnesses, if the right thus conferred is exercised by either, but cannot be compelled to testify against each other, at the call of any other person hostile to either.
