But the established rule of the common law has been materially changed by the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 399, as it stood at the time of the trial, enacted <em>“ </em>that a conviction can not be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless he be corroborated by such other evidence as tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime,” <em>“ </em>and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the crime or the <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>circumstances thereof.” A more complete shield for certain classes of crimes which must always invariably be proved by accomplices, if at all, could not well be devised; for the corroboration, however strong in all other respects, must point to the connection of the defendant with the commission of the crime, to be of any avail. And in those secret crimes where usually the only witness to the connection of the defendant with the actual commission of the crime, is of necessity an accomplice, convictions will fail, however clearly the body of the crime is shown by additional evidence, becausé the witness, though fully corroborated in other respects, may not be corroborated in the designation of the person who committed the secret offense. But the law as declared by the Code must be accepted and applied by the courts. It is our duty, therefore, to see whether in the strong corroboration of the accomplice in this case in other respects, there is any corroborating testimony which tends to connect the appellant with the commission of the forgery.</p>

Demurest &amp; Duncan, upon their bank in this city; that the check was soon afterwards altered by erasing the name “ Georgiana Mace” and inserting the name <em>“ </em>George S.

These facts were abundantly proved without the testimony of the accomplice. They constituted the body of the crime. The accomplice also gave testimony, sufficient, if believed, to show these several facts, and to prove also that himself and the several persons named in the indictment were connected with the commission of the forgery, and shared in different proportions in its proceeds. The question was thus presented to the court whether any of the evidence outside of that given by the accomplice tended to connect the appellant with the forgery.. It was proved by Mr. Duncan, one of the firm of Demarest &amp; Duncan, that the appellant came to their store in the evening of April 20, ánd said she wished to <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>purchase a check, as the post-office was closed up, to send $6 to her sister or mother i-ir Philadelphia; and it would accommodate her very much to get it off that evening; that he thereupon drew the check and gave it to her, and received $6 from her: and that the check was the same that had been altered. It was then proved by the paying teller of the bank, . that the check was presented in its altered condition on April 22, and paid to the person who presented it, who is also one of the indictees. Then followed the testimony of the accomplice, showing the arrangement to get the check ; its procurement, by the appellant; its alteration by her husband- at her house ; and the subsequent obtaining of, and the division of the money, of which the appellant received the largest share.</p>

They connected her with the check under very suspicious circumstances, from which, if unexplained, a fair inference grows that she was connected with the forgery, and therefore they were in some degree, corroborating evidence of the character required by the Code. The section of the Code referred to does not require positive, or direct or conclusive evidence. It need only “ tend to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.” Unexplained, the tendency of the evidence was to show that the check was obtained by the appellant in person upon a false pretext, and for a pretended use to which it was not put, and that, instead of being sent to Philadelphia, it was altered, and raised, and the money obtained on it within so short a time after it was obtained, as almost to preclude the possibility of its having been sent to that city; and although this alone might not justify the conviction, yet, taken with the evidence <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>given by the accomplice of her presence at the commission of the forgery, and her sharing in its fruits, it presented a case proper to be sent to the jury, especially after her own examination had failed to explain or contradict some of the important circumstances.</p>
