Therefore, according to the relator’s argument, a punishment is specially prescribed for every misdemeanor. Now, therefore, every misdemeanor is excepted from section 15 of the Penal Code. This, plainly, is unreasonable. Again, the definitions of larceny in the Penal Code are unlike those in the Revised Statutes. Therefore, that part of section 1 (m. p. 690), 2 R. S., which defines petit larceny is not in force. Why, then, the residue of the section ? The relator’s position, if correct, would seem to apply' to some, perhaps many, other cases. Eor instance, section 651, Penal Code, declares certain interferences with gas pipes to be a misdemeanor, but prescribes no penalty. This section is substantially the act of 1854, chapter 109, sections 1 and 2, by which the crime was declared and a penalty prescribed of six months’ imprisonment and afine of §250. Are we, then, to understand that a violation of section 651 is not punishable under section 15 of the Penal Code, because there was a penalty in the act of 1854, and that in the absence of an express repeal of that act, the provisions therein are still in force ?
