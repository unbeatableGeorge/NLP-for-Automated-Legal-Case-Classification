But the cause did not require this evidence for that purpose, for it Avas entirely apparent that the persons who entered the place of the complaining witness and robbed him of his money, intended to commit precisely that crime. But even if the evidence might have been pertinent on the question of intent, it Avas neither offered nor received on that theory. The ruling of the court, under which it was permitted to be given, was expressed in the following language: The Court : “ I shall charge the jury that the fact, if it be a fact, that Ware committed another offense on the 19th day of October, is no evidence whatever tending to prove that he committed the offense charged in the indictment, but that they may <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>take that circumstance—that is, the contradiction between him and this witness, as I assume it is going to be a contradiction— into consideration upon the question of the defendant’s credibility as a witness.

    <p id="b195-4" data-blocks='[["BL_195.4",195,[205,583,1164,1311]]]'>And from that it is clear that the evidence was received for the mere purpose of contradicting and discrediting the defendant.as a witness in the case. Whether he participated in the commission of the other offense was not a material inquiry on the trial of this indictment. It was simply collateral, and the object of it was by cross-examination to show such preceding criminal conduct on the part of the defendant as would lead the jury to disbelieve the witness or to reduce the effect they might otherwise be inclined to give to his testimony. When that course of cross-examination has been followed, the law does not permit the party adopting it to introduce further and independent evidence to .prove that the denial of the witness was false. When that is the sole effect to be given to the evidence, the party cross-examining the witness is concluded by his answer. The inquiry cannot be further extended by procuring testimony of a contradictory nature. The rule upon this subject has frequently been made a matter of consideration by the courts, and it is now well established that to entitle the party interrogating the witness in this manner, by way of cross-examination, to introduce evidence to contradict his statements, the cross-examination must be directed to a material inquiry in the case, or to evidence establishing a hostile or unfriendly bias, against the party, in the mind of the witnesses.
