216249,Kansas Gulf Short Line Railway Company v. M. C. Scott,1892-10-11,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellee brought this suit against appellant to recover damages, claiming that he had been wrongfully ejected from appellant’s train. The damages, which he claimed, were the amount of the fare from Wells, the station on appellant’s road, at which he was put off, to Tyler, the point of his destination; for'violence, insults, and indignities offered to him by the conductor in ejecting him; and the value of a pass, which he held, entitling him to ride over that road until December 31, 1908, and which, he claimed, was repudiated and rendered valueless by the action of appellant’s agents. Appellant pleaded a general denial, non est factum, and other facts, which will not be noticed further, as they are not involved in the points raised in this appeal.
Verdict was rendered for appellee for $250 for the ejection, and $1000 for the value of the pass.
During the trial, appellee, Scott, testified, that the road was ninety-eight miles long; that he intended to use the pass traveling over the road, as he passed over it frequently, getting lumber to use in building, in which business he was engaged sometime ago; that he had traveled over the road on the pass without paying; and that it would have been useful to him, if honored, until A. D. 1908.
Appellee resided at Tyler, one terminus of the road, and the fare from there to Lufkin, the other terminus, was $5.90. At this point appellee was asked: “ How many trips would you have probably made over defendant’s road, per year, had it not revoked the pass?” Appellant objected to this, that it sought for the opinion of the witness, and that the witness should state the facts, and leave the jury to draw the conclusion. The objection being overruled, the witness answered: “I would have, probably made ten trips per month.”
The court charged the jury, that in estimating the value of the pass, they should, among other things, consider the number of trips plaintiff would probably have made.
This evidence of Scott is all the evidence shown in the record affecting the value of the pass.
The ruling of the court admitting this evidence is the ground of appellant’s first assignment of error.
The court, in its charge, instructed the jury, that if the agents of defendant used abusive language or insults to plaintiff, or offered indignities to plaintiff’s person or character, he would be entitled to recover damages therefor. Appellant’s third assignment complains of this charge, because there was no evidence to warrant it.
Appellee, Scott, testified, that he got on the cars at Lufkin, and between there and Wells presented his pass to the conductor. The latter said that no such pass had ever been issued. Scott replied: “ That can not be so.” The conductor then said that the ticket had been scratched Scott insisted that the pass had been properly issued from the office; and the conductor again said: “ No, that pass is bogus; you will have to get off;” and threatened to put Scott off, unless he would get off voluntarily. Scott said that he would not get off, but would have to be put off, as he Was traveling on a good pass. The conductor waited until the train reached Wells, and then said to Scott, that he looked upon him (Scott) as a gentleman, and did not want to put him off. Scott again refused to get off; whereupon the conductor said he would take Scott by the arm and lead him off, which he did.
The conductor advised with two other employes of the railway company as to the validity of the pass, and they agreed with him that it was not good. This is- all the evidence there is tending to show any misconduct on the part of the conductor.
We are of the opinion that both of these rulings are erroneous. The question to Scott called for his opinion as to the number of trips he would probably have riiade in the future, had his pass remained in force,.and the proposed evidence is not embraced within any of the exceptions to the rule which excludes mere opinions of witnesses.
No reason is seen why the facts upon which such opinion as the subject inquired about admitted of, could not have been detailed by the witness to the jury; nor why the jury could not have formed the opinion, after hearing the facts, as well as the witness. When this is the case, opinion is not competent evidence. Clardy v. Callicoate, 24 Texas, 172; 1 Whart. Ev., sec. 513.
This evidence was well calculated to affect the verdict of the jury, inasmuch as the probable number of trips plaintiff would have made was to be considered by them in estimating the value of the pass, and there was little other evidence upon which they could base a verdict on this point.
The evidence as to the conduct of the conductor in putting appellee off the car was not, in our opinion, such as to warrant the charge complained of in third assignment. While his ejection of appellee may have been wrongful, it is apparent from the record that he used no “ abusive language or insults to plaintiff’s person or character.” His claim that the ticket was “ bogus” and had “ been scratched,” contained no charge against appellant; on the contrary, he seems to have disclaimed any such meaning by stating that he regarded appellant as a gentleman.
The jury probably inferred from the charge quoted that they were at liberty to consider the language and the conduct of the conductor as abusive or insulting.
For these errors the judgment must be reversed.
The second assignment of error, complaining of the exclusion of evidence offered by appellee, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments, attacking passages in the charge of the court, are not well taken. The exclusion of the proposed evidence was right, and the instructions referred to present correct rules of law for the guidance of the jury.
Several propositions are stated in appellant’s brief under his ninth assignment. That assignment of error attacks the verdict of the jury as allowing excessive damages. In view of the fact that the verdict was based, in part, upon improper testimony, and found under an erroneous instruction, no opinion we might express upon it could serve any useful purpose upon another trial. No complaint is made of the measure of damages given in the charge except that above pointed out.
Appellant, however, contends that inasmuch as the pass for twenty-five years was given appellee for an undivided one-half interest in land conveyed by him to the railway company, valued at the time at $2000, lie can not in this suit recover more than the value of his one-half interest in such land after deducting the benefits he had received in the use of the pass for five years.
Delivered October 11, 1892.
To this we can not assent. Whatever may have been the estimate put upon the land, he was entitled to the full value of that which he received in exchange for it, the ticket. ' If this was greater than the value of the land, he was entitled to the benefit of it. If he was wrongfully deprived by the acts of appellant of the use of the pass, before it expired, he was entitled to recover the value.
Of course if the pass was never issued for twenty-five years, but for five only, he would be entitled to nothing.
The rules given in the charge for determining the validity and effect of the pass are correct.
This disposes of the questions raised by appellant that are likely to occur on another trial.
Reversed and remanded."
216230,J. M. Luckey et al. v. C. B. Short,1892-10-11,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellee was elected county attorney of Shelby County at the election of 1890. On the Monday following the election the Commissioners Court met, canvassed the returns, estimated the results, and declared that appellee had been duty elected as county attorney. The county judge issued to him a proper certificate of his election. The court being still in session, appellee appeared before it with his bond and asked that it be approved. The court informed him that November 29 following had been fixed as the day when the court would assemble and consider bonds of all county officers, including his. He asked the members of the court if they had any objections to his sureties, and was informed that they had none. He then inquired if they objected to the form of the bond, to which they replied that “ they had not got to that yet.”
Appellee insisted that they act upon his bond, which they declined to do before November 29, unless the incumbent of the office consented. He declined to consent, and the court finalty refused to act upon the bond sooner than the time fixed.
Appellee thereupon brought suit before the District Court, then in session, for a mandamus to compel the commissioners and county judge to convene and approve or disapprove his bond.
After the notice to the county judge and commissioners, and a hearing, the court granted a peremptory mandamus, requiring them to assemble at a time fixed, as a court, and to approve or disapprove the bond. From this judgment they here prosecute their appeal.
The first proposition in appellant’s brief asserts that the District Court had no jurisdiction to grant the writ.
I. Because the amount in controversy was not sufficient.
2. Because the act sought to be enforced involved the exercise of judicial discretion committed by law to the county judge and Commissioners Court.
The amount in controversy does not control the jurisdiction in this case. Besides, the County Court in Shelby County has no civil jurisdiction.
The proposition that the calling together of the Commissioners Court and the acting upon'the bonds of officers involves the exercise of judicial power by the county judge and Commissioners Court, not subject to control by the District Court, does not raise a question of jurisdiction, but one as to proper exercise of power.
Delivered October 11, 1892.
We are not prepared to hold that the District Court would not have the power, in a proper case, to compel, by mandamus, the Commissioners Court to pass upon an official bond, which the law makes it their duty to approve or disapprove. And the question remains, were the facts presented in this case sufficient to warrant the exercise of this power ?
While it was made by law the duty of the Commissioners Court to approve the bond of the county attorney, no time is fixed at or within which this shall be done. Eev. Stats., art. 248.
We have not been able to find any provision fixing the time when the county attorney must qualify, and none is referred to in the briefs. The approval of the bond is required to be the act of the Commissioners Court. To act as a court, the commissioners must assemble from different parts of the county, at the place fixed by law for the holding of such court. They have many other duties to perform, and it is absolutely necessary that they be clothed with some discretion with regard to fixing the time for meeting and discharging them. So long as they are not shown to be abusing this discretion, by failing or refusing to do some act enjoined upon them by law, or by denying or withholding some right to which the law entitles a party, they should not be interfered with by mandamus.
In this case, all that is shown against them is their refusal to act uponappellee’s bond at the same session at which they canvassed the election returns, with the statement that they would act upon it at another day, which they had fixed for the consideration of bonds of county officers.
It does not appear that appellee was in any danger of losing his office by the delay; and while no reason is shown why the court might not have acted upon his bond when it was first presented, we can not say that any such apparent abuse of authority or exercise of unwarranted power on the part of the Commissioners Court is shown as to call for any explanation. The delay in getting possession of his office, to which appellee was forced to submit, must be treated as incident to the right of the court to set, within reasonable limits, the time when it will meet and perform its functions, when such time is not fixed by law.
This decides the only questions in the case which are necessary to a disposition of it. The judgment will be reversed, and judgment rendered here in favor of appellants.
Reversed and rendered."
216221,T. J. Todd et al. v. E. Roberts,1892-10-11,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
This suit was brought in Justice Court by appellee against appellant upon two drafts or bills of exchange drawn by appellant in favor of appellee on the Houston, East & West Texas Railway Company, payment of which had been refused by the drawee on presentation.
Appellant filed in the Justice Court a written plea under oath, alleging, in substance, that the drafts were given for tie timber purchased of appellee for the Houston, East & West Texas Railway; that it was understood between appellant and appellee, at the time the drafts were given, that appellant was not to be held liable upon them, but that appellee was to look to the railway company for payment; and that the drafts were intended only as memoranda or vouchers to show the amount due appellee from the compafiy for timber.
Exceptions to this plea were sustained in the Justice Court; and in the ■ District Court, to which the case was taken on appeal, the same ruling was made; this ruling forms the basis of the only complaint made in this court on appeal.
The ruling of the court below sustaining exceptions to the plea, was correct. The plea plainly sought to vary the written instruments sued on, by proof of parol contemporaneous agreement.
Delivered October 11, 1892.
By those instruments appellant agreed that the railway company would pay the amounts specified in them, and that if the company failed to do so, appellee would. Parol evidence was not admissible to show a different agreement. Rockmore v. Davenport, 14 Texas, 605. The judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed."
216279,"A. H. Cooper, Administrator, v. John H. Lee",1892-10-14,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
This suit was brought in the District Court of Harrison County on February 4, 1887, by the appellee, John H. Lee, to rescind a certain deed and recover of John T. Pierce a tract of land situated in Tarrant County. Pierce died after the institution of the suit, and the appellant, Cooper, became the administrator of his estate, with will annexed, and was made a party defendant to the suit. Annie L. Pierce, the widow, and John L. and Hope Pierce, the children,' and Mattie and Richard Godbold, also minors and devisees in the will, were also made defendants, and special guardians were appointed to represent said minors. The defendants Annie E. Pierce and her children disclaimed any interest in the land. This is the second appeal, and the first will be found reported in 75 Texas, 114.
After the former judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court the pleadings in the case were amended to meet the views of that court with reference to the question of limitation, and to excuse the plaintiff for his failure to bring his action within four years from the date of the execution of the deed.
Plaintiff’s amended petition charged substantially, that on the-day of November, 1881, plaintiff was the owner of a large and valuable tract of land in Tarrant County, Texas, which was described in an exhibit to the petition; that said John T. Pierce, on or about said day and date, came to plaintiff and represented to him that it would be greatly to his advantage to exchange said tract of land for another tract or tracts which he, the said Pierce, owned, and that plaintiff, influenced by said representations, and trusting said defendant on account of the relations existing between them, consented to said exchange, and about said date executed to said Pierce a deed for said land. That the sole consideration for the conveyance of said land to Pierce, was the other tracts of land mentioned, which defendant pretended to own, and for which he at the same time executed a deed to plaintiff. That plaintiff was the father-in-law of Pierce, and lived in Pierce’s house as a member of his family up to the time of his death. Pierce was an attorney at law, and as such acted in this, as in all other matters, for the plaintiff. On account of these confidential relations he reposed the utmost confidence in said Pierce. That both the deeds were prepared by Pierce or under his supervision, and that plaintiff, on account of the trust reposed by him in said Pierce, did not read the deed executed by the latter to him, and did not know the contents of the same.
That at the time of the execution of said deeds Pierce represented to plaintiff that it would be greatly to the interest of both parties not to record either of said deeds; that shortly after the execution of the deed from Pierce to plaintiff on or about May, 1884, said Pierce, knowing that plaintiff had not recorded his deed, called on plaintiff and requested him to let him (Pierce) see the deed, which plaintiff did, and delivered the same to Pierce; that Pierce had never returned said deed, but had refused to do so, and plaintiff had no means of ascertaining what lands had been conveyed thereby. Pierce, contrary to his representations and agreement, immediately placed on record in Tarrant County the deed which plaintiff had executed to him; that plaintiff was informed, and believed and averred, that Pierce had no title to the lands which he pretended to convey to plaintiff in exchange for the Tarrant County land, and that his intention was to defraud the plaintiff and obtain the deed from him without any consideration. Plaintiff did not claim, and had never, since he discovered Pierce’s fraudulent intent, claimed any right, title, or interest in the lands which Pierce pretended to convey to him, and renounced any and all right under said deed or deeds, by which Pierce pretended to convey to him said lands, and offered to reconvey the same to the administrator for the use of said Pierce’s estate. That plaintiff did not learn that Pierce would not return to him the deed, which he had obtained under the pretext of looking at it, until the-day of November, 1886, at which time he refused to return the same to plaintiff. Said deed was charged to be in the possession of the defendant or the administrator of Pierce’s estate, and notice was given to defendant to produce the sainé at the trial. Plaintiff averred that said Pierce, after he had obtained from plaintiff the possession of the deed or deeds, by which he had pretended to convey the lands to plaintiff, sold and conveyed said lands or a portion thereof, situated in Hill County, to Tarleton, Jordan & Tarleton, who were innocent purchasers, by which he defeated whatever title plaintiff may have acquired from him.
To this petition the defendant interposed a general demurrer, and excepted specially, in substance:
1. That if ever plaintiff had any cause of action, it had been barred by the statute of limitation.
2. The alleged reasons for not having sooner discovered the alleged fraud were not sufficient to excuse the plaintiff for not having brought his action within four years after the date of the deed.
a. Said amended petition showed no such facts of fraud, accident, or mistake, as would entitle plaintiff to his equitable action of rescission m the premises.
4. That it appeared from the petition that whatever cause of action plaintiff had, he was fully advised long before the institution of the suit, and as his action was not instituted within a reasonable time after the discovery of the alleged fraud, he should be held to have ratified the sale.
5. That plaintiff showed no reason why he did not take and use the ordinary legal diligence to protect his title to the lands, as he was by law required to do; that he was in nowise prompted by Pierce or any one else, but failed to do so by his own laches and negligence.
Defendants further answered by general denial, and a plea of not guilty, and pleaded specially to the statute of limitations; that the alleged fraudulent acts of Pierce by the exercise of ordinary diligence might have become known to Lee within one year thereafter; that plaintiff failed to act promptly and within a reasonable time to rescind the sale. Defendants also pleaded that the conveyance was made with the fraudulent intent to hinder, delay, and defraud the creditors of plaintiff, especially the beneficiaries in the bond of A. Pope as administrator of the estate of Rene Fitzpatrick, deceased, upon which plaintiff was one of the sureties; and that plaintiff ought not to be allowed to renounce and rescind said sale and recover back said land.
In reply to the answer of defendants, plaintiff filed a supplemental petition, alleging that at the time Pierce procured the deed from plaintiff for the Tarrant County land, he, as counsel for plaintiff, advised him to make such deed, representing to him that it would be greatly to his pecuniary advantage so to do, and in this way, as well as by the fact that Pierce was the son-in-law of plaintiff, who was then a member of his, said Pierce’s, family, plaintiff was induced to make said deed. That Pierce was plaintiff’s confidential adviser in all matters; was the agent of plaintiff and acted for him in all business matters, especially in rendering for taxation his property to the assessors, and paying taxes. He also had in his hands all the money and available claims and credits which belonged to plaintiff, and acted for plaintiff in everything; that said agency and attorneyship continued in full force during all the time up to November, 1886, and he did during all the said time all the acts required by his agency, especially assessing property and paying taxes, and he used all the advantages arising from his position to conceal from plaintiff his fraudulent design to defraud plaintiff and the fact that he had not title to said land.
That at said time Pierce had deliberately formed the design to defraud plaintiff by obtaining from him without consideration all of his property, and fraudulently represented that he owned the lands, which he pretended to give in exchange for the plaintiff’s lands, when, in truth and in fact, he did not own the same.
That plaintiff’s eyesight and memory were then impaired by age, and he had either not read the deed, or if he had read it, he had forgotten the fact, and could not state the contents thereof. Pierce had advised plaintiff not to record his deed, and relying on Pierce as his lawyer and sOn-in-law, he had failed to do so. That when, on May —, 1884, Pierce requested plaintiff to allow him to examine the deed, he fraudulently represented that he merely wanted to look over it, and deceitfully promised to return the same, but he really intended to possess himself of said deed, so that he might destroy or suppress the same, which he did.
That owing to the implicit confidence which the plaintiff reposed in said Pierce, he did not learn of his fraudulent design in reference to said land until the <— day of November, 1886, at which time said Pierce refused to return said deed to him. Plaintiff averred that he did not learn that Pierce had no title to the lands which he pretented to give in exchange for said Tarrant County land until long after his refusal to return said deed; that the lands which Pierce pretended to give in exchange were situated in a distant part of the State, and plaintiff had no access to. the title papers to the same, nor to the record of such papers, and that Pierce fraudulently withheld the fact that the title to his said lands was bad, and adroitly concealed, by false promises and many professions of honesty, his intention to suppress said deed, and keep the Tarrant County land; and the plaintiff, who was very old and without money, could not, by any diligence, discover the wrong which Pierce was meditating.
Trial was had by a jury, September 17, 1890, after the court had overruled the defendant’s demurrers; a verdict was returned for the plaintiff, and judgment was rendered in his favor, rescinding the deed and for the recovery of the land sued for; from which the present appeal has been taken, and a reversal thereof is sought upon numerous assignments of error, upon the action of the court in overruling the defendant’s demurrers, the admission and exclusion of evidence, and in giving and refusing charges. The facts, briefly stated, are:
John T. Pierce was the son-in-law of the appellee, John H. Lee. From the year 1875 to his death in 1888, Pierce was an attorney at law, and as such acted for Lee from 1881 to 1887. He was also Lee’s business.manager, gave in his property for taxes, paid taxes, brought suits, and gave Lee. advice. At the time of the trial in 1890, Lee was eighty-two years old, and his eyesight was defective, but he could see better in 1881. He was able to read and write. He lived during the time from 1881 to 1887 ’ with Pierce. Had property subject to taxation, but did not give it in or pay taxes on it. It does not appear that Lee owned any property other than that conveyed to him by Pierce in November, 1881, except a farm called the “ Smith place,” .the title to which stood in Pierce’s name, and for which this suit was also originally brought, and a tract in Jack County.
About November 1,1881, Pierce, by representations through his wife, procured a conveyance from Lee for the Tarrant County land, in exchange for lands which he conveyed to Lee, and which he represented to be more in quantity and far more valuable than that received from Lee.
Pierce prepared the deeds for the land and delivered Lee his. These deeds were:
1. Deed from John II. Lee to John T. Pierce for the land in controversy, dated November 1, 1881, acknowledged November 2, 1881, and recorded in Tarrant County January 24, 1882; consideration expressed, $2500.
2. Quitclaim deed, from John T. Pierce to John H. Lee, for an expressed consideration of $500, for all Pierce’s right, title, and interest in the O. P. Kelter one-third league in Harris County, as shown by deed of conveyance from heirs of Alexander McCown to Pierce. This deed was acknowledged by Pierce November 2, 1881. It appears to have come from the custody of defendants, and does not appear to have ever been recorded.
3. Deed from John T. Pierce to John H. Lee, dated November 1,1881, acknowledged November 2, 1881, for an expressed consideration of $2500, conveying an undivided one-half interest in and to three tracts of land in Hill County, fully described. This deed appears to have come from the custody of defendants, and does not appear to have ever been recorded..
It was shown that Pierce afterward, by his warranty deed, dated April 23, 1884, and recorded in Hill County July 14, 1884, conveyed to Tarlton, Jordan & Tarlton, for a consideration of $2000, the lands in that county before conveyed by him to Lee.
Lee testified that he did not know where the lands conveyed to him by Pierce were situated, and that he had never received anything from them.
Several months after the exchange of the lands Pierce asked Lee to let him see the deeds which he had given him. Lee handed them to Pierce, who looked at them and said, “ These-are the ones,” and carried them off. These deeds were never returned to Lee.
In the latter part of 1886 Lee asked Pierce for a settlement and a return of his deeds. Pierce refused to give up the deeds or make a settlement.
Lee was a surety on the bond of A. Pope, as administrator of the estate of Rene Fitzpatrick, in the sum of $2500, executed in 1867. Suit was instituted on said bond October 6,1881, and Lee was a party thereto. He had final judgment in his favor in November, 1885. If the suit had gone against Lee it would have been his financial ruin, as expressed by himself.-
On the former appeal of this case it was held, that if the transaction in which Pierce procured the conveyance from Lee was fraudulent, Lee would have a cause of action for its rescission growing out of the transaction itself, and that four years is the period prescribed by our statute within which such action shall be brought. 75 Texas, 121.
This, we think, disposes of the exception of defendants to the petition that the suit must be brought within a reasonable time from the date of the transaction, or from the discovery of the fraud, and that such reasonable time Was a question of law for the court to determine. In this case the appellee had four years within which to bring his suit from the date of the deed which he sought to rescind; or if he did not then immediately discover the fraud which he alleged had been practiced in securing said deed from him, then within four years from the time of the discovery of such fraud; provided, that it must be discovered within a reasonable time. What is a reasonable time would vary according to the facts and circumstances attending and subsequent to the transactions which, in their nature, tend to prevent a discovery of the fraud; and it would sometimes be a mixed question of law and of fact.
There was no error in submitting the question of . reasonable time to the jury, if the facts alleged in the petition are of such a nature as ought to excuse the plaintiff, Lee, from discovering the fraud, which, he alleged, had been practiced upon him by Pierce. We think the allegations were sufficient. As alleged in the petition, Lee was an old man, and resided with Pierce, who was his son-in-law; and, as an attorney-at-law, was his legal adviser, as well as his agent for the transaction of all his business. The deeds for the land were prepared by Pierce, and delivered to Lee with the advice not to record them. Relying on Pierce’s representations as to the deeds, and the value of the lands, and to pay taxes, there was no occasion for Lee to examine the deeds, or inquire after the lands. The time which elapsed from the date of the transaction until the suit was instituted, was about fifteen months more than the period of limitation. We are not prepared to say, as a matter of law, that this was not a reasonable time, and that the fraud should have been sooner discovered. Plaintiff’s petition also showed a good cause of action for the rescinding of the deed.
Defendant’s demurrer and exceptions, as presented in the first five assignments of error, were properly overruled.
On the trial m the court below, the defendants objected to the introduction in evidence, by the plaintiff, of the deed executed by Pierce to Tarlton, Jordan & Tarlton, April 24, 1884, for the Hill County land, because it was a transaction occurring long after the fraud practiced on Lee in 1881; was calculated to prejudice Lee with the jury; and was done long after the expiration of the time within which Lee should have discovered the fraud. The rule of evidence in cases of fraud is liberal, and justly so. In this case it was alleged that Pierce procured the conveyance of the Tarrant County lands in order to defraud the plaintiff; and that plaintiff had not received any value for them; that when Pierce delivered the deeds to Lee, he advised him not to record them, and, sometime afterward, induced Lee to return them to him. The evidence tended to show the fraudulent design of Pierce from the beginning as a culmination thereof, and was admissible for that purpose.
Appellants rely upon numerous assignments of error, which they have failed to copy in their brief, and which are objected to by appellee on that ground and others. These relate to the admission of evidence, and the refusal of the court to give special instructions requested by the defendants, and do not present any fundamental errors of law. Rule 29 of Supreme Court, in force when the brief of appellants was prepared, is as follows: “ The appellant, or plaintiff in error, in order to prepare properly a case for submission when called, shall have filed a brief of the points relied on, in accordance with and confined to the distinct specifications of error (which assignments shall be copied into the brief) and to such fundamental errors of law as are apparent upon the record, each ground of error being separately presented under the proper assignment; and each assignment not so copied and accompanied with its appropriate propositions and statements, shall be regarded as abandoned.”
This rule has been adopted recently by the Supreme Court as one of the rules for the Courts of Civil Appeals. Whether invoked by the appellee or not, we think that this and other rules should be enforced; and because they are not copied in the brief, as required by the rules, we will regard as abandoned the assignments from the seventh to the thirtieth, inclusive, and will not consider the same.
The thirty-first assignment of error is as follows: “ The court erred in the charge to the jury, specially in the following particulars: 1. Because it fails to instruct the jury that the burden of proving an excuse for Lee’s delay in bringing suits was on Lee. 2. Because it did not charge that the burden was on Lee to show that he had not been guilty of ordinary neglect in failing to discover before February 4, 1883, the fraud practiced by Pierce in obtaining from Lee the conveyance sought to be canceled. 3. Because the definition of ordinary diligence and care, as given in the charge, is incorrect as applied to this case and was misleading to the jury. 4. The charge gives improper directions as to how they should determine upon Lee’s excuse for failing to discover the fraud practiced in November, 1881, before the 4th of February, 1883, as the age, relationship, and condition of the parties would furnish no excuse for any lack of diligence on Lee’s part, and could only be considered by the jury in determining whether Pierce’s acts were sufficient to defeat ordinary diligence on Lee’s part for a year, three months, and three days.”
The first and second particulars in the assignment relate to omissions in the charge, which should have been corrected by appropriate instructions requested by the defendants, and the omission to charge on the burden of proof in the respect pointed out, is not a cause for the reversal of the judgment.
Upon the issue as to whether or not the fraud might not have been discovered by Lee, the jury was instructed by the court: “If you believe that Lee exercised ordinary diligence and care, and did not discover the fraud, if any was committed by Pierce, prior to February 4, 1883, or if, by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence, Lee could not have learned of the fraud, if any was committed by Pierce, before the 4th of February, 1883, then the cause of action is not barred by limitation. What is meant by ordinary diligence and care, is such diligence and care as men of ordinary prudence exercise with reference to their own property.”
There is nothing prejudicial to the defendants in this instruction. It is rather more favorable to them than otherwise. It was proper also to instruct the jury to take into consideration all of the attendant circumstances which would tend to excuse Lee from any lack of diligence in the discovery of the fraud. His great age, the relationship of Pierce to him, both by family ties and as his trusted attorney and agent, and the condition of the parties, are all matters that should be considered by the jury in determining whether or not Lee exercised proper diligence.
Appellant’s thirty-second assignment of error is: “That the verdict is not supported by the evidence, and the judgment does not dispose of the questions involved in this case, there being no judgment divesting title out of Lee to the lands which Pierce exchanged to Lee.”
This assignment is too general to require us to review the evidence in order to determine whether or not it is sufficient to support the verdict. Defendants did not ask to have title to the land reinvested in the estate of Pierce; and although it might be proper to do so without such prayer for relief, it does not appear that any injury has been done to defendants by the failure so to do; but on the contrary, it does appear that Pierce sold the Hill County land to Tarlton, Jordan & Tarlton, and there is no evidence that he had title to the Harris County land, which he conveyed to Lee by a quitclaim deed.
In their thirty-third assignment of error appellants embrace the entire motion for a new trial, covering about eight pages of a type-written record, and including all of the points previously raised. This is not a distinct specification of the errors separately presented under proper assignment, copied into the brief and accompanied by appropriate propositions and statements as required by the rules, and we must decline to consider it.
Delivered October 14, 1892.
No error having been properly called to our attention, for which the judgment of the court below ought to be reversed, it is affirmed.

219120,H. W. Haley & Wife v. W. W. Manning,1893-01-02,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
Action by the appellee to recover of the appellant H. W. Haley, on a promissory note for $1000, and to foreclose a mortgage given by him on certain machinery and a tract of land to secure the payment of the debt. The defenses were, that the note was given in consideration of the machinery, which plaintiff fraudulently represented to be in a good condition, when in fact it was worn and was in a bad condition, and was almost wholly worthless; and that the consideration had failed; also that the land was the separate property of the wife as well as the homestead of Haley and his family. These last defenses were also set up by the wife in a plea of intervention. The appeal is from a judgment .in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of the note sued on, with foreclosure of the mortgage.
Appellants complain of the charge of the court, that the case was withdrawn from the jury. They contend, that the mortgage was executed to secure an antecedent debt, and was upon no valuable consideration, and that evidence was admissible to show that the land was purchased with the separate means of Mrs. Haley, and was her separate property, and that it was not bound by the mortgage; that without pleading on the part of plaintiff, evidence was not admissible to show that he took the mortgage without notice of Mrs. Haley’s separate right in the land. Exceptions were taken to the action of the court in excluding evidence to show that the machinery was worthless, and to prove the value of the improvements put on the land, in order to show notice of the wife’s claim; and in permitting the witness Moore to testify as to the statement made to him by the defendant Haley, that he bought the land for the purpose of executing a mortgage thereon to the plaintiff.
Briefly stated, the following are the facts in the case:
1. The execution of the note and mortgage was admitted by the defendants.
2. Defendant first agreed to purchase the machinery, upon which the foreclosure was had, from the plaintiff in the fall of 1885, and afterward executed the note sued on in consideration thereof, and secured the same by the execution of the mortgage on the machinery and the land.
3. When he first talked to plaintiff about buying the machinery, plaintiff told him that it was in good condition, and for defendant to take an expert and go and examine it, which defendant did. He secured the services of one Buford, who was considered an expert in such matters, and made the examination, and Buford told him that he was bit in his trade. Defendant returned to plaintiff and told him the condition in which he and Buford had found the machinery. Plaintiff replied, that it was good machinery; that he had had it examined by a machinist named Warren. Defendant then made the trade, and took possession of the machinery about November 1, 1885, with the understanding that he was to give his note therefor, secured by the mortgage. He had Buford to help him move it. They took it down from where it stood and moved it on to the land afterward mortgaged.
4. The evidence showed that the machinery was in a very bad condition, and that after a great deal of work thereon, defendant finally set it aside and bought new machinery. Defendant did not demand a cancellation of the trade on the ground of fraudulent representation, nor for any other reason. At one time, it was not stated when, he went to the plaintiff and asked him to take the machinery back and sell it and credit him with the proceeds, which plaintiff declined to do; and in the fall of 1889 he offered to return the machinery and pay plaintiff $100 to release him from the note.
5. The note and mortgage sued on were executed April 23, 1886, for the purchase money of the machinery, after the defendant had had it in use since November, 1885. There was not any evidence of fraud on the part of plaintiff in the sale of the machinery to the defendant.
6. It was shown by the evidence, that the separate means of Mrs. Haley were used by her husband to pay for the land which was mortgaged, and which is described in the petition. It was purchased from T. C. Moore, and the deed was executed to the husband, H. W. Haley. Plaintiff had no notice, either actual or constructive, of the equity of Mrs. Haley.
7. The land had not been designated as a homestead, nor used for any of the purposes thereof, when the mortgage was executed, and not until sometime thereafter was it used or occupied as a homestead.
1. The court did not err in its charge to the jury, by which the jury was instructed virtually to return a verdict for the plaintiff, because there was no evidence to sustain the defenses pleaded. The evidence failed to show any fradulent representations by the plaintiff as to the condition of the machinery, or any warranty with respect thereto.
2. It devolved upon the defendant to show that the plaintiff took the mortgage with notice of the equity of Mrs. Haley, and it was not necessary for the plaintiff to so plead; hence it was not error to permit plaintiff to testify, without pleading, that he had no notice of any such equity.
3. As there was no evidence as to any fraudulent representation by the plaintiff with respect to the machinery or its value, there could be no material error., in refusing to allow the witnesses to testify as to its worthless condition.
4. It clearly appeared from the evidence, that the note and mortgage were executed for the purchase of the machinery; consequently it was not error to hold that they were executed upon a valuable consideration, and not without consideration, as upon an antecedent debt; and that plaintiff having taken the security without notice of the equity of Mrs. Haley, it could not be asserted against him.
5. No injury could result from permitting the witness Moore to testify that Haley stated to him when he bought the land that it was for the purpose of mortgaging the same to the plaintiff, because the rights of Mrs. Haley were not in such an attitude as to be prejudiced thereby. Proof of valué of improvements was not admissible for any purpose.
The judgment of the court below is affirmed.
Affirmed.

216246,Joseph E. Briggs v. Milton Rush et al.,1892-10-14,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
This suit was brought by the appellant in the District Court of Anderson County on April 14, 1890, against W. J. Hamlett and wife, J. B. Watkins, and Milton Rush. The object of the suit was to recover judgment against defendants Hamlett and wife fur debt due by them on a promissory note, and judgment also for same debt against defendant Rush upon alleged assumption of same by Rush, and an assignment thereof to plaintiff by defendant W. J. Hamlett; and for the foreclosure of a mortgage upon two tracts of land, one containing 40 acres and the other 160 acres of land, executed by defendants Hamletts to cure the debt sued for, and which land had been purchased by defendant Watkins at a sale made under a junior mortgage executed for his benefit by said Hamlett and wife; and for the further purpose of enforcing the vendor’s lien upon said lands; and upon another tract of 200 acres, formerly occupied by Hamlett and wife, and which, together with the 160 acres and the 40 acres, mortgaged as aforesaid, were conveyed by Hamlett and wife to defendant Rush, for a valuable consideration, on January 5, 1887.
The defendants Hamlett and his wife answered by general denial and plea of coverture for the wife. The defendant Watkins answered the plaintiff’s petition by admitting the prior lien of the plaintiff, and avei> ring that the defendant Hamlett having made default in the payment oí his debt to defendant, he had caused the trustee in his mortgage, under power óf sale given therein, to sell the said 160 and 40 acres of land, and at said sale defendant became the purchaser; and further averring that by the terms of the sale made to defendant Rush by Hamlett and wife, Rush assumed the payment of Hamlett’s debt to plaintiff, and his debt to defendant also; and that the deed of conveyance from Hamlett to Rush reserved the vendor’s lien on all of the tracts of land sold to Rush, and that said lien had been transferred to plaintiff. He prayed that the court would require the plaintiff to first sell the tract of 200 acres, upon which there was no mortgage, before seliing the other two tracts purchased by defendant at the sale made as aforesaid under his mortgage; and he further prayed that if both the mortgaged land and the other tract sold to Rush should be sold under the decree of the court, and if the amount realized from the sales should be insufficient to satisfy both the plaintiff’s debt and his own, that he might have judgment against Rush for any balance due him; and for general relief.
Defendant Rush, on the 21st of November, 1890, filed, under affidavit, his amended original answer to plaintiff’s petition, in which he denies that he ever assumed to pay either Hamlett’s debt to plaintiff or Hamlett’s debt to defendant Watkins. He admits that he traded his homestead in Ellis County to Hamlett for 400 acres of land in Anderson County, and that at the time of the trade he knew that the two tracts of 40 and 160 acres each were subject to the mortgages of plaintiff and defendant Watkins, and that he traded for the land subject to the liens; but he denies that he agreed to become liable for either of said debts, and avers that he traded with the distinct understanding and agreement with the said Hamlett that he would not become responsible for either his debt to plaintiff or his debt to Watkins, and that the tract of 200 acres, which was the homestead of Hamlett and wife, must be free from all liens or other incumbrances, otherwise he would not exchange lands with him. That his own homestead was paid for and free from all liens, and that he must have one in the same condition. That upon the assurance of Hamlett that such was the case, the trade was agreed to, and Hamlett was to convey the homestead free of liens, and the other tracts of 160 and 40 acres each; he to redeem these lands or not, as he, defendant, might elect. And in addition Hamlett was to execute to him his eight negotiable notes for $350 each; and defendant and wife were to convey to Hamlett their homestead in Ellis County; that his wife and himself, on their part, did execute to Hamlett a deed to their homestead, and that Hamlett executed his eight notes to defendant, each for $350, and delivered to defendant a deed for the three tracts of land. That defendant, relying on the assurances of Hamlett, supposed and believed that the deed of conveyance was executed in accordance with the terms of the trade, and did not know that said deed reserved a lien upon the lands, and by its terms made him liable for the debts of Hamlett, until the deed was examined by his counsel, after the institution of plaintiff’s suit. Charges that the recitals reserving a lien and making defendant liable for debts due plaintiff and defendant Watkins were inserted through procurement of Hamlett, without the consent or the knowledge of defendant, and that Hamlett well knew that he, defendant, would never have conveyed his homestead had he known that a lien would be retained upon the lands' sold him, or that he was to be made liable for Hamlett’s debts; avers his ignorance of the law, and that he is unable to read manuscript, and that he relied upon Hamlett to have the deed properly drawn; charges him (Hamlett) with fraud, and prays that the deed from him to Hamlett may be reformed and made to conform to the terms of the trade; and for general relief.
On the 23d day of April, 1891, plaintiff filed, with leave of the court, his first supplemental petition, excepting to defendant Rush’s first amended original answer, and on same day defendant Rush filed his original answer to demands of defendant Watkins, in which he adopts his first amended original answer to plaintiff’s petition. Upon this state of the pleadings the case was on the same day, April 23, 1891, called for trial, when all parties announced ready, and a jury was impanneled; and when the pleadings had all been read the plaintiff moved to submit his exceptions to Rush’s answer to the court, and the court declined to consider the same, because the day for considering and determining questions of law, in cases in which juries were demanded, had passed; and plaintiff’s cause had been called on that day for the purpose of hearing exceptions, and none were presented for the consideration of the court; to which ruling the plaintiff excepted, and the trial proceeded; and after argument had begun, plaintiff discovering that some of his evidence was not before the court, as he supposed it to be when he announced ready, took a voluntary nonsuit, and thereupon the trial proceeded upon the answer of defendant Rush, charging fraud, and praying that his deed from Hamlett be reformed. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, and judgment was rendered, reforming the deed in accordance with the prayer of the complainant Rush, and dismissing the plaintiff’s suit as to the other defendants, without prejudice to plaintiff; and motion for new trial having been overruled, plaintiff gave notice of appeal.
The first error assigned is the refusal of the court to consider and determine the exceptions filed by leave of the court, on the day of the trial of the cause, to defendant Rush’s first amended original answer. In support of the first proposition under this assignment appellant cites Rev. Stats., arts. 1192 and 1269, and Teas v. McDonald, 13 Texas, 349.
With all deference to counsel, we do not think these authorities applicable to the question before us. Article 1289, Revised Statutes, makes it the duty of the court to dispose of all questions of law in causes in which trial by jury is demanded, as far as practicable, before the day set for the trial of such cases. The trial judge in this case, in an addendum to plaintiff’s bill of exceptions, states that Monday, the 20th of April, 1891, was the day set for hearing and deciding questions of law in the jury cases, and that on that day the docket was regularly called and all parties given an opportunity to present their exceptions, and that none were presented in this case by the plaintiff. The answer of defendant, to which exceptions were filed on the 23d of April, had been on file since the 20th of November, 1890. The plaintiff offered to the trial court no excuse for or explanation why his exceptions were not presented prior to the day set for the trial of jury cases. Under such circumstances we can not hold that the court erred in refusing to entertain the exceptions when presented. Article 1289 is obligatory upon the judges of the District Court. Its purpose is obvious, and unless a judge is clearly guilty of abuse of power in his efforts to enforce the observance of this statute by litigants, this court will not interfere.
The second error assigned is, that the court did not reinstate the cause upon plaintiff’s motion to set aside nonsuit. The basis of plaintiff’s suit against defendants Hamlett and Watkins was a note or bond of Hamlett, with attached coupons, and the grounds for his motion to reinstate are thus stated in the motion: “ Plaintiff resides in New York, and was not present at the trial of this cause. The bond and coupons, as well as the $99 notes sued on, were in the possession of the L. M. Watkins Land Company, and when suit was instituted it was believed by plaintiff’s attorneys, and so understood, that some of the coupons, to-wit, those due February, 1888, 1889, and 1890, and those due August, 1888, 1889, and 1890, not being paid, that the bond for $1000 became due, which is a fact, and so alleged, and gave plaintiff his right of action against defendants.
“ When plaintiff’s counsel announced ready for trial, they were of opinion that said coupons were attached to said bond; but after argument had commenced, it was found that the coupons past due at the time of filing of the petition were not in their possession, but were believed to be in the possession of Watkins, one of the defendants, and laboring under such mistake, plaintiff announced ready for trial.”
From this it will be seen that had counsel inspected the bond before announcing ready for trial, tjiey would have discovered the loss of the coupons; and the sole question presented for our determination is, did the trial judge abuse his discretion in refusing the motion to set aside the nonsuit ? While we admit that the court might properly have sustained the motion, as to defendants Hamlett and Watkins, we are not prepared to say that his refusal to do so would warrant us in reversing the ruling, when no injury is shown to result to plaintiff.
The third and fourth assignments we will not consider seriatum, as the objections urged under them to the action of the court in refusing plaintiff’s motion to grant him a new trial may be considered under three heads:
(1) That the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict; and (2) that the weight of the evidence is against the verdict; and (3) that the evidence discovered since the trial, as shown by the affidavit of McKinney, should have secured a new trial.
As to the first objection, we think the evidence was amply sufficient to sustain the verdict, if the jury gave credence to the testimony of the witnesses for the defendant. It was the province of the jury to determine the credibility of the witnesses, and if they gave credit to the defendant’s witnesses, rather than to plaintiff’s, the verdict should not be disturbed in the absence of any evidence tending to show that it was the result of prejudice or other improper influence.
The second proposition is, that the weight of the evidence was clearly with the plaintiff, and therefore the verdict, under the law, as given in the charge, should have been set aside. We consider the case to be one of a conflict of testimony, rather than a question of preponderance of evidence; and when this is the case, and the trial judge who hears the witnesses testify refuses to set aside the verdict, it is well settled that the appellate court will not do so.
We deduce from the record these conclusions of fact, viz.: That the defendant Rush and W. J. Hamlett agreed to an exchange of lands; that Rush conveyed his homestead to Hamlett in consideration of the conveyance to him by Hamlett and wife of their homestead containing 200 acres, and the two tracts of 160 and 40 acres each, and the execution of eight negotiable promissory notes for $350 each by Hamlett to Rush, and that the 160 and 40 acres tracts were received by Rush with the full knowledge of the mortgages of plaintiff and defendant Watkins, and that Rush paid some $140 on these mortgage debts after he took possession of the lands; and that after a few months he concluded the lands were worth less than the debts for which they were liable, and he then determined not to redeem them, and so notified both Hamlett and his creditors.
Delivered October 14, 1892.
We further conclude, that Bush made large and valuable improvements upon the 200 acres, the former homestead of Hamlett, and that Bush was not present when the deed of conveyance from Hamlett to Bush was prepared by McKinney, under instruction from Hamlett, and that there is no evidence that the deed was read to Bush, or that he read it for himself, before delivering his deeds to Hamlett.
When these facts are considered in connection with the testimony of all the witnesses, we are not prepared to say that the preponderance of the evidence is against the verdict.
The appellant’s first proposition under the fourth assignment is not questioned, but the law as contained in this proposition is not applicable to the facts. The “newly discovered evidence” is the affidavit of McKinney, the notary who prepared the deeds from Hamlett and wife to Bush, and from Bush and wife to Hamlett, and took their acknowledgments. The testimony of this witness is: “I have no recollection of reading the deed to Mr. Bush, as the law does not require a notary to read a deed to a man before he acknowledges it. Yet I am satisfied that Mr. Bush did fully understand that the vendor’s lien was retained in the deed on all the 400 acres of land, to secure the payment of the two notes named in the deed; he may have forgotten.” This affidavit is clearly not such as the law requires to support an application for a new trial, on ground of newly discovered evidence. Besides, the answer of Bush setting up fraud was filed on the 20th day of November, 1890, and the deeds of conveyance showed that McKinney took the acknowledgments, and no reason is shown why the deposition of this witness, if material, was not taken before the trial.
We discover no error for which the judgment should be reversed, and we therefore affirm it.
Affirmed.
Justice Williams did not sit in this case."
219212,Henry F. Grimes v. James M. Shaw,1893-01-12,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
In 1883, upon an inquisition of lunacy, duly instituted therein, the County Court of Grimes County adjudged William Berryman to be a lunatic, and by an order duly entered upon its minutes appointed one W. H. Gussett guardian of the person and estate of the lunatic. From this judgment Berryman appealed to the District Court, and executed a bond in accordance with the provisions of the statute, and thereby suspended the operation of the judgment, and prevented the said Gussett from qualifying as guardian.
In June, 1887, appellant purchased from Berryman a tract of 250 acres of land situated in Grimes County. By the terms of the sale, the appellant agreed and promised to improve the land and reside upon it, and the vendor, the said Berryman, was to reside with him, and was to be maintained and comfortably supported by Grimes for the remainder of his life. Grimes took possession of the land, made improvements thereon, and Berryman became an inmate of his family.
In April, 1888, the District Court of Grimes County, upon trial of the case appealed from the County Court, adjudged Berryman to be insane, and appointed appellee guardian of his person and estate; and as such guardian, appellee, on the 14th day of March, 1889, instituted this suit for the recovery of the land purchased as aforesaid by Grimes, and for cancellation of the deed of conveyance, and for rents. Appellee also caused a writ of sequestration to be levied upon the land, and the appellant replevied it.
To the appellee’s suit appellant pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court, pleaded also the general denial, and pleaded specially the sanity of his vendor, Berryman, averring that he never had been insane, and that he had capacity to contract at the time of the sale of the land to him; he pleaded also tenancy in good faith and the erection of valuable improvements upon the land, and that he had maintained and supported Berry-man until he was induced by the persuasion of the appellee to abandon the home of the appellant; and he charged that the writ of sequestration was maliciously sued out and levied upon the land in controversy by appellee, for the purpose of injuring and harassing him; and he pleaded in reconvention damages, resulting to him from the malice of appellee in levying the writ of sequestration upon his lands, and in alienating Berryman from him and destroying the friendly relations existing between them; and concluded with alternative prayer, that if the court should adjudge the sale of the land to appellant by Berryman to be invalid, that he might be allowed the value of his improvements, and that he be reimbursed out of the estate of Berryman for the expenses incurred in supporting him and in supplying him with proper medical treatment while an inmate of his family.
The defendant’s pleas and answers, original, amended, and supplemental, and the exceptions to them, are so numerous, that we find it difficult to determine with certainty what were the issues which were finally presented and determined by the court; but as we read the transcript, exceptions were sustained to the defendant’s plea to the jurisdiction, and to all of his answer except the general denial; and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff for the land and for the value of its use and occupation. One of the pleas to the jurisdiction was based upon the assumption that the judgment of the District Court declaring Berryman a lunatic, and appointing appellee his guardian, was void, as the judgment showed upon its face that it was rendered by consent of plaintiff and counsel representing Berryman, and without evidence; but the record does not sustain this assumption, and the judgment is not void, and we therefore conclude that the court did not err in sustaining exceptions to this plea. While from the statement of facts in evidence upon trial of this cause, it might be inferred that there was no trial had in the District Court, and that the court rendered judgment upon consent of parties, yet we can scarcely believe that the learned judge who pronounced that judgment would have adjudged a citizen insane, and placed him and his estate in the custody of another, except upon ample proof and after mature deliberation. Nor did the court err in sustaining exceptions to appellant’s plea to its jurisdiction, based upon the assumption that the court was not being held at the county seat.
The controlling question presented by the assignments of error for our decision is, Did the court err in holding that the judgment of lunacy was conclusive against the appellant, and in refusing to permit him to show, if he could, that Berryman was sane and capable of contracting at the time of the purchase of the land in question ?
There is, perhaps, no subject upon which mankind are more disposed to differ than that of the condition of the human mind; and a rule of law which would make a judgment of lunacy conclusive against the world would be fraught with danger and injustice to third parties. Our Supreme Court, in accord with the great weight of authority, has said, that a contract made with one who has been adjudged insane, and is under the control and custody of a guardian, duly appointed, is void. Elston v. Jasper, 45 Texas, 409. But in this case, the judgment of lunacy pronounced by the County Court was suspended by the appeal and the supersedeas bond, at the time of the purchase of the land by appellant, and at that time Berryman was without a guardian of either his person or his estate. And when such is the case, it seems a judgment in lunacy is only prima facie evidence against third persons. Black on Judg., 803, par. 802; 51 N. Y., 359; 18 Am. Dec., 417; 1 Greenl., sec. 550. This rule commends itself to our judgment, and especially when, as in this •case, the judgment in lunacy is retroactive.
For this error of the trial court the case must be reversed, and the appellant permitted to show, if he can, that Berryman was not a lunatic, and had mental capacity to make sale of the lands. The burden of proof will be on appellant, and the judgment of lunacy will be prima facie evidence of the insanity of Berryman at the time of the sale. If, upon this issue, the decision be for appellee, the appellant, if by proper averments and proof he shows himself to be a tenant in good faith, may recover for valuable and permanent improvements made by him upon the land, the measure of his compensation being the enhanced value of the realty by reason of such improvements; and the appellee will be entitled to recover the rental value of the premises, denuded of the improvements. The appellant will be also entitled to recover for actual necessaries furnished Berryman, if the latter should be found to have been insane at the time of the sale.
If the result Qf the trial be that Berryman was sane and capable to contract at the time of the sale to appellant, upon proof that the writ of sequestration was maliciously sued out and levied upon the land by appellee, with the intention and purpose to harass and injure appellant, the-latter should recover under his plea in reconvention such damages as the evidence may show were the proximate result of the levy of the writ; and exemplary damages also, if averred and claimed by the plea. We take occasion to say, that before another trial the parties should be required to replead.
The judgment of the lower court is reversed and the cause remanded for retrial.

219089,"S. W. Fordyce and A. H. Swanson, Receivers, v. Thomas Chancey",1893-01-12,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
This is a suit by appellee, against appellants, as receivers of the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway in Texas, to recover damages for injuries received by him while traveling as a passenger over a railway controlled by appellants.
Appellants pleaded, that pending this suit they had been discharged from the receivership by the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Texas, which appointed them, and had relinquished control of the property committed to their charge as such receivers, to the purchasers thereof.
On the trial it was agreed, that the property had been by the appellants turned over to the purchasers under the foreclosure proceedings, and that the appellants, since such transfer, had ceased to have any control or management of the same.
The order of the United States Circuit Court, requiring appellants to turn over the property, provided that all claims against the receivership should be established by intervention in that court, and that the bills in the cause would be retained for the purpose of investigating such liabilities, in order to have a final settlement of such receivership.
No order was shown expressly discharging the receivers, and there was no agreement that such order existed, and it in no way appeared that the .accounts of the receivers had ever been acted on, and a decree entered by the court discharging them. This case, therefore, differs materially from that of the same appellants against C. H. Beecher, just decided. That ■decision was based solely upon the legal effect of the decree of the Federal Court discharging the receivers, which was admitted to exist. Here the receivers, for all the record shows, may still hold their office and be in a position to defend the suit and meet the judgment rendered.
It is true it appears that they had turned over the property put in their charge to purchasers, but they are not, so far as the record shows, removed from their offices, and the Circuit Court expressly retains the bills for the purpose of adjusting their liabilities. We do not think this state of the record presents the same question as was considered in the Beecher casé, and hold therefore that appellants’ eleventh assignment of error is not well taken.
The nineteenth assignment of error presents the question, whether or not the court could properly declare a lien on the property which had been in the possession of the receivers, to secure a liability incurred by them. We do not find it necessary, at this time, to decide this question, and will not do so until it has been more thoroughly argued and considered.
The points raised in the seventeenth assignment of error, and propositions thereunder, were considered in the case of these appellants against Withers (1 Texas Civil Appeals, 540), and determined against appellants.
Appellants’ first assignment of error complains of the admission of evidence to show that after the accident in which appellee was hurt appellants had made changes and repairs in its track. This kind of evidence is usually not admissible. Railway v. McGowan, 73 Texas, 355; Railway v. Hennessey, 75 Texas, 155; Railway v. Jones, 14 S. W. Rep., 309.
In the Withers case, above referred to, this court held, that evidence there offered by plaintiff was admissible to rebut testimony of witnesses for defendants, to the effect that the road where this wreck occurred was in safe condition before and after the wreck, and had remained in the same condition both before and after the wreck. That evidence was also held admissible as tending to show the actual condition of the track when the wreck occurred. On the trial of this case plaintiff offered the objectionable evidence in chief, and not in rebuttal of the testimony of defendants’ witnesses. It can not be held to serve any legitimate purpose in establishing the condition of the road at the time of the accident, for after the witnesses had stated all facts properly admissible for that purpose, they were allowed to go further and state in detail what had been done towards improving the track. Under the rulings of our Supreme Court, this was improper, and unless the evidence should become relevant for the purpose of rebutting testimony offered by appellants, it should be excluded on another trial.
The fourth assignment of error complains of the following portion of the court’s charge: “You are charged, that receivers of railway companies, as other common carriers, in the operation and management of the railway under their control, are held under the law to the greatest possible care and diligence for the safety of the passengers they undertake to carry; and while they are not insurers of absolute safety of their passengers, yet they are required to provide for their safe conveyance, as far as human care and foresight will go.” This instruction was held erroneous in the Withers case, supra.
There was error in the passage of the charge on the measure of damages, wherein the jury were instructed to allow for value of time lost, there being no evidence of such value. Some of the language of appellants’ counsel was improper, and should not occur again. The court, however, rebuked the counsel, and gave the jury proper instructions on the subject.
We have carefully considered all of the other assignments, and find no other material errors. The court’s definition of negligence, as copied in the second assignment, is somewhat objectionable, perhaps, but full and correct instructions were given in other parts of the charge, and in special charges given at the request of appellants.
The special charges found in the seventh and eighth assignments state the law correctly, but the rules which they announce were sufficiently given, and it would have been improper for the court to repeat in so many forms the same propositions.
The charge complained of- in the fifth assignment of error is correct and is applicable .to the case. The evidence left uncertain the exact cause of the wreck. It may have resulted from one defect or from the combined effect of several defects and careless running of the train. The-fact that a wreck occurred is evidence for the jury to consider, and in the absence of proof showing that it was the consequence of some particular cause, it was proper for the court to give to the jury the rules by which appellants’ whole duty to their passengers was measured, in order that they might determine whether or not there had been a neglect to perform it in any particular. For this reason appellants’ fifth special charge was-correctly refused, and their tenth qualified by the court.
The charge of the court on the measure of damages, with the exception of the part above held to be erroneous, was correct. It is not properly open to the objection made in the fourteenth assignment. In regard to future damages it was not very full, and it would have been proper to give a special charge correctly stating the rules applicable, if asked. But-the special charge requested (number 5) required that the jury be “ satisfied ’’ that the apprehended results would flow from the injuries. This exacted too high a degree of proof for a civil case, and the charge was-properly refused.
The errors we have pointed out are all we have found of which appellants can complain.
The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.

216307,Martin Hinzie v. W. L. Moody & Co.,1892-10-14,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
W. L. Moody & Co. brought suit in the District Court of Anderson County, October 30, 1889, against Martin Hinzie, by attachment for debt. The petition alleged, that on the 15th day of February 1889, the defendant executed and delivered to plaintiffs his two promissory notes in writing, in the first of which he promised on October 15, 1889, to pay to the order of plaintiffs the.sum of $2500, with 12 per cent interest from maturity, and 10 per cent in addition as attorney fees in the event the note was not paid at maturity and should be placed with an attorney for collection; that in the second note he promised to pay to the order of plaintiff on November 15, 1889, the sum of $2500, with 12 per cent interest per annum from maturity, and .10 per cent in addition as attorney fees in the event the note should not be paid at maturity and should be placed in the hands of an attorney for collection; and that by reason of the premises the defendant became bound to pay plaintiffs the said first note, principal, interest, and attorney fees, and, when due, the principal of said second note. The petition showed also that plaintiffs had filed therewith their affidavit and bond for attachment.
Plaintiffs’ affidavit as to indebtedness-is: “ That Martin Hinzie, defendant in, attachment, is justly indebted to the said W. L. Moody & Co. in the following amounts, to-wit, in the sum of $2500, with interest thereon at the rate of 12 per cent per annum from October 15, 1889; that above indebtedness is due on promissory note, payable on said October 15, 1889, which said note further stipulates that if it (the note) is not paid at maturity and it (the note) is placed with an attorney for collection, that said Martin Hinzie agrees to pay 10 per cent in addition to the said above; and affiant says that said defendant Hinzie is justly indebted to said W. L. Moody & Co. in the further amount of this 10 per cent. That said Martin Hinzie is justly indebted to said W. L. Moody & Co. in the further sum of $2500 on promissory note, not yet due.”
The writ of attachment is in due form, and directs the sheriff to attach forthwith so much of the property of Martin Hinzie, if to be found, repleviable on security, as shall be of value sufficient to make the sum of $5263.75, etc. It was levied upon twenty-seven parcels of land situated in Anderson County, and due return thereof, made, with full description of the land.
On November 27, 1889, plaintiffs filed their amended original petition, and declared on both of the notes mentioned in the original petition, and asked for foreclosure of their attachment lien.
Defendant moved to quash the attachment, because:
1. A note for $2500 and $250 attorney fees is sued on, while the attachment is for $5263.75.
2. Affidavit alleges $2500 and $250 attorney fees, due October 15, 1889, and also $2500 not due, but fails to allege when the last named debt will become due.
3. Writ is sued out for $5263.75, which was grossly excessive, following the pleadings.
4. There is no affidavit showing when the last named note would become due.
A fifth ground for quashing the attachment, so far as not included in the above, is not relied on here.
The motion to quash was overruled, and the defendant excepted. Defendant’s answer, filed November 22, 1889, presents no defense that is relied on in this court; but, by leave of the court, Herbert, Agnes Mary, William Eugene, Francis Thomas, Rose Helena, Raymond Carroll, and Joseph Leonard Hinzie, minor children of the defendant and his deceased wife, intervened by their said father, the defendant, as natural guardian and next friend, and made themselves parties to the suit. The defendant also joined in the petition of the interveners in his own right. They setup:
1. Homestead right in and to lot 10, block 163, and lot 20, block 162, of the property levied on as the defendant’s place of business.
2. That Herbert Hinzie is the owner in fee simple of lot 1 in block G-.
3. That of all the other lands levied on, the interveners, as the heirs of their mother, own her community interest therein; that there had been no administration on the estate of the mother, nor any necessity for the same.
They prayed judgment that said interests be declared not subject to attachment.
Plaintiffs moved to strike out the intervention, because it was not shown “ that said intervenors have any such right in the subject matter of the suit between plaintiff and defendant as entitles them to intervene herein, and because it appears that they have a full and complete remedy at law, and the judgment in this case will not affect their rights.”
This motion was sustained by the court, except in so far as the same set up the homestead exemption.
Trial was had, and there was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs for the amount of both notes, with interest and attorney fees, with a foreclosure of the attachment lien, except as to lot No. 10 in block 163, and a portion of another lot used in connection with the place of residence.
Appellant’s motion to quash the attachment in this case was properly overruled. It is not necessary that the affidavit should state when the amount that is shown not to be due will become due; a separate statement of them is sufficient. Willis v. Mooring, 63 Texas, 340; Munzenheimer & Klein v. Cloak and Suit Co., 79 Texas, 319.
The affidavit states plainly what the indebtedness consists of and what portion of it is not due; and it states the facts from which the entire amount can be ascertained. It is also fully sustained by the petition. Ascertaining the entire amount of the indebtedness from the items stated in the affidavit, it appears to be $5263.75, which is the amount stated in the writ. The second note had not become due, and consequently no attorney fees were collectible on it, and it did not bear interest until after maturity, so that as to the second note attachment could run only for the principal thereof.
There was no exception taken to the action of the court in dismissing the plea of intervention in so far as it set up title in the minor children of Hinzie and his deceased wife to one-lialf of the property levied on as the community property of their mother, and in Herbert Hinzie the entire interest in one of the lots; and there is no appeal from the judgment of the court in any respect by said minor heirs. The appeal bond is executed by Hinzie alone, and it is made payable to W. L. Moody & Co. alone, so the heirs are not parties to the appeal. Hinzie has appealed in his own right alone. But we do not see any error in the action of the court. The heirs were not interested in the subject matter of the suit, and they did not show any equitable grounds for such intervention. Whitman v. Willis, 51 Texas, 424; Hinzie v. Kempner, 82 Texas, 620.
Whether or not the warehouse in controversy was a part of the business homestead of the defendant, presents a question of some difficulty. We do not deem it necessary to examine appellant’s several assignments of error, raising this question, separately, because they all lead to the one question as to the exemption of the warehouse. Appellant contends that it is a mixed question of law and of fact which should have been submitted to the jury, and that it was error for the court in its charge to instruct the jury that the warehouse was not exempt. If the facts showed that the warehouse was not exempt as a part of the defendant’s business homestead, then it would be proper for the court to so charge the jury.
We find the facts with reference to the use of the warehouse to be as follows:
On the 27th day of October, 1889, M. Hinzie was a merchant in the city of Palestine, and as such was a wholesale and retail dealer in groceries, hardware, and tinware, and his storehouse, which he kept open, and in which he exposed his goods for sale, and in which he kept his office and books, was situated on lot No. 10 in block No. 163 of said city. Across the street, and in another block, and on lot No. 20, in block No. 162, he had his warehouse, in which he kept his goods in unbroken packages, and stoves and heavy goods; also kept there tinners’ tools, etc., and heavy and bulky goods. This warehouse was kept closed, generally, and the key to it kept in the other building. Goods were not exposed for sale in it, but he sometimes sold goods from it. When a customer came into the other building and wanted goods not in it, but in the warehouse, he would then take the key to the warehouse, go over there and sell the needed article or articles, and then lock it and return the key to the other building. The goods were kept in bulk in the warehouse; no shelves, nor counters, nor office. Hinzie called this house his warehouse. In it was a room in which Mr. Lowenstein, who was a practical tinner in Hinzie’s employ, kept his tin and sheet-iron tools, and Lowenstein also slept in this building. Upon this lot Hinzie also had a privy and water closet, which was used by himself and employes. Lot 10 in block 162 was covered with a two-story brick building, and fronted on the main business street in the city, and the warehouse was a frame building and was purchased by him several years after he had begun business in the other building. On October 27, Hinzie made a deed of trust upon all of his goods situated in both of these buildings, and gave to the trustee exclusive possession of the goods and the house in which they were situated, except that Hinzie retained the possession of his office in the brick building.
The evidence is undisputed that the business was transacted in the brick building on lot No. 10, and that the building on lot No. 20 was used only as a warehouse, except that the tinner slept in it and the water closet was on the premises. A warehouse on the same lot with the regular business house and attached to it as an enlargement thereof, has been held to be exempt. Hargadene v. Whitfield, 71 Texas, 489. But in McDonald v. Campbell, 57 Texas, 614, a warehouse situated on a different lot from that in which the business was conducted, and not adjacent thereto, was held not to be exempt. The evidence shows that the use of the warehouse in connection with the defendant’s business was bona fide and valuable; and if the question was such an one as should have been submitted to the jury, there could have been no doubt but that the jury would have returned a verdict that the warehouse was a part of the defendant’s business homestead. We do not think, however, that such a business home is within the contemplation of the Constitution. The lots must be used for the purpose of a home, or as a place in which to exercise the calling or business of the family. Outlets may be used' for such purposes in connection with a home as would make them a part of the homestead; but the business home must be the place ■where the head of the family exercises his calling or business. It is his workshop, office, or other place where he habitually is in the following of his calling, and not every other lot or building which he may incidentally use in connection therewith. Once begin to exempt warehouses and storerooms as a part of the business homestead, and there would be no limit except the value at the time of their designation as prescribed in the Constitution.
Delivered October 14, 1892.
We think that the design of the Constitution was to protect the workshop and business office, but in the practical application of the law large storerooms for goods exposed for sale have been necessarily included when they constitute the place of business.
The business homestead should be confined to the place where the calling or business is exercised, and is not to be extended to outlots which may be used for the purposes of the home, as in the case of the residence.
We think the facts conclusively show that the warehouse was not exempt, and that the court did not err in so instructing the jury. The judgment of the court below is affirmed.
Affirmed.
Justice Williams did not sit in this case."
219199,"S. W. Fordyce and A. H. Swanson, Receivers, v. C. H. Beecher",1893-01-12,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Prior to July, 1889, appellants were, appointed by the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Texas, receivers of the properties belonging to the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company in Texas, and were operating its roads.
In August, 1889, appellee, claiming to be a passenger on one of the-trains thus controlled by appellants, was assaulted and injured by their servants employed to manage it. He brought this suit to recover damages resulting from such injuries.
On the 11th day of May, 1891, while this suit was still pending, appellants were finally discharged from the receivership by the court which appointed them, and thereafter duly pleaded in this suit such discharge in bar of further proceedings against them. In the trial below the fact of the final discharge was admitted, and appropriate charges were presented to the court, declaring the law to be that such discharge constituted a complete bar to any judgment against appellants as receivers. The charges were refused, and verdict and judgment were rendered against appellants as receivers, and in this appeal this action of the court below is assigned as error.
The Act of the Legislature of March 19, 1889, concerning receivers, was not in force when appellants were appointed, but had taken effect when the cause of action accrued to appellee, and was in full operation when this suit was brought and when appellants were discharged. It provides, that the discharge of a receiver shall not have the effect of abating any pending suit upon a cause of action which accrued against him as such receiver, but that such suit may be prosecuted to judgment, notwithstanding the discharge.
One of the questions which arises as to the operation of those provisions upon this case is, do they apply to and control a discharge by a Federal court of a receiver appointed by it; and involved in this is the inquiry as to the power of a State Legislature to thus limit the effect of a decree of such a court.
The receivers were appointed in the exercise of the chancery jurisdiction which belongs to all of the Circuit Courts of the United States. That jurisdiction was conferred upon such courts when they were first organized, and in cases in which it is properly called into exercise, it is determinable solely by the National legislation. Neither the substantive powers thus conferred, nor the rules of practice and procedure through which they are exercised, are subject to limitation or modification by the States. This equity jurisdiction, practice, and procedure of the courts is uniform throughout the Union, is the same in all of the States, and is beyond the control of State Legislatures.
These principles have long been settled by the adjudications of the Supreme Court of the United States. Green v. Creighton, 23 How., 105; Hyde v. Stone, 20 How., 175; Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall., 425; United States v. Howland, 4 Cond. Rep., 406.
A judgment or decree is the end for which the jurisdiction of a court is exercised. It is only through its judgments and their execution that the power of a court is made efficacious. A law which restricts their power to render a judgment is therefore a limitation upon the exercise of their jurisdiction; and a law which destroys or impairs the effect which their judgments without such law would have, is equally so.
It is to be presumed that the Federal court properly acquired jurisdiction of the cause in which these receivers were appointed. That jurisdiction embraced power to dispose fully of all interests properly involved in the litigation, and to render all such judgments and decrees as were made appropriate to that end, by the principles of equity jurisprudence ■as they existed when such courts were organized, with such modifications as have been made from time to time by Congress, and the rules of those courts adopted in accordance therewith. That power could be controlled by Congress alone. By the principles governing the effect of judgments of courts of equity discharging their receivers, in the absence of the statute under consideration, such a judgment was made a bar to any further ■suit against such receiver for liability incurred solely by virtue of his office, and constituted, when pleaded in pending suits, a complete defense. Ryan v. Hays, 62 Texas, 47; Brown v. Gay, 76 Texas, 444.
If, therefore, the discharge of appellants, when pleaded in this suit, was not a bar to further proceedings, it was because the act of the Legislature took from it the effect given to it by the law that created and governed the court that pronounced the decree.
It is true, the statute does not in terms attempt to legislate directly upon the effect of the judgments of the courts of the United States, and we will advert to that presently. But if its operation should be what is claimed for it, the result would be much the same as if it had declared directly that no court of the Union should discharge a receiver while suits were pending in the State courts against him; or that a decree discharging such receiver pending such suits should not bar or abate the actions against him. A State Legislature can not so prescribe, because the National courts are not subject to State authority.
It may be said that the statute only prescribes a rule for the guidance of State courts in suits pending before them against receivers, in the conduct of further proceedings after the discharge. But a State court must recognize a defenáe of a party litigant before it, whether it arise through the operation of a decree of another court or not; and the scope of the decree must be determined by the law under which it was pronounced.
It may also be said, that inasmuch as the receiver, when appointed, is in a certain sense the representative of the owner of the property committed to his charge, it is competent for the Legislature to provide that he shall continue, after his discharge, to be such representative in suits brought before his discharge. The answer is, that receivers appointed by Federal courts, when they act within the proper limits of their jurisdiction, derive their authority from National laws, under which the court proceeds. It is only through the operation of such appointment, if at all, that the receiver is placed in the attitude of a representative. How long his authority as such may continue is a question committed to the judgment of the court whose authority he represents; and the operation of its order determining his relation to the property is derived and must be ascertained from the law under which that court has proceeded. The judgment of the Federal court must be recognized as having such effect, notwithstanding State statutes, not because of any paramount authority in those courts, but because they are independent of the control of the State, as are the courts of the State, except in respect of a few subjects, independent of National legislation. Riggs v. Johnson County, 6 Wall., 195.
If this statute should be held to apply to the discharge by United States courts of receivers appointed by them, it seems plain to us, that the effect would be to impair the operation given to such discharge by the rules of equity jurisprudence governing such courts. A State can not do this, •either directly or indirectly. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat., 1.
State laws are made the rule of decision for Federal courts, but can not control or affect their jurisdiction or procedure unless adopted by Congress or rule of court. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat., 1; Beers v. Houghton, 9 Pet., 359; Bayle v. Lachani, 6 Pet., 658; Bein v. Heath, 12 How., 168.
It must therefore be held, that the provision of the statute which we have cited does not apply to the judgments of courts of the United States discharging receivers appointed by them. Indeed, it is by no means clear that such application was intended. The. Act of 1889 is an amendment to the Act of 1887 on the same subject, two sections of the last named act being substituted by the former. The Act of 1887 thus amended is entitled, “An act to provide for the appointment of receivers, and to define their powers and duties, and to regulate proceedings under such appointment of receivers.” Its first section begins: “That a receiver may be appointed by any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction in this State, in the following cases.” Many provisions follow, nearly all of which plainly apply only to proceedings in our own courts. In a few of the provisions, as in that we have considered, the language is broad enough to embrace all receivers, wherever appointed; but no mention is made of any others than those whose appointment is provided for by our own courts. It ought not to be presumed that it was intended by any general terms used to regulate that over which the Legislature had no authority. Bank of the United States v. Halstead, 10 Wheat., 51.
The court below should therefore have given the charge requested by appellants, which instructed the jury to find in their favor. We intimate no opinion, however, as to the operation of the provisions of the statute creating a lien on property of the railway company, and authorizing other parties to be brought into the litigation, as they present questions differing from that which we have discussed. It will not therefore be determined whether or not, with proper parties before the court, a judgment, such as that rendered in this case, establishing a lien on the property, would be proper. The cases referred to by appellants are not like the present. In them it was held erroneous to declare and foreclose a, lien on property which was in the custody of the receiver of another court, pending the receivership. Here the receivers had been discharged and the court had relinquished its control over the property.
Hew parties may be made in the court below, or a different state of facts may be developed, which will require another trial on the merits, and we therefore will proceed to examine the other points raised in the appeal.
The court committed an error when it instructed the jury to allow damages for value of time lost by appellee, and expenses incurred by him for treatment of his injuries. There was some evidence tending, quite indefinitely, to show that some loss of time resulted to appellee from his-wounds, and it was shown that he was treated by physicians, but there was no evidence of the value of either.
There was no error in the charge complained of in the fifth assignment. It was applicable to the evidence and expressed the law correctly.
The refusal of special charges numbers 2,3, and 4 was not error. The evidence upon which these charges were predicated tended to show, that appellant, at Pollock, got on the platform of the baggage car, next to the tender, and rode there, without the knowledge of the conductor, until the train reached Baker’s Mill; that there he was discovered by the conductor, and then went into the smoking car. This was done openly and without concealment, and he was sitting quietly in the car, when he was approached by the conductor and assaulted, without any demand having been made for his fare, or any opportunity having been afforded him after he entered the car to pay it. After the conductor had struck him several blows, he demanded the fare, and appellee either paid or was in the act of paying it, when the assault was continued, and he was beaten, cut with a knife, and thrown from the train while it was in full motion. This is the state of facts shown by the record, and the rules of law relied on by appellants, and expressed in the special charges, have no application. It is not the case of a passenger who refuses to pay his fare when demanded, until the conductor has commenced his expulsion from the car, and who is then put off lawfully and with the exertion of no unnecessary force. In that kind of case, the authorities referred to hold that the passenger can not, after the expulsion has commenced, tender his fare and require the carrier’s servants to accept it and permit-him to remain on the cars. And he can not, at least at a place other than a station for receiving passengers, re-enter the same train, after he has been rightfully expelled, and become a passenger thereon. O’Brien v. Railway, 15 Gray, 20; Pease v. Railway, 26 Am. and Eng. Ry. Cases, 185.
Appellee went in the car at Baker’s Mill, a regular passenger station, it is to be inferred from the evidence, and was assaulted before his fare had been demanded. , It is not shown that his fare for riding on the platform of the car had been demanded and refused, and, for all the record discloses, he may have been ready to pay his fare from Pollock to his destination. We can not hold that the mere fact that he rode from Pollock to Baker’s Mill on'the platform of the car, to escape paying his fare, if such be the case, would deprive him of the right to become a passenger at a regular station, when no demand had been made for his fare, and no disturbance or breach of the peace had been committed by him. In all of these respects the case differs from those cited. Besides, the uncontradicted evidence shows, that the conductor began his expulson with an assault; followed that with a demand for his fare from appellee, and upon that being paid or offered, continued the use of violence, striking and cutting appellee, and finally threw him from the cars and left him dangerously wounded and senseless. In this he was exercising his functions as conductor, and acted as the servant of appellants; and whether the relation of carrier and passenger existed or not, the master would be liable. Cool, on Torts, 536.
The charges asked were therefore not applicable to the facts, and would have tended to confuse the jury.
The portion of the charge complained of in the fifteenth assignment, whether correct or not, presents a hypothesis in appellants’ favor which we think the evidence did not raise. No view of the case more favorable to them could arise out of this evidence, and they can not complain of the charge.
Because of errors indicated, the judgment is re /ersed and the cau°e remanded. ^
Reversed and remanded.

216215,Robert J. Horton et al. v. C. J. Garrison et al.,1892-10-18,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellants sued appellees in two actions of trespass to try title, to recover two tracts of land in Rusk County, of which A. C. Horton was the original grantee. Appellees pleaded not guilty, limitation under the three, five, and ten years statutes, improvements, and a special plea which need not be here stated, as it is not involved in their appeal. The causes were consolidated and tried together, by jury, and verdict and judgment rendered for appellees. Appellants asked for a new trial on the grounds hereinafter discussed, upon the overruling of which they appealed.
Appellants showed themselves to be the heirs of A. C. Horton. Appellees claimed under a sale of the land made under an execution against A. C. Horton’s executors. Upon the trial they offered what purported to be a copy of Horton’s will, from the probate records of Wharton County. Appellants objected to its admission, because it was not accompanied by the order of any court admitting the will to probate. Attached to the copy of the document was the affidavit or testimony of one of the subscribing witnesses, purporting to have been taken before the Probate Court of Wharton County, August 26, 1866, proving the proper 'execution of the will; but no order of the court was shown. Appellants objected to the evidence on this ground, and the objection was overruled and they reserved exception.
Appellees offered also a duly certified copy of a judgment of the District Court of Wharton County rendered December 9, 1871, in a cause styled T. J. Davis v. Eliza Horton executrix, and I. N. Dennis executor, of A. C. Horton, deceased, and numbered 754, which adjudged that the plaintiff recover of the estate of A. C. Horton, the testator of defendants, the sum of $2030, with interest and costs; and that execution issue to be levied upon the “ effects” of said estate.
They then read in evidence, over objection of appellants, an execution issued to Rusk County, January 4, 1875, which recited a judgment in favor of T. J. Davis against Eliza Horton, executrix, and I. N. Dennis, executor, of A. C. Horton, and commanded the sheriff, “that of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of the said Eliza Horton, executrix, and I. N. Dennis, executor, of A. C. Horton, deceased,” he make the moneys adjudged. In all other respects the execution correctly described and followed the judgment, which had been put in evidence. Endorsed upon the execution was the return of the sheriff, showing a levy upon and sale of the lands in controversy as the property of “the defendants,” which was also read in evidence.
Appellants objected to the execution and levy upon the grounds that the judgment did not warrant the execution, in that the judgment ordered a levy upon the ‘ ‘ effects ’ ’ (personal property) of the estate of Horton, while the execution directs a levy upon lands, etc., of Eliza Horton, executrix, and I. N. Dennis, executor, of A. C. Horton, deceased. These exceptions were overruled by the court, and a bill of exceptions was duly taken.
Appellees also read a deed from the sheriff to W. J. Phillips for the lands sold, as above stated, which deed was in accordance with the sale. Appellants objected to this on the same grounds as were the objections taken to the execution. Objections were overruled and exceptions reserved.
Appellees also read in evidence the petition of T. J. Davis against Eliza Horton and Dennis, as independent executrix and executor of A. C. Horton, based on a note given by the latter in his lifetime, the judgment in evidence being based on it. To the admission of this also, over their objection, appellants reserved exception, on the ground that all rights secured by the petition were merged in the judgment.
These rulings of the court are all assigned as error, and presented in appellants’ brief.
Appellees’ title depended on the sale under the execution, with which they connected themselves by mesne conveyances from the purchaser, no evidence of any other title being shown.
From these facts we conclude that the court below erred in admitting in evidence the copy of the will of Horton. It is settled in this State, that to authorize the admission of a will in evidence, an order of a proper court admitting it to probate must be produced or its absence accounted for. Lagow v. Glover, 77 Texas, 450.
This error, however, is not such as would necessarily lead to a reversal of the judgment, if appellees succeeded in showing a valid sale under the judgment against Horton’s estate.
The first point urged against that sale is, that the judgment did not warrant a sale of lands, but only of the effects of the estate, by which, appellants contend, is meant personal property.
Delivered October 18, 1892.
It is true that the word “ effects,” unaffected by context, is generally held to include only personal property. But when we consider the facts, that no distinction could properly have been made by the court render ing the judgment, between personal and real property of the estate, as both were equally subject to the debt, and that it was not necessary for the judgment to define what property, should be levied upon, further than to indicate that it should be satisfied out of property belonging to the estate, rather than that belonging to the executors individually, we can not conclude that by this direction more than this was intended. Its only purpose was to show that the assets of the estate, and not property of the individuals, who were executors, were to be subjected. The law gave execution and defined the property subject to fit.
This execution, however, did not command the sheriff to levy upon property of the estate, but upon that of Mrs. Horton and Dennis, describing them as executrix and executor. The levy was made upon the land, as the property of “ defendants.” The defendants named in the writ were Horton and Dennis. The additional description of them as executrix and executor did not supply the place of a direction in the writ to levy upon and sell property belonging to the estate, and there is not, either in the recitals or commands of the writ, anything to warrant the sheriff in assuming that property of the estate alone was subject, or to authorize him to levy upon such property.
In the case of Hart v. McDade, 61 Texas, land of an estate was sold under an execution, commanding the sheriff “ that of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of the said S. C. and B. M. Herndon, executors of the will of J. H. Herndon, deceased, you cause to be made,” etc., just as in this case. There were several defects in that sale, and, after disposing of them, Justice Stay ton says, on page 212: “If, however, all of these things had been shown, the execution would not have authorized the sale in form and manner drawn, for it uses no language indicating that it is to be satisfied out of property belonging to the estate of Herndon, or empowering the officer to seize and sell any property of that estate.” Appellees refer to many authorities to show that an execution will not, after a sale, and in collateral proceeding, be held void for irregularity, such as variances between it and the judgment in names, dates, etc. A clear distinction exists between defects which affect the power to sell, and those which do not. Appellees’ cases are of the latter class. This case belongs, as shown, to the former.
Appellants’ objection to the execution, levy, and sheriff’s deed should have been sustained, and as appellees showed no title without those documents. a new trial should have been granted.
The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.
Reversed and remanded."
219213,John B. Reagan et al. v. Van Evans et al.,1893-01-12,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
The statement of the nature and result of this suit is thus given by counsel for appellants in their brief:
“ This suit was brought by appellees, Van Evans and his wife Judith F. Evans, and John H. Evans, against the appellants, John B. Reagan, sheriff of Cherokee Count}'', and Borchard, Ehrlick & Co., a mercantile firm residing and doing business in Galveston County, and composed of M. Lasker, Dan Borchard, and David M. Ehrlick, in the District Court of Cherokee County, Texas, on the 25th day of November, 1891, to enjoin the said John B. Reagan, sheriff as aforesaid, from the execution of a writ of possession to lands described in their petition, which said writ was issued out of the District Court of Galveston County, and to remove cloud from title of said John H. Evans to said land.
‘ ‘Appellees’ petition alleged, substantially, that said Jonn H. Evans is the owner of the said land by virtue of title deraigned as follows: On the 23d of November, 1886, W. J. Addis sold said land to Judith F. Evans, wife of Van Evans, by deed of that date, and received therefor as the consideration in part a promissory note for $157.25, due January 1, 1889, payable to said Addis, or bearer, both said note and deed retaining the vendor’s lien upon said land. That said deed was filed for record in Cherokee County on the 17th day of May, 1889, and was duly recorded on May 20, 1889.
“That on the 1st day of January, 1891, the said John H. Evans, in due course of trade, for value, became the owner and holder of said note, and thereafter, on the 1st day of June, 1891, said John H. Evans obtained judgment in the District Court of said Cherokee County upon said note against Judith F. Evans and Van Evans for the amount of said note, less a credit of $50, and for interest and costs of suit, and a foreclosure of said vendor’s lien on said land and an order of sale of said land for the payment of said judgment. That thereafter, by virtue of said judgment and order of sale, said land was sold by John B. Reagan, as sheriff of said county, on the 4th day of August, 1891, to the said John H. Evans, by deed of that date, which was filed for record same day and duly recorded on the day following; that said John H. Evans within thirty days thereafter was placed in possession of said land.
“ Said petition further alleges the title of said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. to said land, which is deraigned as follows: That on the 24th day of January, 1890, and on the 8th day of February, 1890, the said Van Evans and Judith F. Evans made, executed, and delivered to the said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. their two several deeds of trust upon said land to secure the payment of certain sums of money then acknowledged by said Judith F. and Van Evans to be due and owing to said Borchard, Ehrlick <& Co.; that said deeds of trust were duly recorded in records of deeds of said Cherokee County on their several dates.
“ That on the 14th day of August, 1891, the said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. recovered a judgment against said Van Evans and Judith F. Evans in the District Court of Galveston County, Texas, for the sums of money secured by said deeds of trust, with interest and costs, and foreclosing the lien upon said land created and secured by said deeds of trust, and ordering said land to be sold to satisfy said judgment, and that the purchaser at said sale be put in possession, etc.
“ That thereafter, on the first Tuesday in October, 1891, said land was sold by said John B. Reagan, sheriff of said Cherokee County, under and by virtue of an order of sale issued out of the said District Court of said Galveston County, Texas, upon said last described judgment; and at said last mentioned sale said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. became the purchasers, and obtained from said sheriff his deed to said land, made by virtue of said last mentioned sale of same, said deed bearing date the 20th of October, 1891, and duly recorded in the clerk’s office of Cherokee County on same day. That the plaintiffs in said petition are in possession of said land. That said Borchard, Ehrlick & Go. claim the right of possession to said land by virtue of said title as aforesaid, and especially by virtue of the direction in said last named order of sale, ‘ that the sheriff do place the purchaser of said land in possession thereof.’
“And plaintiffs in said petition pray to have the writ of injunction made perpetual; that the title to said land be adjudged to be in said John H. Evans, and the deed from the sheriff to Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. be cancelled, and for all costs, etc.
“ The appellants excepted generally and specially to the petition, ajid pleaded specially to the jurisdiction of the court. And the court having, on the 1st day of July, A. D. 1892, overruled said general and special exceptions and said plea to the jurisdiction of said court, and having rendered its judgment against the appellants Borchard, Ehrlick & Co., appellants filed their motion for a new trial, and the court having overruled said motion for new trial, appellants gave notice of appeal.”
The appellants’ first assignment of error is, that e ‘ the court erred in overruling defendants’ plea to the jurisdiction of the court, because the ground of action against appellants set up in plaintiffs’ petition is an order of sale and writ of possession issued out of the District Court of Galveston County, and the relief prayed for in said petition is to perpetuate an injunction issued out of the District Court of Cherokee County, enjoining the sheriff of said Cherokee County from the execution of a writ aforesaid, issued out of the District Court of Galveston County, based upon a judgment obtained in the District Court of Galveston County in favor of appellants Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. against Judith F. Evans and Van Evans, and which said writ was made returnable to said District Court of Galveston County.”
The plaintiffs’ petition alleged, that the defendant Reagan, sheriff of Cherokee County, at the instigation of the other defendants, Borchard, Ehrlick & Co., was threatening to dispossess and eject plaintiffs Van and Judith Evans from the premises in controversy, under and by virtue of a writ issued from the District Court of Galveston County upon a judgment rendered therein on the 4th of August, A. D. 1891, in a suit wherein the said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. were plaintiffs and the said Van and Judith Evans were defendants, commanding said sheriff to sell said premises, and to place the purchasers in possession thereof; and that by virtue of said writ the said sheriff, as they were informed and believed, had sold said premises, and that at the sale the said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. became the purchasers. And petitioners further averred, that they were advised and believed that said writ was then functus officio; that it issued on the 11th day of August, A. D. 1891, and was made returnable within ninety days, which time had then elapsed; and they averred, that the said Reagan, instigated by his codefendants, would, they feared, execute his threat to eject them from said premises, unless restrained therefrom by a writ of injunction; that said Van and Judith Evans were in possession of the premises under a lease from their coplaintiff, John Evans; that they were occupying the same as a home, and had made their preparations so to occupy it, at least until the end of the next year, and if ejected by said sheriff that they would sustain irreparable injury. They alleged the rental value of the premises, and averred that the title, as they were advised and believed, under which they were holding possession of the premises was superior to that under which the said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. were asserting right to the property.
From these averments, if true (and in considering the rulings of the court upon the plea they must be taken as true, since the plea to the jurisdiction was not verified by affidavit, but appellants relied on the allegations of the petition for its verification), it is evident that the writ under which the sheriff was threatening to dispossess complainants had ceased by lapse of time to be of any force or effect. Such a writ has been repeatedly held to be void. Hester v. Duprey, 46 Texas, 625; Mitchell v. Ireland, 54 Texas, 301; Towns v. Harris, 13 Texas, 507.
If the writ prayed to be enjoined was void, the alleged threat of ejectment, if executed, would have been a trespass committed by the sheriff; and an injunction restraining an officer from committing a trespass can not be said to be an injunction enjoining the execution of the judgment upon which the writ issued, and if not, then the writ of injunction need not be returned to the court whence the order of sale and writ of possession emanated. We are of opinion, therefore, that the court did not err in holding the defendants’ plea to the jurisdiction to be bad.
As the appellant’s second assignment of error is not copied in his brief, and as he makes neither proposition nor statement under said assignment, we consider it as waived, and will not discuss the same.
The appellants’ third assignment of error impugns the correctness of' the ruling of the court upon appellants’ special exceptions to appellees’ first amended original petition, on these grounds: First. Because said amended petition sets up a different cause of action than that set up in original petition, and the relief prayed for in the amended petition could not have been granted under the averments of the original petition. Second. Because the petition shows upon its face that at the time the appellee John Evans became the owner of the alleged vendor’s lien note, and at the time of the judgment of the District Court of Cherokee County foreclosing said lien, and under which said appellee claims title to the land in controversy, the appellants, the said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co., were encumbrancers upon said land by virtue of two deeds of trust, mentioned in said petition, and as such encumbrancers, had the equity of redemption of said land, and that they were not parties to said suit in which said vendor’s lien was foreclosed; and that said petition neither discloses nor alleges any fact or facts which would bind appellants by said judgment or the sale made thereunder.
As to the first of these two grounds of objection urged to the judgment of the court overruling appellants’ special exception to the amended petition, it is sufficient, we think, to say, that the court had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject matter of the suit, and the petition presented a good cause of action; and even if the cause of action set out in the amended petition was another and a different one to that presented in the original petition, if was competent for the court to permit the suit to proceed under such terms and conditions as in its judgment were proper; and if the appellants were surprised by the averments of the amended petition, or for any other sufficient cause they desired a postponement or continuance of the cause, they should have made application to the court for such postponement or continuance; and not having done so, they can not now be heard to complain of the judgment of the court in overruling their exception.
The second ground of objection is based upon the assumption, that as the deeds of trust mentioned in plaintiffs’ petition showed that appellants Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. were encumbrancers before the purchase of the vendor’s lien note, and before the institution of his suit by the said appellee John Evans for the foreclosure of said lien, the said appellants were necessary parties to said suit, in order to convey title to appellee John Evans under the decree of foreclosure. The vendor’s lien was expressly retained in the deed conveying the land from J. Addis to Edith Evans, under whom both appellants and appellee John Evans claim title.
Had Addis brought suit on the note, it is well settled by the decisions of the Supreme Court of this State, that appellants would not have been necessary parties. Ufford v. Wells, 52 Texas, 619, and authorities there cited; Silberberg v. Pearson, 75 Texas, 288. And as Addis, the assignor of the note, held the superior legal title to the land in trust for the benefit of his assignee, we think the rule announced in the cases cited, supra, is as applicable to this case as if the vendor, Addis, were the plaintiff, instead of his assignee, John Evans.
But if we are mistaken in this, unless Evans knew of the subsequent lien acquired by the mortgagees, Borchard, Ehrlick & Co., then he was not required to make them parties to his suit to foreclose the vendor’s lien. Webb v. Maxan, 11 Texas, 340. And there is nothing in the record which shows, or would authorize us to conclude, that Evans, the plaintiff, knew of the mortgages executed by the vendee of the land to Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. at the time he instituted his suit. The mortgagees were not in possession of the premises. The registration of the mortgages was not notice to plaintiff. He was not asserting or claiming any rights under the mortgagor. The registration of the vendor’s deed was notice to the subsequent encumbrancers of the vendor’s lien, but the registration of the mortgages executed by the vendee was not notice of the mortgagee’s lien, to either the vendor or to the vendor’s assignee.
Our conclusion is, therefore, that the mortgagees were not necessary parties to the suit for foreclosing the vendor’s lien, and that the judgment must be affirmed. But it is the opinion of the majority of the court, that the mortgagees, the appellants here, are not precluded by the judgment of the lower court from yet asserting any equities against the land secured to them by their mortgages, a proposition to which the writer of this opinion is not prepared to give his assent.
The judgment therefore is affirmed without prejudice to appellants. And if the land be of greater value than the amount of the plaintiff Evans’ debt, such excess of value, or so much thereof as may be necessary, may be subjected to the payment of appellants’ mortgage debts.
Affirmed.

216224,Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. John Hohn,1892-10-18,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
This is an appeal from a judgment for $15,000, recovered by appellee against appellant, in the District Court of Gregg County, for personal injuries' sustained by appellee while in the service of appellant in the capacity of brakeman.
As no question arises on the pleadings except that appellant claims there was a variance between the allegation and the proof as to the manner in which appellee received his injury, it is unnecessary to state them, except so far as they relate to that question.
The petition on this point alleged in substance, that while ascending a ladder on the side of one of the cars of a moving train, appellee was struck by a beam or piece of timber which projected too near the road for safety of employes, from a tank standing near the road, which was a part and appendage of the road. It was alleged that the tank was negligently constructed, and that it was an obstruction to the track, which rendered it unsafe and dangerous to employes whose business it was to be on the outside of the trains.
The facts which we find to be established are: That a tank had formerly stood where the injury occurred, but had been blown down and disused for some time; that two or three weeks before appellee was injured workmen were put to repairing and rebuilding it; that in the process of repairing they had to erect temporary staging around it, which was somewhat nearer the track than was the tank; that the evidence does not show that either the tank or the main body of the scaffold was too near the track, but does establish the fact that a piece of timber projected from the scaffolding to within a few inches (not more than eight) of pass-, ing trains. This timber was put there by the employes working upon the tank, and was shown to have been there on the day before the appellee was hurt. It was not necessary for it to project out as it did from the scaffolding, and it was dangerous to brakemen whose duties required them to be on the outside of cars and to ascend ladders along their sides while trains were in motion.
Appellee, at Mesquite, got off the train to uncouple a car which was to be left on the siding and recouple the engine to the train. When he had done this he was near the engine of a long train, which began to move off. Seeing that if he waited until the caboose, which was his station when he was not required to be outside the cars, reached him, that the train would be going too fast for him to mount it, he climbed upon a flat car which was passing him, and walked back along the tops of the cars towards the caboose. He reached a stock car, called an Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe car, which was taller than the others, and had no ladder at its end, but had one at its south side near the end. He got upon this ladder and began to ascend it, and as he approached the top he saw the timber projecting from the tank. He threw his head towards the car, but was struck by the timber and knocked to the ground. The evidence shows that brakemen are required to perform duties which necessitate their being on the outside of cars, and this act of appellant in mounting the train in motion and going back to the caboose along the tops of the cars was customary under such circumstances. Appellant had not seen the tank since the work of repairing began. He had been off the road for about ten days before he was hurt, and passed over it going west the day before for the first time after the rebuilding commenced. His position on the train was then such as to prevent him from seeing the tank, and he did not in fact see it. The tank was about one-half mile east of the siding at Mesquite. Prior to his injury appellee was making from $65 to $70 per month. His injuries were serious; his skull broken, his hip knocked in and crushed, his spine seriously impaired, his urinary organs seriously and permanently deranged. His strength has been so depleted that he has to walk with crutch or stick, and he can walk but a short distance without stopping to rest. From the time of his injuries up to this time he has undergone great suffering, both physical and mental. His sleep is but partial, and his rest at night very imperfect. He is now unfit for any kind of business, and has to take medicine all the time, and his condition does not improve thereby: He is. a constant sufferer of most acute pain. His digestion is so enfeebled and his appetite so impoverished that he is greatly reduced in flesh and strength, with greatly impaired disposition to sleep. His internal injuries are of such a character as to cause great pain, and medical skill and remedies are alike unavailing to give relief, and his doctor stated that his injuries will continue through life, and that in the meantime the appellee will undergo sufferings as heretofore, and that it is only a matter of very little time when death will result from them.
Appellant’s first assignment of error complains of the refusal of a special charge, that if ‘ ‘ the timbers that struck plaintiff were the timbers of a temporary scaffolding, erected by the employes of defendant in order to build or repair the tank, and no part of the permanent structure injured plaintiff,” then the jury would find for the defendant, “because the negligence of the employes who constructed the temporary scaffolding was the negligence of those persons who were fellow servants with plaintiff, and he can not recover for their negligence.”
The second assignment is, that the court erred in not granting a new trial, because the verdict is not supported by the evidence; in this, the evidence showed that it was a plank of a temporary scaffolding at the water tank that struck plaintiff, and no part of the water tank struck him.
The proposition involved in the special charge is, that the mere fact that the timber which struck appellee was part of a temporary structure erected for the purpose of repairing the tank would defeat appellee’s action.
Appellant owed duties to its employes, not only in the construction or repair of the tank, but also in the keeping of its track cleared of dangerous obstructions. Reasonable care was required of the company to see that this was done. It had the right to repair its tank, but this in nowise modified or conflicted with its duty with reference to the track. It was still its duty to discover, and within reasonable time remove, any obstruction of the track dangerous to the employes, however it may have come there, whether by the act of a servant, or by that of a stranger, or by accident.
The charge requested required the jury to find for appellant, though the projecting timber which struck appellee may have been in nowise necessary to the work that was being done, and though it may have been left there so long before the injury that the company could with due care have discovered and had it removed.
Whether the negligence of which the workmen were guilty in putting the timber so near the track was originally imputable to the company or not (as a failure to observe its duty to furnish to its servants a reasonably safe place at which to work), it is clear to our minds that it would be culpable negligence in the company to allow so dangerous a contrivance to remain in such position after it had discovered its presence, or ought by the exercise of proper care to have done so. There was evidence, as • above stated, which made it proper for the court to submit this question to the jury, and its refusal to give the special charge, the effect of which would have been to withdraw the issue from them, was correct.
Appellant’s counsel in his argument contends that there is a difference between permanent structures along a railroad and such temporary ones as are put up in the process of repairing; and that negligence in the construction or position of the former would be that of the railway company, while negligence in the arrangement of the temporary structure would be that of the servant performing the work, and that none of his fellow servants injured by it could hold the master liable. In support of this he cites a passage in Bishop’s Non-Contract Law, as follows: ‘1 Where a railroad bridge was in process of repairs, and by reason of it a train stopped at an unusual place on the bridge, and a brakeman fell through it, the road was held not to be liable, and plainly in such a case the temporary imperfections incident to a repair are not within the general rule.”
As we understand the proposition, it means no more than that a railway company must repair its track and is not guilty of negligence if there are imperfections in it which result necessarily from the process of repairing. The case referred to by Mr. Bishop is Koontz v. Railway, 65 Iowa, 224, and in that case it is said that the master must in making repairs exercise ordinary care, and it is held that the facts of that case did not show negligence on the part of the railway company. Armour v. Hahn, 111 United States, 318, also referred to by the appellant’s counsel, is a case in which one of several workmen engaged in building a house stepped upon a stick of timber projecting from an unfinished brick wall, fell, and was hurt. The timber had been left in that condition by fellow servants of the plaintiff and was placed as was usual in such cases. The gist of that decision is contained in one sentence of Justice Gray’s opinion: 6 6 The obligation of a master to provide reasonably safe places and structures for his servants to work upon does not impose upon him the duty, as toward them, of keeping a building which they are employed in erecting in a safe condition at every moment of their work, so far as the safety depends upon the due performance of that work by them and their fellows.” He further says: “If it (the timber') was at the time insecure, it was either by reason of the risk ordinarily incident to the state of things, in the unfinished condition of the building or else by reason of some negligence of a fellow servant.”
The cases of Davis v. Railway, 28 American and English Railway Cases, 448, and Clark v. Railway, Id., 84, are clearly in conflict with decisions of our Supreme Court (Oram v. Railway, 49 Texas, 345; Bonner v. La None, 80 Texas, 119), and the doctrine of the latter case is condemned by standard elementary writers. Bish. Non-Con. Law, sec. 649; Beach on Con. Neg., sec. 134. The first case holds that a brakeman knocked from the ladder of a freight car while in motion by a tank too close to the track can not recover; and the latter holds that a servant struck by the timbers of a bridge too low to allow him to pass safely on the top of the cars has no remedy, because he assumed the risk.
It is to be remarked, however, that the right to recover in such cases depends upon other facts besides the defective construction of the bridge or tank, as in the case of Railway v. Wallace, 76 Texas, 637.
The other authorities referred to are all cases in which the injury resulted from negligence of fellow servants and from no failure of duty on the part of the master. Schaub v. Railway, 16 S. W. Rep., 92; Holden v. Railway, 129 Mass., 268. They are all clearly distinguishable from this case. Had the workmen engaged in repairing the tank done a negligent act which at once injured appellee without rendering the track unsafe, certainly appellee could not hold appellant liable therefor, because the negligence would have been that of a fellow servant. But when the negligent act of the servant consisted in rendering dangerous the track, which it was appellant’s duty to use ordinary care to keep clear of obstructions, it might be a question whether such negligence would not from the first be charged to the master. However that may be, a failure to discover and remove a dangerous object overhanging or projecting near to the track within reasonable time would be negligence on the part of the master, as well where such condition was the result of the acts of servants as if it resulted from any other cause.
The facts showed that the timber was there on the day before the injury, when the same train passed going west, and reached so close to the engine that the engineer removed his screen to save it from ruin. In view of the well known fact that the railroad companies find it necessary to make frequent and oft-repeated inspections of their road, and the opportunities thus afforded for discovering such dangers as this was, we think that the question was properly left to the jury to determine whether or not this should have been discovered and removed by appellant before appellee was hurt.
Appellant’s counsel insists that in repairing the tank appellant was bound only to provide against such mishaps as could be apprehended by use- of ordinary foresight, and that it could not have anticipated that appellee, at that point, would be ascending a ladder on the south side of a car as it passed the tank.
The evidence showed that the brakemen had to be on top of the cars, and at times to ascend and descend the ladders while the cars were in motion, and that it was customary for them to do so when situated as was appellee. This made it obligatory upon appellant to know that a timber as close to the track as this would endanger the lives of its employes when thus engaged, and it is bound to accept the proximate consequences of its negligence in leaving it there. The injury to appellee was such a consequence. If appellant was not bound to foresee that this timber at this tank would hurt appellee, it was not bound to anticipate that such a timber at any other point of the road would hurt any other servant.
Delivered October 18, 1892.
The jury having found negligence, we think that the evidence is sufficient to warrant the finding.
There is no material variance between the allegation and proof as to the manner in and means by which appellee was hurt.
The third assignment is, that the evidence did not show that the tank was too near the track, and a new trial should therefore have been granted. The evidence did show that the beam was too close to the track, and that this was the cause of the injury.
Appellant contends that appellee was guilty of contributo’ry negligence in climbing upon the car as he did, and in not having seen the timber at the tank. We think that the evidence sufficiently showed that appellee acted as was usual, and as brakemen were expected to act in such situations; and that he had no opportunity of learning the condition of the tank and the attachments before he was hurt.
The fifth assignment is, that the damages awarded by the jury are excessive. While the amount is large, appellee’s injuries are extraordinary. His pitiable plight was stated in great detail by himself and his attending physician. No witnesses contradicted them, and their testimony establishes an extent of injury and severity of suffering rarely seen. We do ■not think the verdict so large as to require that we set it aside.
No complaint is made of the charge of the court nor of the evidence, except in the points already considered; and no error in the judgment being made to appear, it is affirmed.

219054,"Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company v. J. C. Cooper",1893-01-12,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
Action to recover damages for personal injuries, brought by the appellee in the District Court of Fort Bend County against the appellant. This is the second appeal; the first will be found reported in 70 Texas, 67.
Plaintiff alleged, that he received the injuries on May 9,1885, while a passenger on defendant’s line of railroad going from Rosenberg to Alley-ton, at Randon, an intermediate station, where he had got off the cars on to the platform to deliver a message with which he was charged to some one there; that while he was attempting to get aboard of the train again, he was thrown down by reason of the negligence of defendant’s servants who were operating the train, in suddenly and violently starting the train without the usual signals; and his left foot and ankle were so crushed and broken that it became necessary to have his leg amputated below the knee. He also alleged, that prior to the injuries he was engaged in the business and occupation of a stockman, by which he earned the sum of 81500 annually; that in consequence' of his injuries he had been crippled for life, and wholly disabled from ever pursuing his occupation, which was the only business for which he<was qualified; that he was 46 years of age and in good health, and would probably live twenty-five years longer.
Defendant demurred to so much of the petition as set up plaintiff’s 6i worldly condition ” and the probability of his life and his annual earnings; and also answered by a general denial and plea of contributory negligence.
On the trial the demurrer was overruled by the court, and the case went to a jury, which returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for 815,000, and judgment was rendered accordingly.
Several assignments of error complain of the action of the court in overruling the demurrer, and in admitting evidence and charging the jury with reference to the expectancy of life and the earnings of plaintiff, because death had not ensued from the injury, nor had the earning capacity of the plaintiff been entirely destroyed. It is also contended, that there is error in the giving and refusal of charges with respect to the degvee of care exacted of the defendant towards the plaintiff; and that the-damages awarded are grossly excessive.
We find the facts to be:
1. At night, on May 9, 1885, the plaintiff, J. C. Cooper, on his return from the town of Wharton, where he had been attending court, to his home near Alleyton, Colorado County, purchased a ticket from the defendant company at Rosenberg, on the line of defendant’s road, for passage over said railway from Rosenberg to Alleyton, going west, and entered the cars for the purpose of going to Alleyton.
2. Plaintiff had been charged by some one with a message to be delivered to Tom Jones, who was camped with his crowd of cow drivers at Randon, which was an intermediate station between Rosenberg and Alley-ton, about seven miles west of Rosenberg. When the train reached Ran-don it stopped in a position so as to leave the last two cars of the train alongside of the depot platform. Plaintiff was in the next to the last car, and as soon as the train stopped he got off the rear end of the car on the platform and stood near the car steps and called for Jones, and delivered the message for him to some one in the crowd who had answered-that Jones was asleep. Plaintiff turned to get back on the train, which was standing still, and just as he leaned forward and seized one of the iron rails put on the coach for the purpose of assisting passengers to board the train, with his right hand, and was in the act of seizing the other rail with his left hand, the train started without any warning, and plaintiff was thrown down under the train, and the wheels of the cars ran over his foot and ankle, crushing the same so that the foot had to be amputated below the knee.
3. Plaintiff testified, that the train was suddenly and violently started, thereby suddenly and violently jerking him down and under the train, about three or four fqet east from the west end of the platform, and between the train and the platform; and that no notice whatever was given that the train was about to start before it was started. Neither was the engine bell rung nor the whistle blown, nor did the conductor say “ all aboard.” If notice had been .given, plaintiff would have had a plenty of time to get back on the train in safety. Witnesses for the defendant testified, that the train was not started with a sudden jerk, because Miller couplings were used, and when they are used the train does not start with a jerk. They testified to their belief that notice of starting was given, but could not say so positively. We find that the train was started quickly and without warning.
4. At the time of the accident Randon was a flag station on the defendant’s line of railway. A flag station is a station at which the trains of the defendant are not stopped unless there is some one on the train who desires to get off at the station, or the train is flagged by some one at the station desiring to get on. It is not the custom to stop unless the train has been flagged, or there is some one aboard to be put off there. At the time of the accident there was at Eandon a depot, platform, and waiting room; also a section house, stock pens, and a water tank; but no agent or telegraph operator. The stop made on the night of the accident at Eandon was for water. The train had not been signalled for any one to get on, and there was no passenger to get off. Defendant’s employes who were operating the train did not know that plaintiff had gotten off. When the train drew near to the station the engine whistled. Plaintiff had often gotten off and on defendant’s train at Eandon, and never had to notify the conductor or signal the train. He always considered it a regular passenger station.
5. Plaintiff was taken to Eichmond for treatment on the morning of May 10, where he had skilled physicians and surgeons to attend him. His foot and ankle became so badly inflamed and irritated that on May 15 it became necessary to amputate his leg about half-way between the ankle and knee. He was confined to his bed about two months, and suffered greatly. His expense for board, medical treatment, nurses’ hire, and incidental expenses in getting cured, amounted to 81040. Plaintiff’s occupation was that of a stockman, and had been such from early boyhood. He was 46 years of age, and was strong and healthy, and was in good health at the time of the trial, and in a robust condition except as to his amputated leg. His expectation of life at the time of the accident, according to mortality tables, was twenty-three years. He had not pursued any other occupation than that of stockman, and his education was limited. He was expert in his business, and earned from 81500 to 82000 annually, besides attending to his own cattle and horses and other business about his place. Stockmen testified that a man as he was before the injury ought to earn from 8800 to 81000 a year, but that his capacity as a stockman had been destroyed. By reason of the injury plaintiff’s earning capacity was shown to be practically destroyed. He could not do anything in the line of stockman or boss cow driver, because he could not get about, and mount his horse and ride as before. He testified that he could not plow nor hoe, nor perform any other labor he thought himself capable of doing; that since the injury he had not been able to perform any kind of labor, nor had he made any money since the accident.
1. There was no error in overruling defendant’s demurrer to the petition. Plaintiff’s capacity to pursue his accustomed employment was at least permanently impaired, if not permanently destroyed; and in order to show the damage that he has sustained, and the extent of the injury, it was proper to show that he was engaged in a particular business, and the loss from the incapacity to pursue that business. The loss is the difference between what the annual earnings were before the injury and what they would be, if any, with the diminished capacity; and when it has been shown that the injury is permanent, as was done in the case of the plaintiff, it is proper to show what the expectation of life is, so as to enable the jury to form an estimate as nearly as possible of what the damage or loss may be. Hence there could be no error in admitting evidence to show what the plaintiff’s occupation or business was, and what his annual, earnings from his occupation had been prior to the injury. Wade v. Leroy, 20 How., 34; Luck v. Ripon, 52 Wis., 196; Nebraska City v. Campbell, 2 Black, 590; 3 Suth. on Dam., 261-265, 716-723; Indianapolis v. Gaston, 58 Ind., 224; Welch v. Ware, 32 Mich., 77; George v. Haverhill, 110 Mass., 506; Elkhart v. Ritter, 66 Ind., 136; Railway v. Putnam, 118 U. S., 554.
In the last named case the court said: “ In an action for a personal injury, the plaintiff is entitled to recover compensation, so far as it is susceptible of an estimate in money, for the loss and damage caused to him by the defendant’s negligence, including not only expenses incurred for medical attendance, and a reasonable sum for his pain and suffering, but also a fair recompense for the loss of what he would otherwise have earned in his trade or profession, and has been deprived of the capacity of earning by the wrongful act of the defendant.”
We are of the opinion that in order to show the extent of plaintiff’s injuries, it was proper to show in connection with the evidence that the injury was of a permanent character, and what his annual earnings had been, and what the probable duration of plaintiff’s life was. It is impossible for a jury to determine with any degree of exactness what damage has been sustained in cases of personal injuries, and it must be approximated by the aid of such evidence as will tend to show what it is; and having first ascertained how much the capacity for earning money has been diminished by an annual estimate, it would then become a proper subject of inquiry, how long the plaintiff would likely live. The testimony of the actuary, that a healthy man forty-six years old would probably live twenty-three and four one-hundredths years, was admissible. We are aware that it was held in Railway v. Douglass, 69 Texas, 694, that the rule seemed to be that when death results from the injury, or when the evidence tends to show that the earning capacity is entirely destroyed, the testimony is admissible, otherwise not. In support of this proposition the court cited, Pierce on Railroads, 297; Wilson v. Railway, 38 Iowa, 364; McDonald v. Railway, 26 Iowa, 139. Mr. Pierce states the proposition broadly, that “in actions for injuries not resulting in death, life tables are not competent evidence of the probable injury;” but he is not sustained by any authority to which we have had access. The case in 26 Iowa, supra, is where there were injuries to the wife, “ permanent in their nature, and likely to disable her during her life from rendering effectual service to her husband and family in the discharge of her household duties; and that in consequence a woman had been and was, and probably would have to be, employed to do the work she had been accustomed to perform.” Held, that under the circumstances there was no error in the admission of the Carlisle tables to show the expectancy of the life of the wife.
In Railway v. Putnam, supra, standard life and annuity tables, showing at any age the probable duration of life, and the present value of a life annuity, were held to be competent evidence in order to assist the jury in making an estimate of a fair recompense to the plaintiff “ for the loss of what he would otherwise have earned in his trade or profession.” The injuries to the plaintiff in that case were, “his collar bone, shoulder-blade, and several ribs were broken, and his sight, hearing, ease of breathing, and his capacity to do business impaired.” He was an adjuster by profession, and his capacity to do business was impaired because he could not travel around as he formerly could, and was compelled to remain in an office, where he earned much less. Notwithstanding the case of Railway v. Douglass, supra, we are constrained to hold that under the circumstances the evidence was admissible. See rule intimated by Judge Bonner in Railway v. Willie, 53 Texas, 328; also City of Lincoln v. Smith, 45 N. W. Rep., 44.
From what has been said it also follows, that we do not think there was any error as complained under the twelfth and fourteenth assignments of error. The twelfth assignment is, that the court erred in its charge on the measure of damages in submitting the “loss of future earning power,” and ‘ ‘ should have qualified the language so as to submit the question as one of total loss of earning power.”
The fourteenth assignment is based on the following paragraph of the charge: “ The evidence adduced touching the age, probable expectancy of life, and earnings of the plaintiff may be considered by the jury, if they find for the plaintiff, along with all the other evidence, in arriving at what loss, if any, plaintiff has sustained from diminished earnings since the injury and loss of earning power; but the jury will not understand from this that they can from such facts fix a basis of computation without regard to plaintiff’s capacity, if any, to earn money since the injuries and in the future; nor are such facts, if proved, to be considered otherwise than as circumstances to be weighed by the jury, with all the other evidence, in arriving at a fair and just pecuniary compensation for the loss to plaintiff, if any, resulting directly from the injuries received.”
It appears from the paragraph of the charge above quoted that the effect of the evidence touching the plaintiff’s age and probable expectancy of life was properly limited. Railway v. Putnam, 118 U. S., 554.
2. The refusal of the following requested instruction by the court has been assigned as error: “ The contract of a railway company as a carrier is to carry a passenger to his point of destination, and not to afford him opportunities to leave the car at intermediate stations, except at stopping places for refreshments; and if a passenger alights at such intermediate stations or stopping places, unless the servants of the carrier actually know the fact, or unless the servants of the carrier are ignorant through negligence, they are not bound to more than their usual care and watchfulness in starting the trains from such stations or stopping places. And if you believe from the evidence that plaintiff, Cooper, got off the train, at night at Eandon, an intermediate station or stopping place, and not the place he was bound for; that the train stopped there for water only; that it was not a regular passenger station; that the train men knew that no other passenger was to get on or off there at that time, and that was a fact; that the train men did not know that Cooper had gotten off there, and their ignorance was not through negligence on their part, and that they started the train from Eandon in the usual careful way, without any negligence on their part, you will find for defendant.”
Some authorities hold, that the relation of carrier and passenger continues until the journey has been concluded, and that the passenger is entitled to protection while he is temporarily absent from the cars at a way station for a proper purpose. Packet Co. v. True, 88 Ill., 608; Railway v. Riley, 39 Ind., 568; Mitchell v. Railway, 30 Ga., 27. The exception that the passenger may alight for refreshments is well established; but we do not see, when the train stops at a station, why a passenger may not alight, using proper care, for a proper purpose, as speaking to some one on the platform, as in this case. This would be a reasonable implication from the contract of carriage. Again, it has been held, that when a train stops at a passenger depot there is an implied invitation to alight, and in starting the train again every reasonable precaution should be taken to prevent injury to any passenger who should alight, whilst getting off or back on the train, such as giving warning of the starting of the train by customary signals.
We do not think that the evidence here presents a case coming within the decisions holding that when the train stops elsewhere than at a station, as at a water tank or upon a side track, when the stop is made for the purposes of the railroad alone, and the passenger leaves the cars, he acts at his peril, and that his own negligence will prevent a recovery. It may be true that Eandon was only a flag station, but it was a station for passengers to get on and off, and there was a depot and platform there, and the undisclosed purpose of the train men to stop there for water alone-could not change the character of the station; and if the plaintiff exercised care in attempting to get aboard the train after he had alighted, he was guilty of no a'ct of negligence that would prevent a recovery for injuries caused by the negligence of the defendant’s servants in starting the train. These views we do not think are in conflict with Railway v. Foreman, 73 Texas, 314.
Plaintiff was certainly entitled to have the degree of care exercised towards him, as enunciated in the charge of the court, as follows: “In this case the duty of defendant toward the plaintiff was to use such care to avoid injuring him as an ordinarily prudent and skillful person engaged in its business would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances; failing in which to plaintiff’s injury, it would be guilty of negligence, otherwise not. If the jury believe from the evidence that defendant’s employes observed such care and skill in starting the train as an ordinarily prudent person in like business would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances, or if the jury believe that the injuries complained of were not the natural and probable consequences of starting the train as done, nor such consequence as defendant’s employes in charge might reasonably have anticipated as likely to flow from such starting of the train, then return a verdict for defendant.”
This charge did not impose any greater degree of- duty upon the defendant than the exercise of ordinary care, which is finally the degree of care imposed by the requested instruction. So there could be no error in refusing to give the instruction informing the jury as to the nature of the contract and the effect of a stoppage at an intermediate station, because the instruction admits the obligation of defendant to the same degree of care as contained in the charge of the court, and the case at least, depends on the fact as to whether or not defendant’s servants used due care in starting the train.
3. As it was shown by the evidence that Eandon was a passenger depot, although a flag station, the refusal of the charge requested, that “a higher degree of care is required of train men at a passenger depot than at stopping places for water only,” was not error; and it was immaterial, so far as the facts of this case are concerned, whether the train was stopped for water only or to take on or put off passengers, and no instruction was. called for making any such distinction. ,
4. Appellant’s ninth assignment shows no error. It is as follows: “The court erred in refusing to give the following charge asked by defendant, viz.: ‘ It is not negligence in itself to start a train from a passenger depot without ringing a bell, or blowing a whistle, or saying 6 (all aboard.” The question of negligence must be determined from a consideration of all the facts in evidence in the case, and not simply by the question of whether or not the bell was rung, or the whistle blown, or “ all aboard” called out by the conductor.’ And in giving the above with the following qualification attached to it, to-wit: 6 The law does not undertake to declare what act or omission amounts to negligence, but it is for a jury to say, from a consideration of all the evidence, whether a given act or omission amounts to negligence, under the law’s definition and explanation of negligence as is given in the court’s charge.’ The qualification having the effect of allowing the jury to consider the omission to ring the bell, etc., to be of itself negligence, and of destroying the meaning of the charge requested.”
The requested charge was given with the qualification.
5. The fifteenth assignment of error, that “the court should have granted a new trial, because the verdict of the jury is contrary to the preponderance of the evidence upon every issue submitted to the court, and to the law as applied to the issues by the court,” is too general, and not in compliance with the rules.
6. While the verdict is a large one, we do not feel authorized to reverse the judgment on that account. Plaintiff paid out a large sum of money for board, medical attendance, and nurses; he suffered a great deal; was confined to his bed about two months; and the evidence shows that his business has been broken up, and that his capacity for earning money has been almost totally impaired.
We do not think the charge subject to the criticism made in the tenth assignment of error; and the complaint in the fifth assignment is not sustained by the record. Although evidence as to value of an annuity would have been admissible, the witness Houston did not testify as to what the value was. .
There being no error in the record, the judgment of the court below will be affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered January 12, 1893."
216250,J. K. Bordages v. William and Mary Higgins,1892-10-27,"MARR, Judge.
The counsel for the appellant state the nature and result of the suit as follows:
“This suit is an action of trespass to try title, brought by appellant against appellees, by petition in the usual form, filed in the District Court of Jefferson County, May 5, 1891; the land sued for is part of lot 193, in block 39, in the city of Beaumont, in Jefferson County. The cause was tried without a jury by the District Court of Jefferson County, at its May term, 1891, and judgment rendered for appellees, William Higgins and Mary Higgins. Appellant Bordages appeals.
‘ ‘Appellant claims said premises under a judgment of the District Court of Jefferson County, rendered at its November term, 1890, in cause 1180, The City of Beaumont v. William Higgins and Mary Higgins. This judgment fixed a lien on the premises in controversy, in favor of the city, for local assessments for a sidewalk constructed in front of the said premises by the city, and ordered the premises in controversy sold as under execution. The appellant was the purchaser at such sale, and this suit is for possession of the premises.
“The District Court held the judgment of the same court previously rendered open to collateral attack; that its judgment foreclosing a lien on the property for local assessments for the construction of sidewalks was void, because such local assessments were not taxes, and no other lien existed on which said judgment could be based.”
The language used by the court below in its conclusions of law does not expressly justify the statement of counsel that the court held its former judgment “ subject to collateral attack and void,” but its decision as rendered in this case leads indubitably to the conclusion as drawn by counsel. The court found “that the judgment under which the sale of the property in controversy was made could not be attacked in this proceeding;” but as the court had found, as “ a conclusion of fact,” that the local assessments imposed by the city of Beaumont upon the property were not taxes within the meaning of the constitutional provision allowing a homestead to be sold for the taxes due thereon, the court, therefore, held in effect that the sale of the property was invalid, and gave judgment for the defendants.
How the court reached this last conclusion without overturning or ignoring the former judgment of the District Court which authorized the sale of the property as it was subsequently made, we do not comprehend.
The property in dispute is the homestead of the appellees, and has been for many years, and the local assessments or improvements were made thereupon by the city in the year 1890, at a cost of $20. The city of Beaumont is incorporated under the general laws, and in pursuance of the authority granted to such cities by articles 375 and 376 of the Revised Statutes, in the year 1889 passed an ordinance, through its common council, regulating the construction of pavements and sidewalks in the city, and the mode and manner of making the same, as well as of fixing the liability of the owners of the abutting property. The ordinance in effect, like the statute, provided that <6 the cost of the construction of any sidewalk erected by the city shall be defrayed by the owner of the lot, or part of lot or block, fronting on the sidewalk;” and further, that the assessment should create a lien on the property to secure such assessments and the costs of collection, for which it might be sold; and that the lien could be foreclosed by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction in default of payment, etc.
The ordinance moreover required due notice to the owner, and gave him the right to erect the improvements as designated by the city; but if he failed to do so, then the city should construct them at his expense. In this case it appears that the appellees were duly notified to construct the sidewalk in front of their lot; but failing to do so, the city then erected the same. Upon the failure of the appellees to pay the costs of the sidewalk as erected by the city, the latter filed its suit in the District Court of the county by a petition, which seems to contain all of the essential averments to give the court jurisdiction and to authorize the foreclosure of the lien claimed by the city upon the property in that case. All of the facts and proceedings were duly alleged, and each of the appellees was duly cited by personal service, as provided by law in any ordinary civil suit, to appear and defend the action. They made default, and the District Court gave judgment against them and in favor of the city, foreclosing the lien upon the part of the lot owned by the defendants, and directed it to be sold as under execution to satisfy the amount of $20 (which the court found to be due the city), and the costs of the proceeding. A venditioni exponas issued upon the judgment, and the property in controversy was duly sold and conveyed to the appellant by the sheriff under the writ and judgment, for the sum of $27.50, which was the total amount of the assessment and the costs of court.
The appellant, among others, presents the following assignments of error:
1. “The court erred in holding that the judgment of the District Court, the order of sale, the sheriff’s return thereon, in cause No. 1180, The City of Beaumont v. William and Mary Higgins, and the sheriff’s deed made to plaintiff in pursuance thereof, under all of which plaintiff claimed the premises in controversy, did not vest the fee simple title of said premises in the plaintiff.”
2. “The court erred in holding that sidewalk assessments were unconstitutional and could not be enforced against the homestead.”
We are constrained to hold that both of these assignments are well taken. It is no longer an open question in this State, that local assessments for pavements or sidewalks, or other improvements of a similar character, when imposed and levied by a city, according to law, upon the abutting property, are special taxes for which the homestead may be sold as other lands in the mode which may be provided by law.
The homestead may be subjected to forced sale under the Constitution for taxes due thereon, and it has been several times decided by the Supreme Court that those local assessments, if regularly laid, will create a lien upon even the homestead, of which the District Court, under the Constitution, has ample jurisdiction, and may foreclose the same. We bow to these decisions, and hold that the homestead of the appellees was not protected b)r the Constitution from these taxes, or assessments. Lufkin v. Galveston, 58 Texas, 549; Wood v. Galveston, 76 Texas, 126; Adams v. Fisher, 63 Texas, 654; same case, 75 Texas, 657; Allen v. Galveston, 51 Texas, 302; Roundtree v. Galveston, 42 Texas, 613. Were it otherwise, however, the judgment of the District Court foreclosing the lien in the original suit between the city and the appellees would preclude any inquiry into the validity of the assessment and lien, upon this collateral proceeding, as will be understood as we proceed.
The appellees insist that that judgment is void, because the ordinance of the city of Beaumont, which we have already outlined, was likewise void. The ordinance, among other things, provided that the sidewalks should be constructed of “ brick, stone, or wood, or such other material as may be designated by the committee on bridges and streets, the committee to be composed of three aldermen, and to be appointed by the mayor.” This, it is claimed, was a delegation by the common council of a part of its legislative power and control over the subject to others, and in violation of law. Perhaps this position is entirely correct, and it seems to be supported by authority. Thompson v. Schermerhorn, 6 N. Y. App., 92. Still, if the question were before us in such way that we would be required to decide it, we might hold, that after rejecting this provision of the ordinance, enough would remain to accomplish the purpose of the act, and to justify its execution. The sidewalk which was erected upon the land in dispute was constructed of wood, one of the materials specified in the ordinance. But however this may be, we must hold that the judgment of the District Court in the original suit, as already suggested, is conclusive of this question, and of all others of like character which might have been invoked against that judgment in some direct attack upon it, or as reasons why it should not have been pronounced in the first instance, had the appellees appeared and contested the original proceedings.
We are aware of no well considered case in which it has been held by any court of last resort that a judgment of a court of record and of general jurisdiction, rendered in a controversy where the court had regularly acquired jurisdiction over the subject matter and the person of the defendant, is absolutely void or subject to collateral attack for even errors of law apparent upon the face of the record. The erroneous decisions of the court upon questions of law are just as final and binding as would be its erroneous determinations of questions of fact arising upon the evidence. Such judgments are, at most, only voidable in some appellate or revisory proceeding. In this case we have discovered no fatal irregularity even in the proceedings in the original suit, as already intimated, were we called upon to review the same.
Freeman correctly states the law upon the question in hand in the following language:
“Jurisdiction being obtained over the person and over the subject matter, no error in its exercise can make the judgment void. The authority to decide being shown, it can not be divested by being improperly or incorrectly employed. Error of decision may be corrected, but not so as to reach those who have relied in good faith upon its correctness.” (This sentence relates to direct attacks.) “ The same rules apply to actions to recover delinquent taxes as in other cases, in respect to collateral attacks. It can not be shown, to avoid the effects of such judgments, that the taxes were previously paid. Neither will such judgment be any the less effective because it appears from the judgment roll that the assessment was illegal and void.” Freem. on Judg., sec. 135, and authorities cited, and note 5; 1 Black on Judg., secs. 170, 247, 261; Murchison v. White, 54 Texas, 78; Boggess v. Howard, 40 Texas, 153.
A judgment by default is no exception to the general rule. Freem., secs. 330, 532.
There are authorities to the effect that where a special tribunal is created or a special jurisdiction is conferred upon a court of record to enforce the collection of taxes, a judgment by default in such proceeding is not conclusive upon the owner of the land. Laws cited in 1 Black on Judg., sec. 247, and Cool, on Tax., 358, 359.
But these decisions have no application to the question in hand, for the reason that the District Court in this State does not exercise a special or limited jurisdiction when it forecloses a lien upon land, but its authority to try “all suits for the enforcement of liens upon land” is derived directly from the Constitution as a part of its general jurisdiction. Const., art. 5, sec. 8.
Doubtless the popular belief, justified by experience, that scarcely any tax sale would confer a valid title to land, conduced to the small price at which the land of the appellees was struck off by the sheriff; but the sale, as we have seen, was judicial, and could scarcely be termed a “ tax sale.”
This brings us to the consideration of the objections made by the appellees to the sale of their homestead upon the alleged grounds of gross inadequacy of price and excessive levy by the sheriff. The part of the lot owned by the appellees (and which was ordered to be and was sold) is 80 feet wide and 60 feet long, and was worth over- $1000 when sold under the judgment. Their improvements occupied only 16 feet front, and on each side thereof there was a strip of the land 32 feet in width, which was shown to have been worth several hundred dollars. It is claimed that the sheriff should have levied upon one of those “strips,” which would have been greatly more than sufficient to have satisfied the judgment and costs, instead of selling the entire property. We are compelled to hold, however, that this claim is without any legal foundation. Both the judgment and the writ of venditioni exponas commanded the sheriff to seize and sell the entire portion of the lot owned by appellees, and left him no discretion in the matter.
There is no doubt that the price for which the land was sold is grossly inadequate; but that alone, without fault upon the part of the purchaser, will not vitiate the sale; nor would an excessive levy, if shown, coupled with such inadequacy of price, be sufficient to avoid the sale, unless it should further appear, as does not in this case, that such levy conduced to the insufficiency of the price. Vide Jones v. Pratt, 77 Texas, 210; Pearson v. Flanagan, 52 Texas, 266; Cook v. De la Garza, 13 Texas, 431; Atcheson v. Hutchison, 51 Texas, 223; Scott v. Solomon, 59 Texas, 593; Haskins v. Wallet, 63 Texas, 213.
We have not in the examination of this case confined ourselves to the points made by the appellees, but have diligently searched the record to discover some legal ground upon which we could affirm the judgment of the District Court, but in vain. We reversé it with great reluctance, on account of the apparent hardship that will thus be inflicted upon the appellees. They are shown to be two “ old and infirm negroes” (husband and wife), who have occupied this land for a number of years as their only home and place of abode; and now it seems, from the record, that their homestead is to be taken from them for a paltry sum, and on account of petty street improvements. They may have been foolish — perhaps obstinate or ill advised; but these things, if true, which does not appear, do not lessen the asperity of the case. It is to be hoped that the almost cruel consequences of these proceedings will serve to some extent as a salutary warning, and that the next time the people utter their will upon the homestead exemption the cities of the State can then no longer levy “locals assessments” upon the homes of the people, but shall be required to provide for the improvement of “ streets, alleys, and sidewalks ” by ad valorem taxation, at least so far as homesteads are to be affected.
A sense of duty and the inexorable mandates of the law compel us to recommend that the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded.
Adopted March 22, 1892.
UPON MOTION TO REFORM JUDGMENT.
HENRY, Associate Justice.
Upon report of the Commissioners of Appeals the judgment in this cause was reversed at the last Galveston Term of this court, and the cause itself was remanded for a new trial.
Before the adjournment of that term a motion was filed by the appellant to reform the judgment, and instead of reversing and remanding to reverse and render judgment for the appellant.
We have re-examined the record with the view of determining whether our disposition of the cause was correct, and we have concluded that it was not.
The cost of constructing the sidewalk adjacent to the lot owned by the appellees was $20.
Without questioning, for the purposes of this appeal, the correctness of anything that was said by Judge Harr in the opinion adopted by us,, in regard to the regularity of the proceedings of the city in the construction of the improvement, so as to make the cost of it justly a debt against the lot and its owners, and in holding that its being a homestead did not prevent the lien from attaching to the lot, we are of the opinion that some other considerations of importance have been overlooked.
Article 475 of the Revised Statutes provides how the estimate of the cost of such improvements shall be made, and declares that the amount imposed shall be ‘ ‘ levied and assessed as taxes and shall be a lien upon the property until the payment of the same.”
In the case of Allen v. Galveston, 51 Texas, 318. this court said: ‘ ‘ These grants of power to make local assessments are strictly construed and must be strictly followed.”
Cooley says, in his work on Taxation, that where a right to bring suit to collect a tax is expressly given, ‘ ‘the statute must be closely followed, and any conditions which are named must be observed.” Page 435.
Article 474 of the Revised Statutes, by virtue of which the tax now in question was imposed, directs that it shall be collected “in equal annual payments, not less than five in number.” This would have required the appellees in this case to pay four dollars each year for five years.
Article 476 provides for a notice to be given of the time when the tax will become due; and if it is not paid, it provides as follows for the enforcement of the lien on the land: “Said officer or committee shall levy on so much of any property on said list, on which said tax has not been paid, as will be sufficient to pay the same, and the same notice of sale as is required in sales for other tax shall be given; and if said tax be not paid before the day of sale, said officer or committee shall sell said property in the name, and under the circumstances, and to the extent, and subject to the same conditions which are or may be provided by ordinance for the sale of real estate in the city charged with the payment of taxes imposed by said corporation; and said officer or committee shall execute a deed to the purchaser at any such sale, and all the provisions of this title in reference to a deed drawn by the assessor and collector shall apply to the deed provided for in this article.”
One of the important rights here secured to the owners of the property by reference to other tax sales is, 1 ‘ that when real estate is offered for sale, the smallest portion of ground (to be taken from the east side of the premises) shall be sold, for which any person will take the same and pay the taxes, and costs, and fees.” Rev. Stats., art. 446.
The authority to bring a suit or the collection of the tax is conferred by article 477, Revised Statutes, reading as follows:
“ In addition to the power and authority granted to the city council to collect said assessment of taxes as aforesaid, they shall have the further power and additional remedy of instituting suit in the corporate name, in any court having jurisdiction of the recovery, against any owner of property, for the amount due for any such work so made as aforesaid; and the city council shall provide, by resolution or ordinance, under the provisions of this title, for carrying out and executing the powers in this chapter conferred; and may adopt such resolutions, and enact such ordinances, and make such regulations as they may deem necessary. ”
It is not necessary for us to say that the last clause quoted was not intended to confer upon the council power to pass ordinances in conflict with, or to enlarge or limit, the provisions of the statute.
It confers the power upon the city council to enact ordinances in harmony with the statutes, and,'in strict subordination to them, to provide ways and means for applying and enforcing them.
The article (477) authorizing a personal suit and judgment is explicit and unambiguous. It only authorizes such a suit ‘ ‘ for the recovery against the owner of property for the amount due.”
It is a personal suit that is provided for, and a moneyed judgment only is mentioned. It does not authorize a suit against the property. It does not authorize a personal judgment against the owner of the property, together with a foreclosure of the lien upon the property.
A lien upon the property is given by the statute, but the manner of its enforcement is carefully and fully provided for.
The right to also bring a suit is not left to inference; neither as to whether one may be brought at all, nor as to what it shall include, if brought. It may be brought “ against the owner for the amount due,” “in any court having jurisdiction.”
We think it must be presumed, that when the Legislature expressly provided for the two modes of procedure, each one complete within itself— one providing exclusively for a remedy against the property, and the other exclusively for a personal remedy — the intent of the law was fully expressed, and that it should be interpreted and enforced as written.
The record shows on its face that the suit was brought by the city against the property to enforce the lien, and not against the owners of the property to recover a personal judgment, and that the judgment was rendered in the same way.
The District Court has a general jurisdiction to render a judgment to enforce a lien on land, without regard to the amount of the debt or the value of the land.
The tax of $20 was in this case a lien on the land, because the law made it so; and if the Legislature had given a suit for the enforcement of the lien, as well as the recovery of the debt, the jurisdiction of the District Court would have existed by the terms of the Constitution. But not when the Legislature has provided another remedy for the enforcement of the lien and has failed or refused to give a suit for that purpose.
If the record in the case in which the judgment was rendered foreclosing the lien had failed to disclose that the cause of action was one over which the court had nó jurisdiction — if it had been silent in that respect — we would be required in this case (where it is brought collaterally in issue) to presume that it was rendered upon a state of facts giving jurisdiction, and it would then, as is said in Judge Harr’s opinion, preclude all further inquiry.
In the case of Withers v. Patterson, 27 Texas, 496, Justice Bell clearly expresses the rule and its limitations as follows:
“If the court orders a sale of land when the circumstances do not exist which under the law authorize it do so, it acts in doing so without jurisdiction, or, in other words, without authority. These are plain propositions. The difficulties which are presented to courts arise in cases where there is a deficiency of proof as to the circumstances under which the court acted in ordering the sale.
“The question in such cases is, how far is proof (which is wanting) to be supplied by presumption ? In the absence of proof there undoubtedly always arises a presumption that a court of general jurisdiction has acted, in doing a thing which it has power under certain circumstances to do, within the limits of its authority. The presumption is that the court has done what it was right to do, and not that it has done a wrong. The circumstances which would have authorized the court to act as it did act are presumed to have existed. But presumptions are indulged in the absence of proof, and not against proof.”
As the record in the suit brought by the city of Jefferson to enforce the tax lien discloses on its face the want of jurisdiction in the court, the judgment rendered was void, and it must be treated as a nullity whenever it is brought in question, whether it be in a direct or a collateral proceeding.
The distinctions between the proceeding to enforce the lien against the property and the suit for the debt are so apparent, and their different effects upon the rights of the property owner generally, and especially in the instance now under consideration, are so important as not to admit of the conclusion that the Legislature intended that they should be intermingled, instead of each being pursued as an independent or distinct remedy.
The sum adjudged against the property was $20. The costs of court and for making the sale amounted to $14.05.
The judgment was rendered on the 24th day of November, 1890.
The sheriff sold the entire lot on the 7th day of April, 1891.
After the judgment, and before the sale, the property owners paid to the attorney of the city on the tax the sum of $6.
The property brought at the sheriff’s sale $35.
The lot measured 60 by 80 feet. The evidence of the market value of the lot ranged from $800 to $1600. It had on it the residence of the owners, on each side of which there were strips of land each about 30 feet wide, each one of which, the owner testified, was worth $600, and that he had been offered that price for one of them.
The result of the suit, if allowed to have effect, would be to compel the owner to pay the entire tax, with costs, in less than one year, and to have his whole property sacrificed in a body at a sale to collect a tax; whereas, if the property had been proceeded against under protection of the statute, it could only have been for $4, if nothing had been paid; and even if sold for the whole debt, it seems reasonable to conclude that less than the whole lot might have been found sufficient.
When the result of disregarding a compliance with the specific terms of the remedies given by the statute may lead to such important differences, we do not think that the courts can treat the distinctions made by the Legislature as immaterial, nor permit the two remedies to be intermingled.
It appears that the city council had passed an ordinance on the subject, of this tax, which, among other things, provided as follows:
“ The cost of the construction of said sidewalk shall be a lien in favor of the city for the amount thereof on the property of such owner, and said lien shall exist in favor of the city for such costs, and shall be by the city enforced in any court having jurisdiction of the subject matter of a suit brought for the purpose, and said property sold according to law to pay the cost of such construction, besides the costs of suit.”
The language of this ordinance clearly embraces the jurisdiction that was attempted to be exercised by the District Court, and if the city council had been invested with the power to annul or amend an act of the Legislature, it would support the judgment in this case. But, as we have said, the city council had no authority to enact an ordinance inconsistent with the statute.
The motion will be granted, insomuch as it seeks to set aside the judgment heretofore rendered by this court, and the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.
Delivered June 24, 1892."
219263,Walter Gresham v. Island City Savings Bank,1893-01-19,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Van Sickle and Corbin were stockholders in the Island City Savings Bank at the time of its suspension of business in January, 1885. After the failure of the bank a proposition was made to a meeting of its stockholders by S. Heidenheimer and others, which was, in substance, that if the owners of all of the stock of the bank would transfer and deliver to the signers of the communication all of the shares, and if the creditors of the bank would consent to accept 74 peícent of the amounts due them in full settlement, such signers would provide the sum of $100,000 for the purpose of carrying on the business of the bank, under a new organization and by the issuance of new stock, under the charter of the bank, and would settle the debts on the proposed basis. It was also proposed, that ten days be allowed in which the stockholders and depositors might subscribe for the $100,000 of new stock, and that the proposers would take such balance as might be left untaken at the expiration of that time. By resolution this proposition was accepted by the unanimous vote of the meeting, at which more than three-fourths of the stockholders were present, and the directors were authorized to do all that was necessary to carry into effect the proposed arrangement. The resolution recited that the stockholders should surrender their certificates for such disposition as Heidenlieimer and his associates might see proper to make, and directed that such stockholders deliver their certificates transferred in blank to the Island City Savings Bank, that they might thereafter be disposed of to carry out the object in view.
Thereafter, on February 21, 1885, the board of directors by resolution authorized the president and cashier of the bank to transfer and deliver to Heidenkeimer and his associates all the property of the bank, in consideration of their undertaking to settle with the creditors.
The property was in fact delivered to the subscribers of the proposition and they discharged the debts, raising $22,000 as a donation to aid in so doing, the assets lacking that amount to pay 74 per cent of the liabilities. All of the old stockholders, except Corbin, Van Sickle, and one other, surrendered their stock as contemplated by the proceedings. One thousand shares of $100 each of what is called the new stock were issued, some of which were taken by old stockholders and the remainder by others. The holders of this new stock assumed control of the bank, treating it as the only stock of the corporation entitled to recognition.
On March 10, 1885, the directors of the bank, by resolution, undertook to make an assessment of 8100 on each share of the original stock, and declared that unless payment thereof was made in thirty days by the owner of said stock, it should be thereafter forfeited, and new stock was authorized to be issued and sold in lieu thereof. Notice was given to Corbin and Van Sickle of this action. Neither of them was present at any of the meetings, and never in any way consented to or ratified the action of the other stockholders and board of directors. They had paid in full for their stock, and advanced no additional sum and took none of the new shares. The charter of the organization authorized its capital stock to be increased to $200,000.
Before the proceedings above recited there were 1141 shares of $100 each, all of which had been fully paid for. Corbin and Van Sickle, in 1889, transferred their certificates to appellant. He made demand of the defendant company for the transfer to be made upon the books and for recognition as a shareholder. This was refused, and he brought this suit to compel the bank to execute such transfers and to reinstate him as a stockholder; and in case that could not be done, to recover damages for the conversion of his stock. The defendant answered, and all of the holders of new stock intervened, setting up the proceedings above stated in bar of the action.
The court below instructed the jury to find for appellant the highest market value of thirty-two shares of stock between the time of conversion and the trial, and to deduct therefrom 8100 per share, with interest from 1885, in order to put him on an equal footing with the intervenors. The jury found for appellant 8448.
We think it clear that the actions taken by the stockholders and directors of the bank did not have the effect to cancel the stock held by Corbin and Van Sickle. Without their consent their shares could not be thus forfeited. 1 Mora, on Priv. Corp., 208.
Having paid the par value of the stock, it was not subject to further assessment for any purpose. Id., 131.
The existence of the corporation, with the powers conferred by its charter, continued, notwithstanding the insolvency of the bank and its consequent suspension of business, and the legal rights of individual shareholders could not be taken from them by the majority, however large, and the attempt of such a majority was beyond the power of the corporation. Bank v. Sachtleben, 67 Texas, 425.
The shares upon which this suit is based, therefore, continued in full force, notwithstanding the declaration that they were worthless and would be considered cancelled.
By the arrangement, however, between the promotors of the new organization, if such it may be called, and those shareholders who assented to the proposition made to them and surrendered and transferred their stock, the former acquired all the rights which such stock represented; and in order to arrive at the right of appellant it is necessary to take the old stock thus transferred into consideration. For it can hardly be contended that by such transfer and surrender Corbin and Van Sickle acquired any additional interest in the concern. It seems equally true that they are not entitled to be placed upon an equal footing with the holders of new stock; for these acquired all the rights of the other old stockholders ""and contributed 8100,000 to the capital stock with which the business was resumed. Thus the new shares when issued represented both the rights of the old stockholders who transferred their shares, and those acquired through the new subscription. Counsel for appellant, in their brief, treat the issuance of the new certificates as being, in legal effect, an increase of the capital stock under the power given in the charter; and for the purpose of ascertaining the relative rights of appellant and other stockholders, this seems to us the true light in which to regard it. But if we should hold that appellant’s shares are equal to the others, this would give to the transaction the effect of a reduction of stock; for there would then be only 1036 shares of $100 each, whereas there were formerly 1141 shares of the same denomination.
It is evident that the purpose of the negotiation was that Heidenheimer .and those acting under him should secure all the rights of the old stockholders, and also an interest equal to their subscription of $100,000. They did acquire the interest of all holders of stock who assented. The new stock was then issued to represent all of the rights which thus arose.
This was binding on the holders of the old stock who gave their assent, creditors were all satisfied, and the rights of Corbin and Van Sickle were therefore as 32 to 2141.
It is true, if 1000 shares in addition to 1141 had been actually issued, this would exceed the maximum limit fixed by the charter for the capital stock. This was not really done. By the consent of all persons concerned, but the three nonassenting members, the stock was fixed at $100,000, represented by 1000 shares. It is necessary to ascertain the proportionate interest which appellant’s stock continued to represent as against the holders of the new stock, and this is arrived at in the way indicated.
The questions remain, Is the appellant still in an attitude to maintain his right as a stockholder, and if so, what relief should be granted to him ? Appellee contends that appellant’s assignors should be held to have acquiesced, by their delay to sue, in the action by the stockholders and directors. They did nothing affirmatively showing an intent to do so. The acceptance by Corbin of the money paid him as a creditor of the bank can not be held to have such effect. The nature of the demand made upon them was such as to call for positive action, rather than mere silence, to signify assent to the transaction. Their failure to transfer and surrender their stock prevents any inference of acquiescence from their silence. As to their failure to sue, the statute of limitations prescribes the time which would constitute a bar. The well settled principles of equity, by which a party may be precluded by loches from attacking unauthorized acts of a corporation of which he is a member, do not apply to the facts of this case. Because of such delay, however, if for no other reason, we think the aid of equity to reinstate him in the enjoyment of the • privileges of a stockholder should be withheld. The managers of the bank have been allowed to go on and establish its organization in accord.anee with the arrangements made in 1885; the business of the bank is doubtless readjusted to the conditions arising out of them. The consequences of forcing appellant into the corporation as a shareholder upon the basis of his right, as we find it to be, may not be easily foreseen. He can be compensated in money for any damages which he has sustained, and we think, under the circumstances, that should be his remedy. The measure of damages should be the value of the stock, treating it as 32 shares in 2141, at the time of its conversion, with legal interest thereon to the date of trial.
A majority of the court hold, that under the facts of this case, such conversion took place at the date of demand by appellant for recognition- as a stockholder and the issuance of certificates to him, and the refusal of defendant to accord to him such right. The value at that time should be ascertained and form the basis of recovery at another trial. Cook on Stock and Stockh., sec. 581, and notes.
Plaintiff’s exceptions to the plea of intervention should have been sustained, in the absence of allegations showing that the defense would not be properly conducted by the defendant. The stockholders are not ordinarily proper parties in such a case.
From what we have said, it follows that the court should have sustained plaintiff’s exceptions to the third and fourth subdivisions of defendant’s answer, in which the resolutions of the board of directors attempting to assess and cancel the stock were relied on as a bar to the action. The defendant, however, adopted the plea of interveners, and the proceedings of the stockholders’ meeting therein set up, showing the proposition of Heidenheimer and others, and its acceptance, while constituting no bar to the suit, are proper to be considered in determining the rights thereby acquired, as we have defined them, as are all other facts affecting that question.
Upon the written transfers of the stock appellant was entitled to maintain the action. He acquired only such rights as his assignors had, and he can not be considered an innocent purchaser. Evidence therefore as to the agreement with his assignors, under which he acquired the certificates, under present issues, would be immaterial.
While we have not followed in their order and in detail the points raised in the briefs, what has been said disposes of all 'questions necessary to a decision. ■ The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded, in order that inquiry may be made as to the value-of the stock at the date of conversion as above indicated. That seems to be the only issue that needs to be submitted to the jury.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered January 19, 1893."
216264,"J. M. Mathis et al. v. F. R. Pridham, Receiver",1892-10-27,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
This suit was commenced October 16, 1882, by appellee as receiver of the Texas Continental Meat Company, a Texas corporation, in the District Court of Victoria County, against certain stockholders of said company, some of whom were alleged in said petition to have been original subscribers to the capital Stock of said company before its organization, or before its charter was filed, as shown by the following agreement, to-wit:
“Victoria, Texas, October 17, 1882.
“We, the undersigned, agree with Captain A. F. Higgs and with each other to subscribe for and hereby subscribe the amounts set opposite our respective names to the capital stock of the Texas Continental Meat Company, a corporation to be chartered under the laws of Texas, with headquarters at Victoria. The said company is to be stocked at $500,000, and we are to receive $2 of said stock for every dollar of cash subscribed. The amount of the capital stock not subscribed for or otherwise disposed of to remain in the company as reserve. It is further agreed, that should our whole subscription not be required, we will take stock in proportion to our subscriptions.”
The charter, it is alleged, was filed on the 20tli day of October, 1882. That at a meeting of the stockholders held soon after the filing of said charter the board of directors of said company was authorized to issue for cash subscriptions shares of full paid stock of the company at the rate of $2 in stock for $1 in cash, such issue not to exceed $120,000, and said directors were to contract with Captain A. F. Higgs for the issuance to him of one-fourth of the capital stock as disposed of in the way of a bonus, and for certain rights, and to retain in the treasury of the company as a reserve the balance, to be disposed of as the growth and necessities of the'company require. That by reason of the issuance of said stock two for one to each of said subscribers, each of them became liable to pay to said corporation the par value of said stock so agreed to be issued by said company to them and each of them, with interest.
The petition then shows, that after the organization of said Texas Continental Meat Company, and its actual commencement and transaction of business at Victoria, the said company made and entered into the following contract for the extension of its business at the city of Fort Worth, in Tarrant County, Texas, and for other and further subscriptions to its capital stock, which contract is in writing, executed and delivered for the consideration therein stated by the persons whose names are signed thereto, to-wit:
“ Fort Worth, Texas, August 4, 1883.
“We, the undersigned, agree to subscribe and hereby do subscribe the sums of money set opposite our respective signatures to the capital stock of the Texas Continental Meat Company, a corporation created by and existing under the laws of Texas, and having its domicile in Victoria, Texas. And we offer said subscriptions to said company under the following stipulations and conditions, to-wit:
“1. That said company shall erect and operate as soon as possible, in or in the immediate vicinity of Fort Worth, a slaughter house, capable of killing, storing, and shipping not less than 250 grown cattle per diem.
“2. Should one-half the sum necessary to erect, equip, and operate said house be less than the amount of our subscriptions, only such a portion of our subscriptions shall be called for as will be equal to said half; provided further, that our subscriptions, or any portion thereof, shall be Subject to call at any time until April 1,1884, and that any portion thereof not then called in by said company shall by said company and by us be considered null and void.
“3. That for our said subscriptions we shall receive certificates of stock in said company in the following proportion, to-wit, for $60 cash we shall receive $85 in stock; provided, that we shall not be entitled to any issue of stock until we have responded to each call to the amount of our respective subscriptions, and that if we shall fail to pay any installments all previous payments shall be forfeited; provided, however, that when our certificates of stock are issued our rights, duties, obligations, and privileges shall relate back to the time of the acceptance of this offer.
“4. That immediately after the acceptance hereof by the company, the charter shall be so amended as to provide for thirteen directors, of whom six shall be immediately elected from the undersigned; but this agreement shall not operate so as to guarantee the election of parties who shall cease to own any stock, or dispose of so much as to be only nominally stockholders; that this shall have the full force and effect of a contract whenever accepted by said company, and the collections of said subscriptions may be enforced as any other debt or obligation.”
And the persons who subscribed said instrument, some forty in number, were also made parties defendant, and with reference to the liability of whom the following allegations were made: “ That the instrument aforesaid was delivered by said subscribers to said company at Victoria on the 25tli day of August, 1883, and was then and there submitted to a meeting of the stockholders of said company, then and there assembled, for action thereon. That said stockholders’ meeting, then and there acting in behalf of said company, did adopt the following resolution of acceptance of said proposition, to-wit:
“ Resolved,, That the proposition made to this company by J. P. Smith, II. C. Edrington, and others, of Fort Worth, Texas, under date of August 14, 1883, be and is hereby accepted, reference being had to the communication of August 25, 1883, from A. F. Higgs, Esq., and that the directors of this company be and are hereby empowered to do all things necessary to comply with the undertaking required of this company by said proposition. That the secretary of the company be directed to spread a copy of said proposition on the books of this company, and to officially transmit as the acceptance of said proposition a copy thereof, a copy of this resolution, and of said communication from A. F. Higgs, together with copies of any other proceedings of this body and of the directory as may be pertinent to the contract consummated by the acceptance of this proposition, to Fort Worth, for the examination and information of the signers of said proposition, notifying each subscriber of the acceptance of the proposition and where such copies can be seen and examined.”
Plaintiff’s petition alleges, that in pursuance of said contract the said Fort Worth subscribers elected their six directors, who, with an assistant secretary and treasurer, took immediate charge and management of the business of said corporation at Fort Worth, under the general direction of the whole board of directors, and that said corporation erected the slaughter house named in the contract, and proceeded to operate the same and continued to transact business at Fort Worth for sometime; and that by reason thereof, and by the execution and delivery of said contract and its acceptance as aforesaid, they and each of the subscribers to said contract became bound to pay to said company the full amount of the stock they contracted to be issued to them, to-wit, for each 860 of cash subscribed $85, the amount of stock they were by the contract to receive. That so far as said subscription in cash was paid by said subscribers, the Stock for $85 for every $60 paid was issued to them and each of them in proportion to his payment; that they had, each and all of them, contracted for $85 of stock for each $60 paid by them and each of them, and that by reason of said contract they were bound to pay, if necessary to secure the solvency of said company, the whole par value of the stock contracted to be issued to them and each of them. Plaintiff further alleges, that none of the subscribers have paid any more than the proportion of $60 for each $85 issued or to be issued to them. It was alleged that some of them had not paid the full amount they agreed to pay.
The petition then proceeds to set out the amount for which each of said Fort Worth defendants is liable.
The petition further alleges, that other defendants sued therein did not sign either of the contracts of subscription to the stock of said company, but bought stock at a discount and became liable and bound themselves to pay the par value of the stock issued or to be issued to each of them, the balance due thereon against each of said subscribers being stated as above.
The plaintiff then proceeds to show, that he was appointed receiver of all the property of said corporation by the District Court of Victoria County on the 16th day of April, 1884, at the suit of Ayres & Cannon et ah, creditors of that company; that he had duly qualified; and that he brings this suit by virtue of an order of said District Court, as follows:
“ In this cause the motions of Fagan & Osgood, the Sterne Fertilizer and Chemical Manufacturing Company, the New Orleans National Bank, creditors pf the Continental Meat Company, defendant in this cause, coming on to be heard by the court, and it appearing to the court from the report of the receiver and from the record in this cause that all the property of said defendant, the Texas Continental Meat Company, has been sold under the order of this court, and that the proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the debts of said defendant company as the same have been proved in this case and have been approved by the orders of this court, and that there is still a large indebtedness of said defendant company unpaid, and that said unpaid indebtedness will be lost to the creditors of said defendant company unless the stockholders of said company be compelled to pay any balance or balances which may be due from each and all of said stockholders upon subscription of stock made by them or any of them or upon the stock of said company which has been issued to them or each of them.
“Now, therefore, the motion of said creditors is granted, and F. R. Pridham, receiver in this ease, hereby ordered, directed, and empowered to institute proceedings at law or in equity to enforce the payment of any balance of stock which is unpaid upon subscription of stock made by them or either of them or upon certificates of stock issued by said defendant company to any one or all of said stockholders, for the use and benefit of said creditors moving herein, and of all other creditors of said defendant company whose claims have been approved by this court; and that any sum or sums recovered in such legal or equitable proceedings be reported to this court in order that it may be distributed under the direction of this court among said creditors. In case any of the stock of said company has been transferred or assigned and such assignment accepted by any person or persons, it is ordered that such person or persons be included in this order and sued as stockholders. This order is made without prejudice to any legal or equitable defense which any one or the whole of said stockholders may have or make against such proceedings as may be taken against them or either of them.”
Plaintiff further alleges, that in the suit 1928 he had been appointed auditor to audit the claims of creditors against said company, and that he had audited and approved claims, which were afterwards approved and allowed by the court on May 30, 1885; and the order appointing him auditor, his report as such, specifying claims allowed, and the order of the court approving and allowing them, with a list thereof, were all attached as exhibits to the petition. The claims they established aggregated $85,394.01, and that other claims amounting to $5315 were after-wards allowed by the court as valid debts against said company, which were also specified in exhibit. The whole indebtedness of said company, as allowed and approved by the court, aggregated $90,682.78; that the receiver had paid to the creditors aforesaid the sum of $10,483.92, and that there now remains due and unpaid the sum of $80,198.86, with interest, and that there is no property or assets of said company to meet said debts, but that said company is totally and hopelessly insolvent.
Plaintiff then prays for judgment of such amount against each defendant as may be sufficient to pay off the indebtedness due by said company.
The petition alleged residence of some of the defendants to be in Victoria County and of others to be in various other counties of the State.
All defendants except those residing in Victoria County excepted to the petition because it showed that they were improperly sued in that county, and showed no right of Pridham to sue in his own name as receiver. They also duly pleaded their residence in other counties and their privilege to be sued there.
General demurrers and special exceptions were taken to the petition on the following grounds:
1. Misjoinder of parties defendant, because of lack of privity or joint obligation, between the different defendants.
2. Misjoinder of distinct causes of action.
3. Because recovery was sought for excess of face value of stock over the amounts paid therefor, when such excess in the issue of stock was void.
4. Because the receiver sets up a cause of action upon which the corporation could not recover, and does not show that he is entitled to represent the rights of creditors, or set up any liability of such defendants to such creditors.
5. Because the petition fails to state facts showing liability of the company to the creditors named.
6. Because the allegations as to the allowance of claims in the receivership proceeding are not sufficient to show the establishment of the debts.
7. Because the petition fails to state the facts out of which each debt grew, with the names of the creditors and dates of accrual.
8. Because the amended petition (the same above stated) sets up a different cause of action from that originally alleged, and because the right thus asserted is barred by limitation.
The defendants sued on the Fort Worth contract further excepted specially to the petition, on the grounds that the contract made their liability to depend on conditions not alleged to have been performed, viz. :
1. The erection and operation of a slaughter house at Fort Worth.
2. That if one-half of the cost of erecting, equipping, and operating the slaughter house should be less than the amount subscribed, only such portion of that amount should be called for as would equal one-half of such cost.
3. The right Of subscribers to forfeit amounts paid and refuse to take stock.
4. That the charter was to be amended so as to provide for thirteen directors, etc.
5. That the capital stock was to be $500,000 paid up, and no allegation that all had been paid or subscribed for.
The original petition was not so full as the amended petition in regard to the claims of creditors.
It charged that by their subscriptions the defendants became liable to the corporation for the par value of the stock. It did allege, however, that plaintiff sued as receiver appointed in the suit of Ayres & Cannon, by virtue of the order of the District Court of Victoria County, set up the amount of debts established against the corporation, and the insolvency of the corporation, and with these differences we infer that it was the same as the amended petition. It is not in the record, but there is an agreement partially stating its contents.
Several of the defendants sued as signers of the first contract pleaded in setoff debts which they alleged the corporation owed them for money advanced to it by them while operating its business.
The Fort Worth defendants pleaded general denial, and special pleas as follows:
1. That their signatures to the contract sued on were procured by false representations made by the corporation through its officers as to its indebtedness and business prosperity.
2. That neither Pridham, as receiver, nor the corporation was the owner of the claim sued on, and that neither has any right or title to or interest in the claim sued on, but that it had been adjudged to Ayres & Cannon.
3. That the charter of said meat company provided for a capital stock of $500,000, divided into 5000 shares, be fully paid up; that there never has been but 3000 shares of said stock subscribed for, and that the subscription books of said company have long since been closed, and that therefore the said subscription is not binding upon them.
4. That prior to the 14th day of August, 1883, the company had organized under its charter and had commenced business, and that the instrument signed by the defendants is not an original subscription of stock, but the stock referred to therein was of the residue of stock belonging to said company which had not been subscribed for or disposed of prior to said 14th day of August, 1883; and that the directors and stockholders did thus determine and agree and dispose of the same as provided in said contract; and that at the time of signing of said instruments by defendants, the stock of said company was not worth in the market more than $60 for $85 face value, and intrinsically was not worth anything; that said contract was entered into on the part of the defendants in good faith and for the benefit of the company, and that they had paid to said company an amount of money set opposite their names in contract.
5. Limitation of two and four years.
6. That by the terms of the contract sued on it was agreed that one-half the cost of building and equipping refrigerating works at Fort Worth should be paid by the meat company, and that defendants who signed the contract of August 14, 1883, should pay the other half and no more; and that it was further provided in said contract, that if one-half of the sum necessary to locate, equip, and operate said houses be less than the whole of said subscription, as shown in said contract, only such portion of said subscription should be called for as would be equal to said half; that said equipments and building in full only cost the sum of $60,000, and by reason thereof these defendants would not be liable in any event for more than one-half of said subscription, and that they have paid more than the legal amount due from them to said company.
7. That at the time they signed said contract as aforesaid, and in order to induce them to do so, the said company represented to them that it was amply able to and would furnish one-half of the money necessary to purchase, locate, and equip the houses at Fort Worth, and that the signers of said contract would only have to furnish the other one-half; that said statement was false and untrue, and was made to deceive the said defendants, and by reason of said statement and others hereinbefore pleaded that defendants were induced to sign their names to said contract, and that they would not have done so except for the fact that they believed in and relied on said statements as true, and did not know that they were false and untrue.
8. That the creditors named in the petition, so far as their claims accrued before defendants signed said contract, did not contract with said company or extend credit to it on the faith or credit of the defendants’ subscription to said contract; and all the creditors whose claims accrued after the defendants signed said contract had full knowledge of the terms and conditions upon and by which defendants were to obtain stock in said company, and consented and acquiesced therein at and before the time such credit was extended to said company and at and before the creation of said debts.
9. That defendants after making payments as alleged elected to forfeit the amount so paid by them on the said subscription or contract of purchase, and to forfeit their right to demand and receive any of said stock of said company, and never did demand or receive from said company any of said shares of stock, and are therefore.not liable any further on said contract or otherwise.
The plaintiff demurred generally to all the pleas in abatement, and filed the following special exceptions, all of which were sustained by the court:
1. To the plea setting up fraud on the part of the company and its officers in procuring subscription to said paper sued on, because fraud between the corporation and stockholders themselves can not affect the creditors of said corporation.
2. To the plea setting up illegality of the alleged issue of stock, because the defendants participated in the alleged illegal act and became members of the corporation, and are therefore estopped from denying their liability to creditors.
3. To the plea that the charter of said meat company fixed the capital stock at $500,000 fully paid, and that the full amount was never subscribed, because said stockholders were bound to the said creditors for any subscription by them made, whether the whole stock authorized by the charter of said corporation was subscribed or not.
4. To the plea of defendants setting up payment in full for the stock as subscribed for in said contract, because each defendant is bound to creditors to pay the par value of the stock contracted for.
5. To the plea setting up that the stock issued to them in excess of the amount paid to them was illegal, because acceptance of said stock binds the defendants to pay the par value thereof to creditors.
7. To the plea setting up offset and counter-claim made by the Victoria defendants on ground that it could not be allowable against creditors.
8. To the plea of limitation of two and four years respectively pleaded by defendants, because in an, action of this character the statute of limitations, as pleaded, can not avail the defendants as a defense to plaintiff’s action.
9. To the plea setting up that the company agreed to pay one-half of the cost of building and equipping refrigerator works at Fort Worth, because said plea offers no defense to the action for the use of creditors.
10. To the plea setting up that the defendants were induced by false representations made by the officers and agents of the company to sign the contract, because the same can in no way affect plaintiff’s rights to recover herein.
11. To the plea alleging right to forfeit the amount paid on the subscription contract, and that defendants did not demand or receive shares from the company, because defendants, as their pleadings show, were in a position to demand the rights and benefits of shareholders.
The court overruled all exceptions to the petition except those based on the failure of plaintiff to allege the facts showing the liability of the corporation for the debts set up in the petition. The plaintiff was required to amend so as to show the name of each creditor, the amount due him, the date at which it accrued, and the date of its approval by the court; and this having been done, all exceptions to the petition were overruled. All the exceptions above stated to defendants’ pleadings were sustained. There is no question arising upon the pleadings of defendants except those so set out, and it is unnecessary to state such pleadings.
The cause was tried before the judge without a jury. In the progress of the trial the plaintiff introduced G. A. Levi, who testified that he had been secretary of the meat company at Victoria and that H. C. Edrington was the secretary at Fort Worth; that he as such secretary received from Edrington a certificate or statement showing names of Fort Worth subscribers, amount subscribed, amount paid, number of certificate, number of shares and value; that this was sent for his use in issuing the stock; that Edrington wired him not to issue the stock, but send blank certificates to him (Edrington) and let him issue them. Plaintiff then offered the statement in evidence, for what purpose is not shown. It was signed “H. C. Edrington, Loc. Sec. and Treas.” Defendants objected to it, because its execution was not proved; it was hearsajq ex parte, and secondary. The execution of the paper having been shown, the court admitted it in evidence, and defendants excepted.
Among the creditors for whose benefit the suit is brought are the New Orleans National Bank, the State National Bank of New Orleans, C. M. Soria, Adoue & Lobit, Fagan & Osgood, Osgood & Gray, Texas Continental Transportation Company, and Ayres & Cannon.
The defendants attempted to show notice to each of these creditors of the agreement between the corporation and the stockholders for the taking of stock by the latter at less than par. The court below found that none of them had notice.
A. Baldwin was president and William Palfrey cashier of the New Orleans National Bank, and I. H. Kennedy president of the State National Bank.
It was shown that in the efforts of the promoters of the meat company to sell stock to Baldwin and Kennedy individually, each of them was informed of the fact in question a month or two before the credit was extended by their banks to the company. It is not made to appear how those debts were created, or that either Baldwin or Kennedy acted for the banks in creating the debts. It was also shown that a director of Baldwin’s bank was present when Baldwin received the information. Palfrey was also shown to have been informed of the nature of the subscriptions for less -than par value of stock, but whether before or after the debt to his bank originated does not appear.
It was shown that Soria knew all about the terms upon which stock was issued before his claim against the company accrued, but how long before it is not shown; nor does it appear that his receiving knowledge had any connection with the extension of credit to the company, or was in such relation to it that he might be presumed to have remembered it when the debt was created.
Adoue, of the firm of Adoue & Lobit, received information that stock had been sold at a discount before that firm credited the corporation. Their debt accrued in January, 1884, and the only date given when, Adoue received notice was in June, 1883, in an effort to sell to him, as an individual, stock in the compan)'.
There was evidence vaguely tending to show notice to Fagan & Osgood, and Osgood of the firm of Osgood & Gray, but there is a conflict of evidence, and we conclude they had no notice.
The Texas Continental Transportation Company was organized at the same time as the meat company, and the two companies were intended to and did work together. A. F. Higgs was president of the latter company and vice president of the former. D. M. Higgs, his brother, was president of the former company, and both knew all about the disposition made of the stock, and we conclude that the fair inference is that the transportation company had notice.
It was shown that Ayres and Cannon both knew of the facts in question at the time they extended credit to the company.
The court below found that none of these creditors had notice.
The first conclusion of law of the court below was that the Fort Worth contract was executory, and that upon payment of the shares contracted for or any part of them the signer making it became a stockholder, whether certificates were issued or not; and that signers who failed to pay within the time fixed in the instrument were never stockholders, and not liable for the debts of the corporation.
The second conclusion was that every stockholder who received shares at less than par value is liable for the difference between such value and the price paid, unless creditors had such knowledge as would charge them with express or implied assent to such sale. But for any debt created prior to such sale the subscriber was not liable.
The third conclusion held that all the stockholders were properly joined in the suit.
The fourth conclusion was that limitation had not run against creditors, and that the claims were conclusively established in the case of Ayres & Cannon against the company.
, The fifth conclusion held that article 585, Revised Statutes, did not affect creditors with notice of sales below par of capital stock, and that the claims were conclusively established in the case of Ayres & Cannon against the meat company.
The fifth conclusion holds that the notice to Kennedy and Baldwin did not amount to notice to the banks of which they were respectively president, and was not admissible against the banks.
I. The first question for our consideration is whether the suit as brought could be maintained against all the defendants jointly in Victoria County.
Viewing it as an original proceeding, the claim of jurisdiction in that court over the persons of the defendants who resided in other counties must be justified, if at all, under some provision of our statutes regulating the venue of suits. Undoubtedly the venue of all suits, whether legal or equitable in their character, is fixed by those provisions.
The fourth subdivision of article 1198, Revised Statutes, in which is defined one of the exceptions to the general rule that defendants must be sued in the county of their residence declared by that article, provides that “ where there are two or more defendants residing in different counties, suit may be brought in any county where one of the defendants resides.”
Some of the defendants here resided in Victoria County, and the inquiry resolves itself into the question whether or not those defendants who had their domiciles in other counties were necessary parties to the suit as brought; for unless they were they could not, if this be regarded as an independent suit, be sued away from their homes.
Their subscriptions were several undertakings, and the rule which requires that joint obligors be sued jointly has no application. A bare action at law, either by the corporation or a creditor, to enforce the payment of a subscription of any one of them, could be brought only in the county of his residence. This suit, however, is not of that character. In its general structure and purpose it is an equitable proceeding in behalf of all the creditors of an insolvent corporation, after the appropriation of all its tangible assets to the debts, against subscribers to its capital stock, to have an accounting and a contribution from the defendants of such proportion of their unpaid subscriptions as might be found necessary to satisfy the debts. In this character of suit it is essential to the completeness of the remedy that the amount of the indebtedness of the corporation, the amount of unpaid stock in the aggregate, the amount due from each stockholder, and the proportion thereof necessary to discharge the debts, should be definitely and finally ascertained.
It might also become necessary that the court ascertain who among the subscribers are solvent and who insolvent, in order that the solvent ones be required, as far as their subscriptions suffice, to contribute enough to make up the deficiencies arising from insolvency of the others.
It is apparent, therefore, that in order to render certain and uniform justice to each creditor and each stockholder, they should all as far as practicable be brought into court. Accordingly we find the rule that equitable suits of this character must be brought by or for the benefit of all the creditors, and against all delinquent subscribers to the stock of the corporation who are solvent and within the jurisdiction of the court, so well established by authority that we need only to refer to some of them. Cook on Stock and Stockh., sec. 206, and note; 2 Mora. on Corp., sec. 897; Beach on Priv. Corp., sec. 700, and authorities cited.
These authorities commend themselves to our judgment as being sound and as indicating the true doctrine on the subject.
It certainly should be within the power of creditors of an insolvent corporation or their representatives pursuing the trust fund, which the law declares unpaid subscriptions to capital stock to be, to bring all the parties necessary to a full adjustment of their rights before the same court in one suit, and secure an adjudication which will settle all their rights and liabilities. The principles and practice of equity afford such a remedy, which in nowise conflicts with our statutes regulating venue, but is embraced within the scope of the fourth exception to article 1198. Authorities which maintain the right of a creditor to sue an individual stockholder to recover an unpaid subscription and apply it upon his debt do not conflict with the rule above laid down. In such suits an accounting and marshalling of assets and distribution of all the proceeds is not sought, but a single creditor seeks satisfaction for his debt out of the unpaid subscription of one stockholder. Some authorities deny his right to do so, and hold that the remedy in equity is exclusive. Others admit the right of the creditor to maintain such an action, but none of them in America, so far as we have examined, deny the right of all the creditors to join all delinquent members of the corporation in one proceeding such as that now before us. Some of them hold that the joining of all the stockholders from whom subscriptions are due is not essential; but others, and we think the better ones, hold that in so comprehensive a proceeding as a suit for an accounting and a determination of the pro rata part of the indebtedness which each subscriber shall pay, all must be joined, as far as known, unless they are insolvent or beyond the jurisdiction.
The appellee contends, with much reason, that the power to bring before it delinquent subscribers to the stock of the corporation was involved in the jurisdiction acquired by the District Court of Victoria County over the corporation and its assets by the original suit for the appointment of a receiver and the administration of all the assets of the corporation for the benefit of its creditors.
In view of the fact that the corporation was composed of its stockholders, and that they were, if they owed subscriptions, holders of assets which constituted in equity a trust fund for the payment of debts, and that some of them resided in Victoria County, we think the suit was properly brought there.
From this it results that the court did not err in overruling appellant’s exception to the petition, nor in sustaining those of appellee to the answers asserting the privilege of defendants to be sued at their residence. It also follows that the exceptions to the petition on the ground of misjoinder of parties and causes of action were properly overruled.
II. The next contention in the assignments and briefs is, that the receiver had no right to sue in his own name. The statute in force at the time of his appointment and when this suit was brought expressly authorized receivers to sue (Revised Statutes, article 1468), and he showed in his petition that he had been ordered to sue by the court. It is true that neither statute nor order in terms directed the suit in his own name. But the suit was one which the corporation by the agreements sued on was estopped from bringing, and it is difficult to see any reason why its name should be used when the cause of action asserted never accrued to it. We. understand both the order and the statute to authorize suits in the name of the receiver. Some authorities hold that unless a receiver is expressly authorized to sue in his own name, he can not, though authorized to prosecute a cause of action belonging to the party whose assets he holds, use his own name as plaintiff, but must use that of him to whom the right originally belonged. Others hold differently, and we think they are sustained by the stronger reason. High on Rec., 209, et seq. The law now in force expressly authorizes suits by a receiver in his own name. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 1464,
III. The point is made by exceptions to the petition that the stock alleged to have been issued to defendants in excess of the price to be paid was void under article 12, section 6, of the Constitution, which provides, “ No corporation shall issue stock or bonds except for money paid, labor done, or property actually received, and all fictitious increase of stock or indebtedness shall be void,” and that therefore no liability on their part could grow out of it.
The first clause of this provision prohibits the issuance of stock unless it has been paid for; the second renders void “all fictitious increase of stock or indebtedness.”
The petition does not allege any fictitious increase of stock, but that the original stock was sold at less than par to the defendants, in violation of the rights of creditors. Stock issued and disposed of for a valid consideration is not fictitious within the provision quoted. The language is not that all stock sold for less than its face value shall be void, but .that “ all fictitious increase of stock shall be void.” In case of Stein v. Howard, 65 California, 617, an increase and sale by a corporation of its stock below par was held not to be fictitious under a constitution having the same provision. Peoria & Springfield Railway v. Thompson, 103 Illinois, 187, is another case which construes a constitutional provision very similar to our own.
We see nothing in the provision in question which changes the rule long established by courts of equity that stockholders of a corporation are liable to the creditors for the par value of the capital stock subscribed for or held by them.
IV. Several exceptions to the petition raise the question that it does not sufficiently show that the plaintiff is seeking to enforce the rights of creditors rather than those of the corporation against the defendants.
The allegations of the petition plainly show that the suit is for the benefit of the creditors and asserts a cause of action which the company could not.
We think also that the petition, as finally amended, was sufficiently specific in its allegations as to creditors. It was not necessaiy under the facts alleged to set out the cause of the action of the creditor against the corporation, as would be required in an original suit by the creditor, to establish it. The claims had all been established by the court in the receivership proceedings, and an allegation of that fact conclusively showed the liability of the corporation for them. This is an answer also to the claim of appellants that the claims of the creditors against the corporation were barred by limitation.
V. Tfie original petition set up the same cause of action as that shown in the amended petition. In both the rights of creditors were asserted. The averments in the original petition were meager and defective, yet enough was stated to show the nature of the right asserted and that it was in behalf of creditors.
VI. The special exceptions of the Fort Worth defendants, that the petition showed no performance of the conditions of the subscription contract, by alleging that the slaughter house had been erected and operated, the charter amended, and capital stock all paid or subscribed, were not well taken; nor was the exception, that the petition did not exclude the hypothesis that the defendants had elected to forfeit the amounts paid on stock and recede from the agreement to take stock, as they claimed the right to do under the contract.
The petition did allege that the house was erected, equipped, and operated. The fact that the company was compelled by financial embarrassment to suspend the business certainly could not release stockholders from their obligations to creditors. They did not stipulate for a successful operation of the business for all time.
It was not necessary to amend the charter in order to increase the number of directors. Rev. Stats., art. 575. That was done, and the objects of that provision in the contract attained.
There was no stipulation in their contract that all of the capital stock provided for in the charter should be paid up or subscribed before liability should attach to them. They were bound for the stock they subscribed for, whether all of the remainder was ever taken or not.
The contract gave to the subscribers no right of election to forfeit their payments and recede from the agreement or refuse to pay for the whole of the stock which they bound themselves to take.
VII. The exception to the petition, that it did not allege the cost of building and equipping the slaughter house at Fort Worth, should have been sustained, because the amount of the liability of the Fort Worth subscribers depended on that fact. They did not, as we construe the contract, unconditionally agree to pay the amounts subscribed to the paper for stock at the price specified, but that they would pay those sums only in case half the cost of building, etc., should be equal to the amount subscribed. If one-half of such cost should be less than the amount subscribed, then they agreed to pay only such part of the latter amount as would be equal to half the cost.
It may be' admitted that by their contract they became liable to creditors of the corporation for the full face value of such stock as they thereby subscribed for, and still the question would remain, what amount of stock did they agree to take ? They had the right to attach conditions to their subscriptions (Cook on Stock and Stockholders, 83), and this was clearly one by which the amount of money they were to pay and the amount of stock they were to receive was to be or might be limited.
In setting out the contract and in failing to negative the hypothesis that half the cost of the building was less than the amount signed for, the petition left it uncertain what amount plaintiff was entitled to recover. It is true that there are general allegations that by the contract the defendants became liable for such amounts, but these were conclusions and not good against special exceptions.
Vm. From what has been said concerning the overruling of exceptions to the petition, it will follow that there was no error in sustaining plaintiff’s exceptions to pleas of defendants presenting the same points as were involved in the exceptions.
IX. The exceptions of plaintiff to the answers of some of the Victoria defendants, pleading, in setoff debts due to them from the company, were correctly sustained. Cook on Stock and Stockli., secs. 193, 227d.
The eases referred to by appellants were suits by a creditor against an individual stockholder and not a suit in equity against all', and the distinction between the two proceedings is recognized in those cases. Mathez v. Neidig, 72 N. Y., 100; Garrison v. Howe, 17 N. Y., 458; Agate v. Sands, 73 N. Y., 620.
X. There was no error in sustaining exceptions to the pleas setting up that the subscriptions of the Fort Worth defendants were obtained by fraudulent representations. Enough facts were not stated to make that a good defense against the corporation itself.
But admitting that the facts, if timely set up, would have availed against the company, they could not be of any avail in this proceeding as a defense against creditors. Cook on Stock and Stockh., secs. 154-210, note 141; Knox v. Ogilvie, 22 How., 380.
XI. The ruling sustaining exceptions to the plea of the Fort Worth defendants, setting up that they bought the stock contracted for by them from the residue of stock left on hand, and paid all they agreed to pay, was not erroneous. By this written contract they plainly agreed to take so much of the capital stock of the corporation as the sum for which they bound themselves would pay for, at a rate below the par value of the shares they were to get. This was an appropriation to them, by agreement between them and the corporation, of portions of the capital stock, the trust fund out of which the creditors had the right to seek satisfaction; and while it conferred upon them the right to the stock, as between them and the company, it also bound them to make good to creditors the amount called for by the stock whenever that might become necessary to pay the debts. The form of the contract between them and the corporation is immaterial. Equity looks at its substance and effect upon the rights of creditors; and thus regarded, it was only a subscription by them to the stock at a price below its par value. This was illegal as against the creditors. whom the -law will not allow to be deprived of the fund which it holds sacred for their satisfaction, by any device or contrivance of the corporation and the subscribers. Cook on Stock and Stockh., sec. 199; 1 Mora. on Corp., sec. 427; 2 Mora, on Corp., sec. 781; Upton v. Tribilcock, 91 U. S., 45; Tayl. on Corp., sec. 124.
It is claimed that article 585, Revised Statutes, which provides that the directors may dispose of the residue of the capital stock at any time remaining unpaid, in such manner as the by-laws may prescribe, authorizes such a transaction as that in question, and relieves the subscribers from the operation of the rule we have just stated.
There is no purpose shown here to authorize the directors to release subscribers to stock from their obligations to creditors.
The directors are authorized to dispose of residue of stock in such manner as the by-laws may direct. It was not alleged that any by-law on the subject had been adopted, and for that reason the plea was defective. But a more direct and positive statutory provision than this must be shown to satisfy us of the legislative intent to authorize subscriptions to the capital stock of a corporation at less than its par value (as was this contract by its very terms) and a release of the subscribers from their liability to creditors. The charter fixed the capital stock, and the law gives it the effect that all of such stock should be paid up, if necessary to pay creditors. We can not see that, by the provisions quoted, the Legislature intended to authorize the by-laws of the corporation to change the effect of the charter, but only to regulate the disposition of the residue of stock in such manner as was consistent therewith. This disposes of the further contention of appellee that this statute put creditors upon such inquiry as would have affected them with notice of subscriptions to or sales of stock at a discount.
, XII. The defendants’ plea of the statute of limitations can not avail them as a defense, and they were properly struck out on exceptions. No cause of action against the subscribers ever accrued to the creditors until they had exhausted their remedy against the corporation and had all of its property applied to their claims. The subscribers could not be called on to pay, and were not subject to suit, until it was established that the amount due from them was necessary to satisfy the indebtedness. The statutes of limitation were not applicable to the case.
XIII. We think the certificate or statement of Edrington was hearsay, and that its admission in evidence was error. In the view we take of the case, however, this would not, alone, necessitate a reversal of the judgment.
Several points are made upon the failure of the court below to find upon certain issues, as requested. In view of the disposition to be made of the case it will not be necessary to notice them further thaii they may be involved in the discussion of other questions.
XIV. This brings us to a consideration of the points raised upon the conclusions of the court below. What we have already said sufficiently indicates our views as to the liability of the subscribers of the two contracts for the difference between the par value of the stock and the amount they agreed to pay for it. They are liable not only for the amount they agreed to pay, but for the full face value of the stock they subscribed for. In the case of the Fort Worth defendants this will depend upon the facts that may be alleged and shown as to the cost of building and equipping the slaughter house at Fort Worth, as explained above.
The Victoria appellants claim that the court erred in fixing the liability of the Fort Worth defendants, in holding that they were to be treated as shareholders only from the time they made payments, and charged with the par value of stock only where they had made payment on their subscriptions.
We think the position of the appellants is well taken. As before seen, the contract signed by the Fort Worth defendants was a subscription for such portion of the capital stock as would be taken by the amounts they agreed to pay at the rate specified.
The error of the court in not sustaining exceptions to the petition as above pointed out would become immaterial as to the Fort Worth defendants by the judgment rendered, but this complaint of the Victoria defendants raises (as they have the right to do) the question as to the full liability under the Fort Worth contract, and that makes it necessary to go fully into that. It is not necessary that shares of stock should have been actually issued and delivered to any of the subscribers. Their subscription fixes their liability, though the issuance and acceptance of shares of stock would also fix liability for the full face value.
XV. We think that the notice given to Baldwin and Kennedy, presidents of the banks, was not sufficient to charge the banks with notice of the arrangement between the corporation and its stockholders, in the absence of evidence that they acted for the banks in extending credit to the corporation at such time and under such circumstances as to authorize the inference that the knowledge formerly acquired in their individual transactions was still present before their minds. As the evidence stood, the court did not err in holding that it was not admissible against the banks. They might be shown to have received notice through their presidents, but this evidence did not go far enough.
It may be said of the information to Adoue and Soria, that it is not so connected with the creation of their claims against the company that they should be held to have known it at that time.
Parties engaged in business can not be required to store away in their memories all the facts which they learn, so as to be able to call them up at any time in the future, to affect other transactions than that in which the knowledge was acquired. Such information has not the characteristics of notice in law, unless the transaction to be affected thereby took place under such circumstances as would lead to the reasonable conclusion that the fact reported was still remembered. Ogden v. Hearn, 24 Ill., 60.
The proof as stated in the record showed, as we conclude, that the Texas ■Continental Transportation Company and Ayres & Cannon had notice, and the court below should have so found; and so with the transportation company.
The evidence on these points may be different on another trial, and we merely indicate our views as to the law applicable to the evidence, as we find it in the record.
Delivered October 27, 1892.
We think the court below was right in holding that creditors having notice at the time their claims arose, of the arrangement between the corporation and the subscribers, could not hold the latter responsible for more than they agreed to pay; and it necessarily resulted from this ruling that those of the Victoria stockholders who were also creditors of the corporation could not demand from the subscribers the difference between what they agreed to pay and the face of the stock. They could not therefore participate in the fund that was to be contributed by stockholders to pay creditors not having such notice.
It appears, however, that some of the subscribers have never paid all they agreed to pay, and a recovery of that is sought in this case. That should when recovered constitute a fund for all of the creditors, whether with or without notice, for as to that creditors without notice have no priority over the others.
We have found it impracticable to follow in our opinion all of the assignments of error in the several briefs of the parties in their order; but we believe it will be found that what is said above disposes of all the questions raised by any of them in this appeal. The assignments of the defendant Kempner raise the same questions as are discussed in connection with the contentions of the Fort Worth defendants. His case does not differ in principle from those of other subscribers. He took stock from the corporation at less than its face value, and must be held liable to creditors for the difference between that and the amount he paid.
Because of the errors pointed out the judgment must be reversed; and inasmuch as the pleadings and evidence are not sufficient to enable us to determine the extent of the liability of the Fort Worth subscribers, it is not in our power to render a judgment here settling all the rights of the parties.
The cause will therefore be remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
Reversed and remanded.
Justice Pleasants did not sit in this case."
219228,Thomas J. Russell and Wife v. W. H. Nall,1892-12-15,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellee sued appellants, in trespass to try title, for the land in controversy. Judgment was rendered in the District Court in appellee’s favor for the land, and cancelling a deed from T= J. Russell to his wife, under which they defended.
Appellee showed title as follows: Judgment in his favor against Russell for $1192.25, dated May, 1890, affirmed by Supreme Court February 24, 1891; abstract thereof duly registered, February 26, 1891; execution March 14, 1891; sale April 7, 1891, of the land in controversy, and purchase thereat by himself, and deed to him by the sheriff.
Mrs. Russell asserted title under a deed from her husband of date February 9, 1891, which was not filed for record until March 9, 1891. Appellants claimed, also, that the land was their homestead at the time of the recording of the abstract, the levy of the execution, and the sale thereunder. Appellee, at the time his abstract was filed, and when the execution was levied, had no notice of the deed from Russell to his wife, but received notice before the sale. He also attacked the deed from Russell to his wife, on the ground that it was made with the intent to hinder, delay, and defraud Russell’s creditors.
The facts in regard to the claim of homestead, as found by the district judge, and shown by the evidence, are as follows: Russell and his first wife, up to 1873, occupied the land as their homestead. They were then divorced, and Russell continued to live on the place until he married his present wife, in December, 1883. She refused to' live there, and neither of them have since done so, though they have gotten some firewood, vegetables, fruits, and the like, from their tenants on the place, which they used for family purposes. The land lies three miles from Beaumont. In 1890 Russell bought lots 15 and 16, in block 4 of the Calder addition to Beaumont, after the same had been cut up into blocks, lots, streets, etc., and a map thereof placed of record. His lots front on Calder Avenue, and he immediately built and occupied, with his wife, his residence on these two lots, and was so living upon and occupying them at the time of this trial in the District Court. He paid for the lots, but there is a lien upon them for balance due for improvements. There were houses north, east, south, and west of him, and lots in the Calder addition were then worth from $250 to $600, the defendant paying $625 for his. A part of this Calder addition runs up to the Crosby Hotel, the chief hotel in the city, though the addition itself lies just outside the corporate limits. The town was incorporated in 1881. The superintendent of the city public schools lives across the street from defendants. Russell is a practicing lawyer and keeps an office in Beaumont. The court found, as a fact, that the Calder addition was a part of the town of Beaumont, and that appellants’ homestead was in the town.
The court below held, that the lien acquired by appellee from the registration of the abstract and levy of the execution, was superior to thé deed to Mrs. Russell, and held that such deed was made in fraud of creditors and that the land was not homestead, and that therefore appellee was entitled to recover.
Many of the assignments of error relate to alleged mistakes made by the trial judge in the statement of facts, and will not be noticed.
There are propositions in appellants' brief, seeking to make the point that evidence, offered by appellee, to meet the claim of title asserted under the deed to Mrs. Russell, was not admissible under the pleadings. There was no objection to the evidence when offered in the court below, no motion for new trial, nor exceptions to the findings of the judge, nor was the point in any way called to the attention of the trial court. It is too late to present it for the first time in this court, and it can not be considered.
There was no error in sustaining the plaintiff’s exceptions to defendants’ answer, alleging that the plaintiff had not paid to the sheriff the costs of former suit upon his purchase of the land. The sheriff had made the deed to plaintiff, and whether or not he had paid the costs was an inquiry which could not affect the issues involved in this suit. It was shown at the trial that he did pay the costs and had the balance of his bid credited on the execution.
It was competent for plaintiff to inquire into the consideration of the prior deed from Russell to his wife for another tract of land, for the purpose of showing that thereby the alleged debt which formed the consideration of the deed in question had been paid, wholly or partially, as well as to develop facts pertinent to the question of fraud.
It is too well settled to require citation of authority, that a judgment creditor who acquires a lien on land, through registration of an abstract or levy of an execution, acquires a right superior to that of the grantee in a prior unrecorded deed from his debtor, of which such creditor has no notice. It follows, that under the evidence in the case, unless appellants sustained their claim that the land was their homestead, no judgment was proper but that which was rendered. As to such claim, the evidence amply sustains the finding of the court below, that they had abandoned the rural homestead and acquired another in a town or city. They could not hold both, and the land in controversy was therefore subject.
This renders it unnecessary to pass upon the other questions raised in appellants’ brief as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conclusions of the lower court upon other points. Whether such findings were correct or not, the evidence in the particulars we have indicated sustains the judgment, and it is therefore affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered December 15, 1892."
219256,Thomas Benson v. Screwmen's Benevolent Association,1893-01-26,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
This case was formerly before the Supreme Court, and its decision is reported in 76 Texas, 552. It was there held, that a mandamus to compel the defendant to reinstate the plaintiff as one of its members should be denied, because it appeared from the allegations of the petition that plaintiff had a remedy by appeal to the association from the action of its board of trustees expelling him therefrom. It was said in the opinion: ■“ We think it matters not that the order of expulsion may have been contrary to law and void, and such as this court would not hesitate to annul in case there was no appeal within the association. The point is, that it was the action of the tribunal created in accordance with the constitution, and appellee had an adequate remedy by appeal within the society itself.” _ The court concluded that the exception to so much of the petition as sought a mandamus should have been sustained.
Plaintiff, after the cause was remanded to the court below, amended his petition, still seeking a mandamus as well as damages for the wrongful expulsion, but added nothing sufficient to cure the defect which had been held fatal to his prayer for mandamus. A general demurrer and special exceptions to the petition were urged by defendant, the latter on the ground which had been held good by the Supreme Court, and also on the further ground that there was an improper joinder of action for mandamus and for damages. The court sustained the general demurrer and special exceptions, and upon plaintiff declining to amend, dismissed the suit.
Under the former decision we must hold that the exceptions to the petition, so far as it sought a mandamus, were properly sustained. Whether or not additional facts, as to the illegality of the proceedings by which plaintiff was excluded from membership in the defendant, are alleged in the amended petition now before us,- we can not say, as we have not access to the petition on which the former appeal was decided. But none that could be stated would more than show the nullity of those proceedings; and that, as appears from the quotation above, would not meet the objection. It still appears that plaintiff could have appealed to the society from the decision of its board.
It does not follow, however, that the cause should have been dismissed. The former opinion does not hold that plaintiff has no other remedy than an appeal to the association, but that the existence of that remedy precludes a resort to the writcof mandamus, because that is allowed only as a last resort. It does not hold that the decision of the board of trustees, under the facts alleged, is binding until reversed by the society. If the allegations of the petition be true, there can be no doubt that the attempted expulsion was void, and could furnish no defense to the association in depriving plaintiff of his rights as a member.
He could therefore maintain an action for damages sustained, the proceedings resulting in his expulsion being null, and the petition alleges facts sufficient to entitle him to such relief. Ludowski v. Polish Society, 29 Mo. App., 337.
Whether an action for mandamus could properly be joined with one for damages in such cases or not, his petition did not entitle him to the former remedy, and the exception should have been sustained to the part which was bad and overruled as to that which was good.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered January 26, 1893."
219044,Southern Pacific Company v. John Leash,1893-01-26,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
Plaintiff brought this suit against the Southern Pacific Company, to recover damages for personal injuries received by him while in the employ of the company as fireman of a pile-driver engine, without fault or negligence on his part.
Defendant demurred to the petition, and also pleaded a general denial and contributory negligence. The demurrer was overruled, and trial by jury resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff. The overruling of the demurrer has been assigned as error.
Substantially stated, as far as necessary, the petition alleges, that at the time of the injury plaintiff was in the employ of defendant as a fireman of a stationary engine on a piledriver car, then and there being operated by defendant in the city of Houston; that said stationary engine was situated near one end of said car, and while plaintiff was engaged in shovelling coal into the said engine, one of the defendant’s employes in charge of one of the locomotive engines then being operated by the defendant, caused said engine and certain cars attached to it to violently jolt and jar said piledriver car, without warning to plaintiff, whereby he was thrown from said car, between the same and another car immediately behind it, and one of his legs was run over by said car and he was injured.
That said stationary engine was located very near the end of the car, it being intended that the same should be enclosed in a small house, for the protection in part of defendant’s employes, including the fireman, whose duty it was to shovel coal into the furnace of said engine; that some two or three weeks before said accident happened, said engine had been removed temporarily from said car, in order that the same might be more conveniently used in the removal of a wreck, and in order to take the engine off from said car the rear end of the house enclosing the engine, being the portion next to the end of the car, had been taken out, it having been constructed in such a manner as to be easily taken out and replaced by means of bolts, without injury to the structure of the same:; that previous to said accident, plaintiff had been in the employ of defendant as a fireman in connection with said stationary engine on said piledriver car, for a year or more, and that on a number of occasions during said period said engine had been taken off temporarily from said car and placed on the ground, such removal having been made by taking out the rear end of the house as aforesaid; that on all said occasions when the engine had been returned to said car, the plank forming the rear end of said house, in connection with the narrow sliding doors, also forming a part of the same, had been replaced; that about four days before the occurrence of the accident complained of, the engine was returned to its place on the car, but defendant negligently failed and neglected to replace the end of said house, and negligently permitted said piledriver car to be used without the same being replaced.
Said house having no end to it, and there being no projection whatsoever on the sides of the same to which a person could catch hold in case of a jar or jolt, plaintiff was thereby exposed to great and unnecessary danger in passing around said engine and in shovelling coal into the same; that when said jolt and jar occurred, as before alleged, plaintiff did in fact throw his hands against the side of said house, and had there been a projection there, even to the extent of a few inches, which he could have caught hold of, or had the plank constituting the end of said house been replaced as promptly as it had been the custom of defendant theretofore to do, the accident would not have occurred. Plaintiff also averred that defendant had promised to replace said plank forming the end of said house within a very short time, and by its action induced plaintiff to believe that the same would be replaced within a very short time; and that relying on such promise, and on the custom and habit of defendant to replace the end of said house as aforesaid as soon as the engine was returned to the same, plaintiff continued to remain in defendant’s employ, and discharge the duties of a fireman in and about said engine, being induced thus to continue the same by reason of the conduct, words, and actions of the defendant as aforesaid. He also charged that defendant and its employes were guilty of negligence toward him and others whose duties required them to work about said engine, in failing at once to restore the end of said house to its proper place; and that the accident to him complained of resulted from such negligence on their part, and without fault or negligence on the part of plaintiff.
As stated in the brief of counsel for the appellee, the suit was brought upon the theory that the master had promised to repair the defect caused by leaving out the end of the house, and the injury having occurred within a reasonable time for the performance of such promise, and the defect not being of such a dangerous character that a prudent man would not have continued in the service, in view of the promise, for such reasonable time, the defendant company assumed the risk of the defect, thereby making itself liable to the plaintiff for the consequences of the accident.
Without committing ourselves to the position thus broadly taken by counsel for the appellee, we think the facts alleged in the petition bring the case within the exception to the general rule, that the employe can not recover for injuries received from the use of defective implements or machinery of which he had notice, as recognized in Railway v. Drew, 59 Texas, 12. Plaintiff alleged that the accident would not have occurred but for the fact that the end of the house had not been replaced, and that defendant had promised to replace it within a very short time, and by its action induced plaintiff to believe that it would be replaced as promised; and that relying on the promises of defendant, and the custom and habit of defendant to replace the end, plaintiff continued to remain in its employ and the discharge of his duties. It also appeared from the petition that the engine had been returned to the car only about four days.
It would appear from the petition that the defendant was negligent in failing to replace the end of the house that had been removed. The effect of the allegation with respect to the promise of the defendant to replace it within a short time would be to relieve plaintiff from negligence contributing to the injury by remaining in the service when the defect was obvious and the danger apparent, and he was entitled to have it go to the jury with other evidence for the purpose of determining whether or not, under the facts, he was guilty of contributory negligence. In Hough v. Railway, 100 United States, 224, the court said: “If under all the circumstances, and in view of the promises to remedy the defect, the fengineer was not wanting in due care in continuing to use the engine, then the company will not be excused for the omission to supply proper machinery upon the ground of contributory negligence.” So it would seem that proof of a promise to replace the end of the engine house would be admissible as evidence to show that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care, and that, the question should be submitted to a jury. Railway v. Brentford, 79 Texas, 625; Railway v. Williams, 82 Texas, 342.
• It can not be said that the jolt or jar was an intervening or independent cause contributing to the injury, and that the defendant would not be liable because it was the negligence of the fellow servant of the plaintiff, for it was against such contingencies that the end of the house would be-reasonably inferred to be a protection.
Appellant’s eighth assignment of error is as follows: “That the court erred in overruling the defendant’s motion for new trial, the verdict of the jury being contrary to and against the charge of the court; the verdict of the jury being contrary to law. The verdict of the jury was found contrary to and against the evidence, the testimony showing that the danger was open, manifest, and well known to plaintiff, who was an intelligent man of much experience in that particular work. That it was only necessary to work at the fire on the piledriver car when it was at work, and the construction train was not moving. That the train was moving at the time of the accident, and it was gross negligence for the-plaintiff to be at work at the time on the piledriver car. That no promise was made to plaintiff of such character as would relieve him from the risk caused by removing and not replacing the end of the piledriver car.”
We think that it conclusively appeared from the evidence that whatever defect or danger there was in the operation of the piledriver and the-engine with the end out, was equally as open and obvious to the plaintiff as it was to the defendant. The evidence showed that the piledriver and the engine by which it was operated were placed upon a flat car; the pile-driver being at one end and the engine at the other end of the car. Around the engine was erected a house large enough to enclose the engine, which had an upright boiler; three sides were fixed fast to the car, but the side or end of the house next to the end of the car was composed of four pieces of planks bolted in position, so that they might be unbolted and the end taken out for the purpose of removing the engine from the car when it became convenient to do so. When in position, the end of the house was so arranged that the middle planks slided to each side and formed a door or opening through which one might pass into the house and around the engine. Just next to this end of the piledriver car was a box car used as a tender for coal, tools, etc. It was the duty of plaintiff as fireman of the engine to shovel coal from the box car into the furnace of the engine. The house came within five inches of the end of the flat car on which it was situated, and in shovelling in coal plaintiff would stand sometimes with one foot on this part of the car and the other in the box car; but when the. end of the house was in position it was shown that he could stand in the door so as to brace himself and keep from falling, and that in case of a jolt or jar he would have something to catch hold of. When the end of the house was not in place there was no way to brace himself, nor was there anything to catch hold of, if he should be about to fall from the jolting of the cars.
It was perfectly obvious that an attempt to shovel coal into the engine while the train was in motion, with the end of the house out, would be attended with danger. When the accident occurred the piledriver car had been taken into Houston for dinner, and the conductor of the train and the other employes were setting timber in position so as to go to work; the train was switching at the time. Plaintiff testified, that at the time he was shovelling the coal into the engine the train was not in motion, and that the jolt occurred just as he had finished and thrown the shovel into the box car; but all of the other eye-witnesses state that the train was in motion. Whether the train was in motion or not, there was no danger or defect about the condition of the engine house that the plaintiff was not fully aware of, and unless he is protected in remaining in the employ of the defendant by a promise, express or implied, to remedy the defect by replacing the end of the house, he can not recover. And it is doubtful if our Supreme Court would recognize the exception at all, unless the employe, having continued in this employment on the strength of the promise, should be ignorant at the time of the accident of the fact that the employer had failed to comply with his promises.
But we do not think there was shown by the evidence any promise, either express or implied, or anything arising out of notice to the defendant’s foreman, such as would have induced the plaintiff to remain in the service.
The want of authority in the foreman to make the promise does not .seem to be raised by the assignment of error, but it was sufficiently shown that he was in charge of the force operating the piledriver, with authority to hire and discharge, which must mean of course to hire and discharge the men under him.
It was shown that sometime prior to June 3, the ends of the house had been taken out and the engine taken off the car for use elsewhere; that it was replaced on June 3, but the planks forming the ends of the house were not put in position again. Plaintiff did not work on that day, nor did he go to work until Wednesday noon, and the accident occurred on Friday, June 7.
Plaintiff was questioned with reference to the promise, and answered as follows:
Q. What did you say or do about the ends of the house ? .
A. I told him Wednesday, “ How about this back part of the house ?” He said he would like to get through. This was about 6 o’clock Wednesday. He was just getting up on the box car, smoking a cigar. I called his attention to it, as it was there to protect me. He said he would like to get through. I told him again the next day, Thursday, at noon. He was standing in the car then, and I said, “Are you going to have this fixed up ?’ ’ and he said he would like to get through there. That was on Thursday, the 6th, right at noon.
Q. Did he say he would put it up when he got through ?
A. Yes, sir. (Defendant objected to question as leading.)
Q. What did he state about putting it up P
A. He said he would like to get through. The next day was Friday, -and I thought they would put it up on Sunday, so they would not lose two or three hours during working days. They put it up before on Sunday, the 17th of March. Told them about that house about three years ago. When they were taking it down I asked them about it, and they said they would put it back right away.
In explaining how he got hurt, and after describing the injury, he said: “ They took me into the car and I said, ‘ You see what you have done ? Why didn’t they put up the back part of the house as I asked them to do ?’ While I was lying there bleeding I said to them, ‘ Why didn’t you put up the end as I asked you ? ’ ”
Q. Who was that ?
A. A foreman, Freeland. He said, “ Do you suppose we were going to accommodate you ? ” That was while I was lying on my bunk bleeding.
Q. Did you run this risk, you say, as you thought they were going to put this up on Sunday ?
A. They had always put it up on Sunday; they said they were going to fix it up.
He further stated that they always put the end in on Sunday before. The only promise that can be at all inferred from this evidence is, that the foreman said that he would put the end in when he got through with the work that they were then at; and it nowhere appears that the plaintiff ever relied on this indefinite promise, for he says he thought they would put it up on Sunday, as they were in the habit of putting it up then; and it is clear that the plaintiff was not induced to remain in the service by any promise, either express or implied, to replace the end of the house. This was all the evidence as to a promise; the foreman denied having had any such conversation with plaintiff.
It is unnecessary to notice the remaining assignments of error. They relate to the giving and refusing of charges. The charge of the court, taken as a whole, with the instructions given at the request of the defendant, was a fair presentation of the case.
Because the verdict of the jury was contrary to the evidence in the respect pointed out, the judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered January 26, 1893."
219204,International & Great Northern Railway Company v. Thomas Greenwood,1893-01-26,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
This is a suit by appellee against appellant for damages in the sum of $5700 actual and $10,000 exemplary damages. The petition alleges:
That defendant employs many thousand men in different capacities as laborers and servants, nearly all of whom do occasionally visit the city of Houston upon business or pleasure; that many thousands of the people who inhabit the many towns and cities along defendant’s said lines of railway visit the city of Houston, and have been accustomed so to do for more than one year last past; that by reason of its immense business connections and its great army of employes, the defendant possesses great power and influence for good or evil.
That plaintiff, since the 1st day of June, 1888, has been and is now the proprietor of the boarding house and saloon attached thereto on the corner of Congress and Caroline Streets, in the city of Houston, in- Harris County, Texas, called the Commercial Hotel.
That on or about the 1st day of June, 1888, the said defendant company did unlawfully, wickedly, maliciously, and oppressively institute and inaugurate a “boycott” against plaintiff, and did use its immense power and influence to drive away his custom and patrons and destroy his business.
That on or about the 1st day of November, 1888, one McElyea, a division road master on the Gulf division of defendant’s road, whose business in the line of his duty is and was to employ more than 1000 men, and work and control them in keeping a great many miles of said defendant’s road in repair, did assume to act for and by authority of defendant, and did vigorously and maliciously prosecute said boycott so instituted and created by defendant against plaintiff as aforesaid, and did publicly declare it to be his intention to discharge and refuse employment to any and all men who should in any way patronize plaintiff, either by eating at his house or drinking at his bar.
That said McElyea did discharge, in November and December, 1888,. a number of men because of their friendship to and patronage of plaintiff; that said conduct of McElyea did alienate many of the friends of plaintiff, whereby plaintiff lost much trade.
That said McElyea did, about the 1st day of November, 1888, in Harris County, Texas, and at many other times and places, both before and after said day and date, instruct his section foremen of said division of defendant’s road to discharge and refuse employment to any one known to patronize and deal with plaintiff.
That in November and December, 1888, employment was and still is scarce and difficult to obtain for common laborers; that influenced by the aforesaid conduct and threats of said McElyea, many of plaintiff’s patrons left him, and many others were deterred and prevented from patronizing him.
That the defendant did know and was fully informed of, about, and concerning the conduct of its servants and officials in their boycott of and injury to plaintiff on and from the 1st day of June, 1888, or by due diligence might have known; that defendant was fully informed of said conduct of it servants about the 1st day of November, 1888.
That defendant was specially informed by plaintiff, about January 4, 1889, of the said boycott and conduct of its servants, and especially of McElyea and his conduct, and of plaintiff’s injury therefrom, and relief demanded. But the defendant wholly refused plaintiff any redress, and fully ratified, confirmed, and made its own all the aforesaid acts and conduct of all its said servants, and more especially the wicked, malicious, and cruelly oppressive conduct of said McElyea.
That the aforesaid conduct of defendant has driven away custom and trade from plaintiff, and injured his business to the amount and value of $100 per month from June 1, 1888, to and until the present time.
That by reason of the aforesaid boycott by defendant against plaintiff, and by reason of the conduct and manner of defendant and its servants in the prosecution and continuance thereof, the plaintiff has been constantly annoyed, vexed, harassed, pained, wounded, and injured in his mind and feelings, to his great damage and injury, to-wit, in the sum of $5000.
That by the wicked, cruel, malicious, and oppressive conduct of defendant toward plaintiff as aforesaid, plaintiff has been injured in the further sum of $10,000 exemplary damages.
The defendant answered by general demurrer and general denial. The former was overruled, and a trial by jury followed, in which the plaintiff recovered a verdict for $100 actual and $300 exemplary damages.
The first assignment of error brings in question the correctness of the overruling of the general demurrer by the court below. Appellant contends that the petition fails to state a cause of action; because, first, no conspiracy was alleged; second, under the facts alleged, appellant had the right “ to prohibit its employes or servants from attending any place of resort, such as a saloon and boarding house combined, under penalty of being discharged,” and therefore did no wrong to appellee in issuing the order; third, the business alleged to have been injured was not averred to have been lawful; and fourth, there was no allegation that prior to the alleged wrongful acts of appellant appellee enjoyed the custom for the loss of which recovery is sought, and that he lost it through such wrongful act.
1. The first point seems to be, that the term “ boycott” imports a conspiracy, and that the use of that term rendered it necessary for the pleader to show that a conspiracy existed. Whether or not this word has acquired, in modern usage, a meaning sufficiently definite for a court to take notice of when used in pleading, without explanation, is a question not very material to this case. (See a discussion of the point in cases referred to in 2 American and English Encyclopedia of Law, 512.) The term, so far as its import is developed, does not seem very applicable to the transaction alleged in the petition. But the legal characteristics of the cause of action are to be determined from the act alleged, and not from the name by which the pleader calls it. If that act is in law such as to give rise to a cause of action, the naming of it does not alter its character. The objection to the petition, that it does not allege a conspiracy, is not well taken, if the act charged against appellant was a legal wrong to appellee, for which he may maintain an action. The act might be committed as well by one as by many.
It is held in the case of Delz v. Norman, 80 Texas, 403, that a mere conspiracy is not actionable unless the act done thereby would be actionable if done by one singly. Whether this is true as broadly as it is stated or not (Bishop on Noncontract Law, section 357, et seq.), it can not be doubted that an injury to one’s trade which will subject the guilty party to liability for damages resulting therefrom may be inflicted without a conspiracy. This brings us to the second objection.
2. Did appellant have the right to prohibit its servants from patronizing appellee’s hotel and saloon ? If in issuing the order or threat it only exercised a legal right, it may be admitted that appellee can not complain, though it resulted in loss to him, whatever may have been the motive with which the act was done. If appellant would have had the right to discharge its servants for doing the forbidden things, then it must follow that it could lawfully notify them that it would exercise it. -
It had the same right to discharge its servants as all masters have under similar conditions. This right was not to dismiss the servants arbitrarily or capriciously, but for reasonable causes only. Were the acts, the doing of which appellant declared to its servants should be the cause of their discharge, such as would justify the action which was threatened ?
The allegation is, that the employes were threatened with discharge if they “in any way patronized plaintiff, either by eating at his house or drinking at his bar.” We think it too plain, that, as thus stated, there would have been no just ground for discharging the servants for doing what they were thus forbidden to do. This is charged to have been done maliciously, with intent to injure plaintiff.
The employes, presumably, had the right to eat and drink where they chose, so long as they violated no contract with their employer and performed their service well, and the malicious use of such moral coercion upon them by the appellant as this petition alleges, for the purpose of injuring appellee, was wrongful, and made appellant liable for such damages as was thereby inflicted.
Appellant did not have the right to intentionally induce others to abstain from patronizing appellee, except for a legitimate purpose. Delz v. Norman, supra. According to the allegations, it did, by threats of unlawful discharge, cause its servants to withdraw their patronage, with intent to injure appellee.
This was not the exercise of a legal right, as contended, and the second proposition of appellant can not be sustained.
What we have said applies only to the rights of the master with reference to servants already in his employ. It is proper to say in regard to the alleged notice, that appellant would not take into its service any who might patronize appellee, that appellant had the right to determine for itself whom it would thereafter employ, and the reasons upon which it might act concerned no one but itself. Bish. Noncon. Law, sec. 144; Heywood v. Tilson, 75 Me., 225.
To what extent a master may exercise his influence with his employes, to promote their welfare, as well as to protect his own interests which are dependent upon their action, is not involved in the decision of this demurrer. The petition excludes the idea that the action complained of was taken for any legitimate purpose.
3. It was not necessary that the petition should allege that the business was lawful. The keeping of a hotel is, per se, a lawful business. The sale of liquor may become so by a compliance with the law regulating it. The law would presume that appellee was conducting his business lawfully. He was not required to anticipate a charge that he was violating the law, and to negative it by affirmative allegations.
4. The fourth proposition is met by the petition, which does show that appellee lost the custom of employes by reason of appellant’s conduct, sufficiently at least to meet a general demurrer. Our conclusion therefore is, that the demurrer was properly overruled.
The ruling of the court in sustaining objection to the question asked by appellant of the witness Beordan, as stated in the third assignment, can not be revised, because the bill of exceptions does not state what the answer would have been. Under a general denial we do not think appellant could interpose the defense that plaintiff’s business was unlawful. If it desired to make such a defense it should have pleaded it.
The appellant requested the following special charge, which was refused: et If you believe from the evidence that the defendant company, or its agents, did instruct ""its employes not to patronize the plaintiff’s hotel and saloon, but did so to prevent troublesome litigation with plaintiff, or interference with their customs or regulations with their employes, but not for the purpose of injury to plaintiff or his business, you will find for the defendant.” We think this was'rightly refused. Appellant might doubtless adopt appropriate measures with its employes, to prevent troublesome litigation with plaintiff, but it could not interfere with his legitimate business in order to do so. How it was nececessary to forbid patronage of that business in order to prevent litigation is not made to appear. It is shown that some of the employes in trading with appellee had transferred to him their papers, by which their right to receive wages from appellant was in some way evidenced, and that harassing suits had been brought by appellee from time to time upon such claims. Had such assignments alone been forbidden, upon penalty of discharge to the employes, a different question would be before us. Such is not the case.
There is no assignment which questions the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict, except the seventh, and that is too general to raise any question concerning the finding of the jury, save the allowance of exemplary damages. We have considered the evidence bearing upon this, point, and conclude as a fact that the act of appellant was not done maliciously, nor with reckless or wanton disregard of appellee’s rights; and that therefore the verdict for exemplary damages is not sustained. There are in the record two bills of exception, complaining of language used by appellee’s counsel in addressing the jury. As to the first, it is shown that the court checked and rebuked the counsel and properly instructed the jury. In the other instance counsel was permitted to state to the jury that the reason appellee had not brought forward more of the employes of appellant who had been discharged for patronizing appellee or had withheld their custom from him, was that they had been discharged by the defendant, and had gone like migratory birds and could not be found by plaintiff. Objections made by appellant’s counsel to this were overruled, the court stating in explanation of the bill of exceptions that there was evidence that the employes “ were ever transient, changing continually.” Such evidence is not found in the statement of facts. There was no evidence that defendant had discharged its employes, nor that plaintiff could not have found them, and the statement ought not to have been allowed. The fact stated was not one calculated to arouse passion or prejudice, and as the verdict is not attacked as not being supported by the evidence as to actual damages, in view of the disposition we will make of the case, it will not be necessary to notice this error further than to condemn it.
If appellee will within ten days file in this court a remitter of the exemplary damages ($300) the judgment will be affirmed, otherwise it will be reversed and remanded.
Delivered January 26, 1893."
219205,Henry Ash v. D. A. Akin,1893-01-26,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
By the service of the garnishments upon appellant in the suits of the creditors of Theo. Ash, the effects held by him under the deed of trust were put in the custody of the law, ■and a lien was fixed upon them in case they were subject to Theo. Ash’s debts in favor of the plaintiffs in those suits. Focke, Wilkens & Lange v. Blum, 82 Texas, 439; Harrell v. Cattle Co., 73 Texas, 614.
It was the duty of the garnishee to hold them, in order to apply them in accordance with the judgment of the court, when it should determine the rights of the parties. Waples on Attach., 290-292. If he has converted them into money, this may make him liable to the garnishing creditors for their value; but it does not, we think, defeat his right, as against appellee, to hold the proceeds with which to meet such liability, if established by the courts in which those suits are pending. Appellee by his garnishment acquired no greater right to the fund held by appellant than Gabriel Ash had. Appellant, it is true, received the money in trust for Gabriel Ash, but the latter had no right to recover it of him so long as there were garnishments in force requiring appellee to hold it. Waples, 197-199.
The court below, therefore, should not have rendered judgment requiring appellant to pay over to appellee a part of the funds thus held, unless the bond of indemnity entitled the latter to it. We know of no authority by which a garnishee may be required to surrender property which he is entitled to hold for his protection, and to accept in its stead the personal undertaking of the creditor and sureties. The authorities cited by appellee do not sustain such a proposition. That Gabriel Ash is not a party to the other suits, and not therefore to be bound by judgments which may be rendered therein, does not affect the question. Appellant is a party, and a judgment may be rendered against him as garnishee in favor of the creditors of Theo. Ash, which will bind him. Gabriel Ash is not a party necessary to a valid judgment in those suits.
The cases cited by appellee are not applicable. Alamo Ice Co. v. Yancey, 66 Texas, 187-189; Arthur v. Batte, 42 Texas, 159.
In the first case, the garnishee in his answer admitted his indebtedness to the judgment debtor, and asked no relief. An intervenor came in, asserting a right to the debt owed by the garnishee. His petition was excluded on exception, and there stood before the court the answer of the garnishee admitting the indebtedness and giving no reason why judgment should not be rendered against him. The court held that no course was open but to render judgment.
In Arthur v. Batte a creditor of Batte had garnished one Hughes in the Federal court. Batte had subsequently recovered judgment against Hughes in a State court on the demand sought to be reached by the garnishment, and was proceeding to collect it by execution. • Arthur, the creditor, sought an injunction to restrain such execution in aid of his garnishment. The court held, that he could not maintain such proceeding, because, among other reasons, it was for Hughes to take proper steps to protect himself against double liability.
Here the appellant sought the protection of the court in which appellee’s garnishment was pending. His plea was very defective, and the exceptions to it should have been sustained. But the court overruled them, holding the answer sufficient; and appellant then showed a state of facts which, under the ruling on the exceptions, should have exempted him from judgment. The court held him liable because a bond was tendered to secure him against loss. Thus by the action of the court he was prevented from doing anything more than he had attempted, and at the same time judgment was rendered against him on a ground which, we have seen, did not authorize it.
When the case goes back the exceptions to the answer should be sustained, and if appellant then seeks to perfect his pleadings, he should be allowed to do so, and an opportunity afforded him to take such other timely steps as will protect him against double recoveries.
The case should not be indefinitely continued until the other cases are disposed of, nor unreasonably delayed, but such proceedings should be had as to reach a definite determination of the rights respecting the fund.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered January 26, 1893."
219140,Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. M. L. Weisman,1893-01-26,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellant can not be held liable for delay which was caused by its connecting lines, in the absence of proof of negligence on its own part. No partnership between it and such other lines, nor any other facts, were shown under which it would be responsible for delay on the part of other carriers. The case of Railway v. Baird, 75 Texas, 256, is conclusive upon this point. Every fact upon which joint liability with connecting lines for their negligence was sought to be fixed upon the last carrier in this case was present in that; and in addition there was in that case an undertaking of the railway carrier to transport the stock over the whole route, while here the bill of lading was only to East St. Louis. We must hold, therefore, that if delay did not result from appellant’s own wrong, it is not liable. On the other hand, if appellant wrongfully refused to receive and forward appellee’s goods on to their destination when they were tendered to it at St. Louis, thus causing the delay, it would be liable.
The uncontradicted evidence shows, that a shipment of goods, including those of appellee, was tendered to appellant by the agents of the Wabash line, over which it had arrived at East St. Louis, and was rejected by appellant because a part of the goods had been damaged. The case containing the goods of appellee was erroneously “ billed” (by which we understand the witnesses to mean the designation of the property upon the way bills), not to appellee, but to another person, to whom also the damaged goods were consigned. The case belonging to appellee was not separately tendered to appellant, but the tender was of all the goods in one lot, including those that were damaged. Appellant had adopted a regulation that it would not receive goods that had been damaged while in the hands of other roads unless it was indemnified against liability for such damage. Upon its refusal, on this ground, to accept the freight, it was returned to the warehouse of the Wabash line, and remained there until the agents of that line were instructed to deliver to appellant the undamaged part of the shipment, and this was the occasion of the delay.
The rule which appellant thus enforced was a reasonable one. When goods are delivered at their destination in a damaged condition, the presumption arises that they received such damages while in the hands of the last carrier, and this regulation was an appropriate and legitimate means by which appellant might protect itself against danger of liability for a wrong which it had not committed.
The record shows, that in the discussion between the agents of the Wabash line and those of appellant, the former expressed the opinion that -the damage to the package was only trifling, but the amount was not assessed, and the indemnity demanded by appellant was refused. The extent of the damage is not otherwise shown. The carrier in whose hands the injury had occurred could not force appellant to receive the goods and take the risk of a suit by the consignor. There being no connection or relation by which appellant was bound by the contract of the carriers through whose hands the goods had passed, the agents of the Wabash, in-seeking to ship over its road, were bound to comply with its reasonable regulations. Appellee’s loss from this delay thus arose through the fault of other lines, for whose acts and omissions appellant is not responsible.. It follows that appellant, when the goods reached Marshall, had the right to hold them until the freight charges were paid, and that appellee can not recover for the detention of the property resulting from his refusal to pay such charges when it was tendered to him.
The judgment will therefore be reversed and rendered for appellant.
Reversed and rendered..
Delivered January 26, 1893."
219065,Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. Mrs. D. H. Bledsoe et al.,1893-01-03,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
Appellant prosecutes this appeal from a judgment rendered against it, and in favor of appellees, on account of personal injuries resulting in the death of D. H. Bledsoe, husband and father of the appellees, respectively. It is apparent from the pleadings and from the record, that the injuries were received while the property of the defendant company was in the hands of John C. Brown and Lionel A. Sheldon, as receivers. Under such circumstances a recovery, it is well settled, can not be adjudged against the receivers. Turner v. Cross and Eddy, 83 Texas, 218; Receivers v. Selph, 83 Texas, 607. Nor could a recovery be adjudged against the company for the negligence of the receivers. Railway v. Collins, 84 Texas, 121.
Appellees seek to maintain the judgment in this case on two grounds, which, as they contend, were not considered by the court in the case of Turner v. Eddy and Cross, above cited. These grounds are as follows:
First. Appellant is liable under subdivision 2 of article 2899, Revised. Statutes, which subdivision reads as follows: “2. When the death of any person is caused by the wrongful act, negligence, unskillfulness, or default of another.”
Second. Appellant is liable under subdivision 1 of article 2899, not indeed as9the ‘1 proprietor, owner, charterer, or hirer ” of a railroad (the sole relation considered in the Turner case), but because the receivers must be regarded as the “servants or agents” of the appellant at the-time the injury was inflicted.
We are unable to sustain either of these propositions. Subdivision 2 is applicable only when the act or omission complained of is chargeable to the direct or immediate agency or negligence of the person sought to be bound. Hendrick v. Walton, 69 Texas, 192. We do not understand it to be here contended that the receivers were personally and immediately guilty of the negligence complained of.
With reference to the first subdivision: Receivers (in the absence, at least, of facts specially affecting and qualifying their relation) are to be regarded not as the agents of the railway company itself, but as the representatives of the court appointing them, for the preservation and management of the property. Brown v. Warner, 78 Texas, 543; Railway v. Geiger, 79 Texas, 13.
These views remain unchanged after a careful perusal of the case of Railway v. Cox, 145 United States, 593, cited by appellees, which involves the construction of the liability of receivers under a statute of Louisiana.
We decline to adopt the suggestion of appellant, to reverse and dismiss this case. We are not prepared to say that a state of facts might not exist, and be made to appear on another trial, requiring the receivers to be considered agents or representatives of the railroad corporation. In any event, we prefer the course usually followed by our Supreme Court, to reverse the judgment and to remand the cause.
It is accordingly so ordered. •
Reversed and remanded.

216220,Bateman and Brother v. The Western Star Milling Company,1892-10-11,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
January 5, 1891, in the District Court of Tarrant County, appellee, as plaintiff, brought this suit against appellants, as defendants, upon certain acceptances in the aggregate sum of $1422.82. From a judgment in behalf of appellee for this amount, rendered June 25, 1891, appellants prosecute this appeal.
There is in the record an agreed statement of the facts proved. The terms of this agreement, with reference to the interstate character of the transaction involved and liereinbelow referred to, are to some extent vague and indefinite. As interpreted by us, however, and by the parties in their briefs, the agreement shows substantially as follows:
That at the date of the acceptances and of the institution of this suit, and of the rendition of the judgment, the plaintiff was a foreign corporation for pecuniary profit, organized under the laws of the State of Kansas, and that at said, dates it was and had been, through its commercial agents and otherwise, soliciting business in the State of Texas, and as such had sold goods to the defendants in this cause and to various other persons and firms in Texas; that it had no general office or special place of business in this State; that at said dates it had failed to file its articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas, for the purpose of procuring a permit under the provisions of the Act of the Legislature of the State of Texas, approved April 3, 1889; that the acceptances sued on were executed in consideration of certain goods and merchandise purchased by the defendants in Fort Worth, Texas, from plaintiff, through its commercial agent or drummer; that in pursuance of said purchase the goods in question were shipped by the appellee in the State of Kansas, thence transported and delivered to the appellants in Fort Worth, Texas.
The Act of the Legislature referred to requires that foreign corporations (save in certain specified cases) desiring “ to transact business in this State, or solicit business in this State, or establish a general or special office in this State,” shall file with the Secretary of State a duly certified copy of their articles of incorporation. It further provides, that on failure to so file such articles of incorporation, 1 ‘ no such corporation can maintain any suit or action, either legal or equitable, in any of the courts of this State, upon any demand,” etc. It further provides, that in order to procure such permit, such corporation shall pay a fee, ranging from $25 to $200, according to the amount of its capital stock.
The contention of appellants is, that the failure of plaintiff to comply with the Act of the Legislature above referred to defeats its right to maintain this suit. The contention of appellee is, that to it, as a foreign corporation engaged in interstate commerce, this statute is inapplicable; or, if sought to be applied, that it is unconstitutional and void — that it is repugnant to the “ commerce clause” of the Federal Constitution.
The principle is well established, that it rests purely within the discretion of a State to recognize or to repudiate a foreign corporation; that it can, if such be its pleasure, exclude such a corporation entirely, or admit it conditionally. This principle, however, is not of universal application. A very emphatic and well fixed instance in which it does not obtain, is where a foreign corporation is engaged in interstate or foreign commerce. Horn Silver Mining Co. v. New York, 148 U. S., 314. That provision of the Federal Constitution which provides that 1 ‘ Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States,” constitutes such regulation a domain of legislation peculiarly within Federal prerogative.
The question then arises: Was the corporation plaintiff in this case engaged in interstate commerce, within the meaning of the Federal Constitution ?
The record, as we understand it, discloses that plaintiff corporation shipped, from its domicile in Kansas, goods and merchandise to Fort Worth, Texas, and there delivered them, or caused them to be delivered, to appellants, for which the indebtedness sued on was contracted. These goods were commodities of barter and sale — the essence of commerce; and the business in which the corporation plaintiff was engaged consisted in transactions of this character. It must be held, therefore, that the sale, transportation, and delivery of merchandise under such circumstances, and in the transaction of such business from one State to another, constituted an interstate commercial transaction within the meaning of the commerce clause in question, which applies as well to commerce carried on by corporations as to that carried on by individuals. Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall., 181; Robbins v. Taxing District, 120 U. S., 489; Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, 111 U. S., 196; see also opinion of Matthews and Blatchford, Justices, in Mfg. Co. v. Ferguson, 113 U. S., 727; Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U. S., 47-62.
We are constrained, therefore, to hold, by virtue of an unavoidable construction of the authorities cited, that the statute invoked, if applied to the corporation plaintiff in this case and to its transactions, would impose conditions and restraints upon interstate commerce; that it would regulate interstate commerce. So understood and so applied, it is in conflict with the constitutional provision referred to, and must be deemed inoperative and void. Singer Mfg. Co. v. Hardee, 16 Pac. Rep., 605; Ware v. Shoe Co., 9 So. Rep., 136.
Delivered October 11, 1892.
The opinions in the cases last cited, from the Supreme Courts of New Mexico and Alabama respectively, are particularly pertinent here. There are doubtless, however, cases in which the statute in question would be effective, and beneficially so; but it must be held not to be applicable in this case.
Appellants addressed to the plaintiff’s petition a special exception, the overruling of which they have assigned as error. We la.y no stress upon this assignment, as in the light of the facts subsequently fully developed, any error committed in reference to the special exception was rendered wholly immaterial.
The judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed."
219109,Reed & Barton v. W. W. Walker,1893-01-03,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
This appeal is prosecuted on an agreed statement under article 1414, Revised Statutes. A copy of the agreement is as follows, viz.:
u 1. On November 12, 1890, plaintiff instituted this action in the County Court of Dallas County, Texas, against the defendant, W. W. Walker, for the value of goods, wares, and merchandise, aggregating $646.88, sold defendant by plaintiff at various times during the year 1890.
“ 2. March 14, 1891, plaintiff filed a first amended original petition, from which it appears, and wherein it is alleged, that at the time of the sale of said goods, wares, and merchandise plaintiff was a corporation, incorporated under the laws of the State of Massachusetts, and as such was engaged in Taunton, in said State, in the wholesale and retail mercantile business; that while so engaged, and in the usual course of its business, it sold in said State to this defendant said goods, wares, and merchandise, without having obtained a permit to do business in Texas.
“3. It was not averred in said amended petition that plaintiff had filed with the Secretary of State its articles of incorporation and received a permit to do business in. this State, or otherwise complied with the provisions of an act of the Twenty-first Legislature of the State of Texas, approved April 3,1889, entitled, 6An act to require foreign corporations to file their articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State, and imposing certain conditions upon such corporations transacting business in this State,’ and to repeal an act approved April 2, 1887, entitled, ‘An act to require foreign corporations to file their articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State, and imposing certain conditions on such corporations transacting business in this State, and providing penalties for the same. ’
“4. Defendant pleaded the following special demurrer to'said first amended original answer, viz.:
“ ‘ That from said petition it appears, that the plaintiff is a foreign corporation, and the said petition does not show that it has ever filed with the Secretary of State its articles of incorporation and received a permit to do business in this State, as required by law; wherefore this defendant says that said incorporation ought not to maintain a suit in the courts of this State.’
“ This demurrer was by the court sustained, and plaintiff declining to amend, the cause was by the court dismissed.
“ 5. The ruling of the court in sustaining the demurrer presents the only issue involved in this appeal; plaintiff contends:
“(1) That the act above referred to had no application to a foreign corporation whose business was transacted outside of the State, and which had never entered the State nor transacted or carried on business within the State.
“(2) That the act is a violation of the Constitution of the United States which gives to Congress the power ‘ to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States and with the Indian tribes.’
‘ ‘ If either of the above propositions should be determined in favor of plaintiff, the cause should be reversed and remanded; otherwise it should be affirmed.”
So much of the act above referred to as bears upon the issues involved is here copied, viz.:
“ Section 1. That hereafter any corporation for pecuniary profit (except as herein after provided), organized or created under the laws of any other State, or of any Territory of the United States, or any municipality of such State or Territory, or of any foreign government, sovereignty, or municipality, desiring to transact business in this State, or solicit business in this State, or establish a general or special office in this State, shall be and the same is hereby required to file with the Secretary of State a duly certified copy of its articles of incorporation, and thereupon the Secretary of State shall issue to such corporation a permit to transact business in this State. If such corporation is created for more than one purpose the permit may be limited to one or more purposes.
“ Sec. 3. That hereafter no such corporation can maintain any suit or action, .either legal or equitable, in any of the courts of this State upon any demand, whether arising out of contract or tort, unless at the time such contract was made or tort committed the corporation had filed its articles of incorporation under the provisions of this act in the office of the Secretary of State, for the purpose of procuring its permit.
“ Sec. 5. Such corporation shall, if its capital stock be one hundred thousand dollars or less, pay a fee of twenty-five dollars to procure such permit; if its capital stock be more than one hundred thousand dollars, and less than five hundred thousand dollars,, it shall pay a fee of fifty dollars; if its capital stock be five hundred thousand dollars, and less than one million dollars, it shall pay a fee of one hundred dollars; if its capital stock shall exceed one million dollars, it shall pay a fee of two hundred dollars.”
In the case of Bateman & Bro. v. The Western Star Milling Company, decided by us at a former day of this term (1 Texas Civil Appeals. 90), this act received careful consideration, and we there held, that in so far as it applies to goods sold in one State to be carried into another, it is in violation of the “ commerce clause ” of the Constitution of the United States, and can furnish no defense to a suit brought for the purchase price.
It does not appear from the agreement in this case, however, that this was an interstate transaction. It seems the goods were sold by appellant to appellee at its place of business in the State of Massachusetts, and it is not stated that it was in the contemplation of the parties that they were to be shipped from that State into this. That the act does not apply to a transaction of this kind, we think there can be no question. It is neither “transacting business in this State,” nor “soliciting business in this State,” nor “ establishing a general or special office in this State;” and it must be one or the other to come within the purview of the statute.
We are therefore of opinion that the judgment of the court below must be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is so ordered.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered January 3, 1893."
216240,W. C. Robinson v. A. K. Moore et al.,1892-10-18,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
December 2, 1885, W. C. Robinson, plaintiff in error, brought this suit against the following persons as defendants, viz.: Alfred K. Moore, W. A. Lowry, Augustus Hooks, Walter M. Robinson, W. L. Robinson, Alice Robinson, and Lizzie Lowry"", the three last named being minors.
Alfred K. Moore is sued as the surviving husband of Paralee Moore, the deceased daughter of plaintiff and his deceased wife.
W. A. Lowry is sued as the surviving husband of Laura Lowry, a deceased daughter of plaintiff and his deceased wife.
Lizzie Lowry is sued as a surviving child of Laura Lowry; and Augustus Hooks is sued as the surviving husband of Mary Robinson, a deceased daughter of plaintiff in error and his deceased wife.
The remaining defendants. Walter M. Robinson, W. L. Robinson, and Alice Robinson, are sued as children of Catherine Robinson, the deceased wife of plaintiff.
The plaintiff sued to remove the cloud from the title to 230 acres of land out of the Susanna Walker survey, in Collin County. He alleged that he intermarried with Catherine E. Barker, November 5, 1851, and that she died in June, 1880; that during the coverture he acquired the 'land in controversy, paying the entire consideration therefor, $1100, out of his separate means; that his wife had no right or title in said property, nor have her heirs; but that from the purchase of the property during the coverture arises the presumption that the land belongs to the community of himself and his wife, and so casts a cloud upon his title. He prays that a decree be rendered,vesting absolute title in him to the property and cancelling all claim of the defendants.
The defendant Walter M. Robinson answered by general demurrer and plea of not guilty; that the land in controversy was the community property of plaintiff and his deceased wife; that plaintiff and his deceased wife were at her death, in June, 1880, the ‘tiwners of the land described in plaintiff’s petition, except the tract hereafter set out as the property of this defendant. In this connection, defendant prayed for partition of said tract of land (less the tract below referred to) between the plaintiff and the defendants. Defendant further pleaded, that improvements, which he itemized, of the value of $3150, were placed upon the land during the coverture, and with community funds; he prayed for partition of these improvements. Finally, this defendant pleaded that he is entitled to a tract of 55 acres, which he particularly described in his answer, of which 42 acres are a part of the land described in plaintiff’s petition. He alleged, that about the year 1872 the plaintiff sold and conveyed to one G-. W. Evans a tract of 60 acres; that Evans had paid a part of the purchase money and had erected improvements on this tract, of which he bad taken possession; that afterwards the sale of this land by plaintiff to Evans was rescinded in consideration of the refunding of the money paid by him and compensation for the improvements; that in February, 1873, plaintiff agreed with defendant that if he would furnish the funds for repayment to Evans, the plaintiff would give him the 55-acre tract in question; that defendant accepted said agreement, and that plaintiff, with means provided by the defendant, refunded the money to Evans and placed defendant in possession of the tract as his home, and promised to execute a deed to him, causing the land to be surveyed, fixing the bearing trees and the corners; that defendant, relying upon this gift or agreement, and with the consent of plaintiff, took possession of the tract about October 1, 1875, and has since continuously held open, notorious, and exclusive possession of the same, and placed improvements thereon (which he itemized) of the value of $3000. He pleaded the statute of three and ten years limitation as to said land. He prayed for specific performance of said agreement, and that he have title to said land against the plaintiff and all the defendants. If this prayer should be granted, he renounced his claim to the improvements placed upon the remainder of the land; if it should not be granted, he prayed for his interest in said improvements, and also for the value of his improvements upon the tract of 55 acres.
The defendants W. L. Robinson, Alice Robinson, and Lizzie Lowry appeared by their guardian ad litem, and pleaded that the tract of land in controversy, with all the improvements thereon, was the community property of plaintiff and his deceased wife, Catharine Robinson. They denied the gift and agreement pleaded by their codefendant, W. C. Robinson; they alleged that if such agreement was made that it was void as a verbal gift; that the 55-acre tract was a part of the homestead at the time, and that their mother did not join in said gift or agreement. They prayed for partition and for general relief.
The plaintiff, in replication to the answer of the defendant Walter M. Robinson, filed a general and two special demurrers and a general denial. The remaining defendants, Alfred K. Moore, W. A. Lowry, and Augustus Hooks, made default.
Our conclusions of fact founded upon findings of the jury in answer to special issues submitted by the court are as follows:
1. W. C. Robinson and Catharine E. Robinson were married in 1851.
2. The land was purchased in 1856 for the purchase price of $1100.
3. The plaintiff paid $640 of the purchase money out of his separate funds and $400- out of community money.
4. Catharine E. Robinson died June 22, 1880, and the following are her heirs and representatives: Walter M. Robinson, W. L. Robinson and Alice Robinson, her children; W. A. Lowry and Lizzie Lowry, surviving husband and daughter respectively of Laura Robinson, daughter of Catharine; Augustus Hooks, surviving husband of Mary Robinson, who died in 1884, after her mother, Catharine Robinson.
5. Improvements placed on said lands (excluding the tract claimed by W. M. Robinson) amounted to $1030, and were community property.
6. W. C. Robinson made to W. M. Robinson an absolute verbal gift of the 55-acre tract described in his answer, which land was no part of the homestead. In October, 1875, W. C. Robinson put W. M. Robinson in possession of this land. W. M. Robinson has continuously since that date remained in open and notorious possession of the land, and has placed upon it improvements to the value of $800, in pursuance of the gift. W. C. Robinson, in the month of June, after possession had been taken by Walter M. Robinson, caused the tract in question to be surveyed and its lines and corners marked and fixed.
The jury also, in its conclusions, found that 195 acres of the land described in plaintiff’s petition was the homestead of plaintiff and his wife Catharine at her death, and it is the homestead still.
The court rendered judgment as follows:
1. It vested in the plaintiff, W. C. Robinson, title to T8T7„-, and to the other defendants (except W. M. Robinson, who has renounced his claim to the same) title to T2y\- of the land described in plaintiff’s petition, excluding the 55-acre tract claimed by Walter M. Robinson; and declared the land, less said 55-acre tract, to be the homestead of the plaintiff, W. C. Robinson.
2. It decreed that the improvements on the said land at the death' of Catharine E. Robinson were of the value of $1030; that they were erected with community funds of W. C. Robinson and his wife Catharine; and it ordered that “ one-half of the value of said improvements, to-wit, $515, be vested in the defendants, except the defendant Walter M. Robinson, and that the same shall be a lien on said premises in favor of said defendants in the said sum of $515.” It decreed to Walter M. Robinson title to the 55-acre tract claimed by him against the plaintiff and against all of the remaining defendants. Among other things unnecessary to mention, it decreed that R. C. White be allowed as guardian ad litem a fee of $10, “ to be taxed as costs against the defendant Alice Moore.”
From the judgment so rendered W. C. Robinson prosecutes this writ of error.
The first assignment of error is, that “ The court erred in overruling the demurrer and exceptions in plaintiff’s first supplemental petition, filed July 6, 1886, in reply to the amended original answer of Walter M. Robinson, filed June 25,1886.”
This assignment, inviting a review of the court’s action with reference to several matters, without specifying the ground of error relied upon, is too general to require consideration. The propositions under it can not be invoked -to assist it. Wé consequently ignore it. Jackson v. Cassidy, 68 Texas, 282.
In the eighth special issue submitted by the court the jury were instructed to state 1 ‘Whether or not W. M. Robinson went into the actual and exclusive possession of the land (claimed by him), and made valuable improvements thereon in pursuance of the gift (from his father to him), and whether or not he has since remained in possession thereof, and whether or not such possession has been open and notorious.”
We have already set out the finding of the jury in response to this issue. It will be observed that the finding does not, in terms, use the word “ exclusive.” For this reason it is urged in the second assignment of error that the finding is not responsive to the issue, and that the court therefore erred in rendering judgment against plaintiff in favor of W. M. Robinson. No statement of facts is found in the record. A motion for a new trial was filed, but was never, it seems, called to the attention of the court. The court evidently construed the finding to be responsive to the issue submitted, and we are not prepared to state that the interpretation was incorrect. We think that the finding already quoted indicates, in substance, that the possession of Robinson was open, continuous, notorious, and exclusive. There is no merit in this assignment.
The fifth assignment of error is as follows: “ The court erred in rendering judgment against W. C. Robinson, in favor of Alfred K. Moore, for any portion of the land or improvements in controversy.”
Alfred K. Moore was a defendant, but, under the finding of the jury, was not an heir of Catharine E. Robinson. The judgment awarded to the defendants, except-Walter M. Robinson, T2-3g- of the land in controversy. This was the community interest of the deceased wife, Catharine Robinson, and as Alfred K. Moore was not an heir of Catharine, he should have been excluded from the decree. We regard the failure to exclude him as a matter of mere clerical oversight, which will be here corrected and the judgment accordingly reformed.
In the eighth assignment of error complaint is made that the court erred in submitting to the jury the question of the value of the improvements put on the land in controversy by community property, as such value existed at the time of the death of Catharine E. Robinson.
This land was claimed by the plaintiff to be his separate property. Defendants reply, that if such was the fact, certain improvements had been built upon it by money belonging to the community, and that they were entitled to be reimbursed for their mother’s share of the community applied to these improvements. It seems to be settled, that where a husband improves his separate property with the funds of the community estate, the wife, or her heirs, will be entitled to reimbursement out of his separate property to the extent of their share of the community; that their demand for such reimbursement is in the nature of a charge or an equitable lien upon the property so improved. Rice v. Rice, 21 Texas, 58; Cameron v. Fay, 55 Texas, 61; Roberson v. McIlhenny, 59 Texas, 615; Furrh v. Winston, 66 Texas, 525; Clift v. Clift, 72 Texas, 149.
This issue, therefore, springs naturally from the contention of the parties. It is urged, however, that the issue was especially irrelevant, because the property was at the wife’s death, and still is, the homestead of W. C. Robinson, and that the latter, for this reason, could not be held responsible for the value of improvements, except, at most, according to such value as it might be ascertained when the homestead character should terminate. How far this question of improvements, in connection with this assignment, or with the tenth assignment to be considered, might be affected, if at all, by the fact that the property is impressed with the homestead character, we are not required here to consider. The pleadings nowhere raise-the question of homestead; and though both the verdict and the judgment declared the property to be the homestead, they, being without basis in the allegations, can not be held to affect any issue here presented. Hall v. Jackson, 3 Texas, 305; Denison v. League, 16 Texas, 400; Lemmon v. Hanley, 28 Texas, 219.
The defendant Walter M. Robinson renounced his interest in the community estate. The court adjudged this renunciation to inure to the benefit of the remaining heirs of Catharine Robinson. It is contended that the father should have had the benefit of this disclaimer. The father had no interest in the community share of his deceased wife; her children did. The disclaimer by one of them, in the absence of special direction by him, would; we think, inure to the benefit of the remaining children of his mother.
Alice Robinson, a minor defendant, was represented by R. C. White, guardian ad litem, to whom the judgment awarded a fee, to be taxed as costs against Alice Moore. This is complained of as error. As there was no such party to the suit as Alice Moore, it is plain that the entry of this name, instead of the name Alice Robinson, was purely a clerical error. This will be corrected, and the judgment in this respect reformed.
The tenth assignment of error is to the effect that the court erred in rendering judgment against W. C. Robinson in favor of the heirs of his deceased wife in the sum of $515, and in adjudging said sum to constitute a lien on plaintiff’s land. As we have already pointed out, the jury found that W. C. Robinson had expended out of the community funds $1030, in placing permanent and valuable improvements upon a tract of land of which he owned an undivided interest of and his wife an undivided interest of ytü- Husband and wife were thus, in the proportion named, tenants in common of the tract in question, and on her death her heirs succeeded to her tenancy. Five hundred and ten dollars of her money had been by her cotenant applied to the erection of the improvements. Where one cotenant, with the consent of the other cotenant, places improvements of the character named upon property held in common, the latter cotenant 11 will be liable to contribute his just share with interest.” Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law, vol. 11, p. 1106.
In Freeman on Cotenancy and Partition, section 262, we find the following language: “ If a cotenant has assented to or authorized improvements to be made, he is answerable therefor, and a lien exists against his property for the amount thereof against him and his grantees with notice.” Here there is no question of assent or authority, because the tenant making the improvements is the one sought to be charged. As the head of the connubial partnership, he was authorized to use the community funds, with or without the consent of the wife. If, therefore, he used her funds in improving his property, the lien to the extent of such use exists in her favor against the property so improved, and the court was correct in so holding. Torrey v. Martin, 4 S. W. Rep., 642.
We think, however, that there was error as to the amount of the lien adjudged by the court. Mrs. Catharine Robinson was the owner of an interest of of the land improved. To that extent her property must be held to have been benefited from the money expended, and she should be proportionately charged. Again, the plaintiff husband expended upon the improvements $515, his community share, from which the wife’s interest must be held to have received its proportionate benefit. To the extent of this benefit the husband should be credited. We could make the calculation and here reform the judgment, limiting the lien to the proper sum; but there are suggestions in the record that the behests of justice would probably be best subserved by remanding the cause on this issue of improvements and on the issue of partition raised by the pleadings, and the equities of the parties in connection therewith.
Delivered October 18, 1892.
We conclude, and so order, that the judgment in favor of the defendant Walter M. Robinson shall be in all things affirmed, and that he recover of W. C. Robinson his costs in both courts incurred; that the judgment shall be reformed in so far as A. K. Moore is in any sense a beneficiary therein, and in so far as it awards a fee in favor of the guardian ad litem R. C. White, against Alice Moore instead of Alice Robinson; that the findings of the jury fixing the relative interests of the parties in the 195-acre tract in controversy and T^¡- respectively) shall be deemed conclusive; that the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded on the issue of improvements and of partition connected therewith, and on the finding of the homestead, which was without support in the pleadings; and that on another trial the deliberations of the court or jury be confined to this issue of improvements and partition.
W. C. Robinson will recover all costs incurred by him in this court from the defendants in error, except Walter M. Robinson.
Reversed and remanded.
Justice Head, did not sit in this case."
219077,L. C. Downtain v. C. U. Connellee,1893-01-03,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
This suit originated in the Justice Court, where appellee pleaded in offset to the account sued on by appellant a number of items; and on appeal to the County Court he was permitted, over the objection of the appellant, to add to this counter-claim items aggregating 8107.45 more than the sums pleaded by him in the Justice Court. We think this was error. It has been settled that article 316 of the Revised Statutes, which prohibits any setoff or counter-claim from being set up by the defendant in the County Court which was not pleaded in the court below, in cases brought by certiorari, applies as well to a case taken to the County Court by appeal. Curry v. Terrell, 1 W. & W. C. C., 239; Blanton v. Langston, 60 Texas, 149.
The only answer appellee makes to this is, that appellant was himself permitted to amend his claim by adding new items in the County Court. This, however, seems to have been done without objection from appellee, and we are of opinion that this furnishes no sufficient reason for overruling the objection of appellant. We do not wish, however, to be understood as holding that the amendment' made by appellant was subject to exception had it been interposed by appellee. As to this we express no opinion.
One of the items in appellee’s counter-claim was 820, claimed to have been paid by A. S. Connellee, a brother of appellee, to appellant, and to prove this item said Connellee was allowed to testify in reference to its payment, over the objection of appellant, as follows: “I do not know anything from my own personal knowledge, but I do from circumstances. My wife told me that I borrowed 820 from her, and that at the time I borrowed it I told her I wanted it to pay Dr. Downtain for brother Charley; but I do not know whether I paid it or not, or anything further about it.” That this evidence was pure hearsay and inadmissible, we think quite too clear for argument.
For the errors above indicated, the judgment of the court below 17111 be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.

219045,S. J. Wright v. The Red River County Bank,1892-01-03,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
The judgment appealed from in this case declares the existence of a lien in favor of appellee on a certain tract of land therein described, ordering the sale of the same, to secure the payment of the following debts in the following order:
First. The note of one Fleming, without security.
Second. Two notes of said Fleming, with O’Neill and others as sureties on one, and Silberberg & Patton as sureties on the other (against which sureties judgment was also rendered).
Third. A certain indebtedness of said Fleming, paid by appellant and others as his sureties.
The record contains conclusions of law and fact and a statement of facts.
The sixth finding of fact, that the note upon which Silberberg & Patton were sureties was secured by a lien on said land, appears to be unsustained by the statement of facts. This probaby resulted from an oversight in making up the statement of facts. If appellant had definitely assigned error upon the failure of the statement of facts to sustain the sixth finding of fact (of which he complains in his brief under a rather general assignment), it would have become necessary to either reform the judgment or remand the cause for a new trial, provided the appeal had been perfected so as to give this court jurisdiction. The appeal bond is payable to the Red River County Bank alone. It thus appears that the interests of Silberberg & Patton might be affected by the judgment to be entered on this appeal, without their being before the court as parties to the appeal. Their interests, as well as the interests of O’Neil and others, are adverse to the interests of appellant to the extent of the priority of their several liens.
The appeal must therefore be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Young v. Russell, 60 Texas, 684, and cases there cited.

219061,S. C. Gatewood et al. v. Scurlock & Rutledge,1893-01-03,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
Appellant S. C. Gatewood, according to the testimony of herself and husband, J. C. Gatewood, was induced to join in the conveyance of their homestead, the separate property of the husband, in consideration of the proceeds of the sale becoming her separate property. In pursuance of this understanding, the homestead was conveyed and the money and notes received in payment were delivered to the wife as her separate property. Thereafter a portion ■of the money was invested in cattle, which, by the terms of the bill of sale, were conveyed to the separate use of the wife. Subsequently, thirty-six of these cattle were seized under execution as the property of the husband, and were promptly claimed by the wife, who prosecutes this appeal from a judgment rendered against her.. There was a trial by jury, but the court instructed them to return a verdict for appellees; holding, in effect, that personal property received in payment for the homestead of an insolvent debtor, when transferred to the wife to be her separate property, upon the sole consideration of obtaining her consent to the sale, is not thereby withdrawn from the reach of the husband’s creditors. The very opposite of this is decided in the case of Blum v. Light, 81 Texas, 414, the facts of which are quite similar to the facts of this case. That case, however, was not reported until after the trial in this case. It follows, that the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial, in order that the jury, under a proper charge, may pass upon the facts and determine whether the transaction between Gatewood and wife is really what it purports to be or only colorable; and it is accordingly so ordered.
Reversed and remanded.

216254,J. C. Roberts v. D. M. Helm,1892-10-25,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This suit was brought in the District Court of Eastland County by appellant, J. C. Roberts, against appellee, D. M. Helm, to recover a strip or tract of land in Eastland County, 330 varas in width and 2736 varas in length, containing 160 acres. The appellant claims this land to be a part of the W. G. McGrew survey. The appellee claims that it is no part of the McGrew survey, and that, as vacant public domain, lying between the McGrew survey west of it and the John Bradley survey east of it, he pre-empted it. The McGrew survey, among other matters, calls to course from its beginning corner east 1650 varas to a stake on the north line of the John Bradley survey; thence south with the west line of the John Bradley survey, passing its southwest corner. To reach a stake on the north line of the Bradley, the course of the north line of the McGrew would be seriously deflected to the north, and the distance traversed in reaching the west line of the Bradley would be 1990 varas, instead of 1650 varas, as called for in the McGrew field notes.
One J. P. Davidson testified for the plaintiff, that in 1871, as county surveyor of Eastland County, he surveyed the G. W. McGrew survey; that he was actually on the ground; that he ran the north and east lines, the east line of the McGrew and the west line of the Bradley being identical. Evidence, on the other hand, was introduced for the defendant impeaching the correctness of Davidson’s statement, and tending to show that no actual survey was made; that the McGrew survey “ was platted on paper as office work.”
Delivered October 25, 1892.
Such being the condition of the testimony, the court instructed the jury to the effect:
1. That if they should believe the statement of the witness Davidson, no vacancy would exist and the3r would find for plaintiff.
2. That, on the other hand, if the3r should believe that no actual surArey was made by Davidson, but that he “platted the survey without actually running the lines, course and distance would control,” and they would fix the east boundary of the McGrew 1650 varas east of its northwest corner; and if the line thus fixed was west of the land claimed b3r defendant, they would find for the defendant.
The jury, evidently influenced ly the latter instruction, returned a verdict accordingly.
This latter charge is complained of as error.
It will be noted that the other calls in the patent were thus b3r the court subordinated to course and distance. Among the remaining calls is one for the southwest corner of the John Bradley survey as on the east line of the McGrew. This southwest corner of the Bradley is well established. Can it be stated, then, as a matter of law, that in the absence of an actual surve3'' the juiy should be instructed that the McGrew should be identified by reference alone to course and distance ? We think not. When no survey has been made on the ground, the rule is, that in finding the true locality of the land in question, the court or jury should look to all the calls in the patent, and from them should conclude what was the particular land intended to be conveyed. The intention of the State and of the grantee is of controlling force in such investigation, and this intention must be sought by means of all the calls, “matters of description,” in the patent. It is true that such matters of description as are referred to b3r mistake should be disregarded, but in a trial b3r jury the question as to what was the subject matter of such reference should be left to the jury. We think the court erred in the charge complained of, in confining the jury, as a matter of law, to course and distance, in the absence of an actual survey, as the exclusive test of the true localit3T of the McGrew survey. Boon v. Hunter, 62 Texas, 588.
We find no merit in the remaining assignments relied upon.
For the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded."
216214,Gulf Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. M. S. Johnson et al.,1892-10-25,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On January 22, 1887, A. D. Johnson, while in the discharge of his duty as brakeman for the appellant, was killed by the derailment of the car upon which he was riding, caused by a defective stock gap in appellant’s track between Cleburne and Alvarado, in Johnson County. At the time of his death the said Johnson was 29 years old and in good health; was a man of good morals, industrious and attentive to his business, and had a life-expectancy of 36.03 years. He had been working for himself ever since he was 18 years old, but had accumulated no property, everything he made going to the support of his family. At the time of his death he had been in the employ of appellant as brakeman for about four years, and was earning either $60 or $65 per month. He had been married eight years to appellee M. S. Johnson, and had one child, the appellee Murdie Lea Johnson, a boy, aged 2 years at the time of the death of his father as aforesaid. Upon one occasion during his employment with appellant the said A. D. Johnson had been employed as passenger conductor on one of its trains for one or two trips, and upon one trip had acted as baggage master. He does not seem to have been a man of any special education or business qualification, but was a good average brakeman. The verdict was in favor of appellees for $18,000, to be divided equally between them. The verdict established ordinary negligence on the part of appellant, and in this respect was well supported by the evidence.
We have examined the record in this case with much care, and have been forced to the conclusion that the verdict for $18,000 is excessive and should be reversed. We realize the difficulty that necessarily attends the assessing of the amount of damage to be allowed in this class of cases, and for this reason the verdict of the jury should be entitled to more than ordinary weight. At the same time the law allows such damage to be estimated only upon the basis of pecuniary compensation, and demands that all considerations of sympathy and passion be excluded. It is true in arriving at this pecuniary compensation, in many cases there is much to be taken into consideration beside the actual money contributed by the deceased to those entitled to sue. The circumstances in many cases will justify a finding that, had not death prevented, promotion in his line of business, with increased earnings, would have resulted in increased contributions by deceased to those dependent upon him, and in such cases the jury would be authorized to take this into consideration in arriving at the amount of their verdict. In other cases the evidence may show that deceased was in the habit of rendering to those claiming damages for his death other valuable services beside contributions in money, and in such cases the probabilities as to this being continued in future, had not death resulted, could be weighed by the jury. A husband might and usually does render to the wife much valuable aid outside of his earnings in money, of which she is deprived by his death; and the jury, should it see proper, has the right to compensate her for this loss according to the circumstances of the particular case. A child, and especially a very young boy, is deprived of much that would be of value to him by the death of a father who, had he lived, would have contributed to his comfort, assistance, education, and training in many ways in addition to the actual money he would have furnished, and should a jury give reasonable compensation for this loss no just complaint could be made. 3 Wood's Ry. Law, 1539, 1540; Pierce on Rys., 397-399.
But in all these cases the jury must be reasonable. They must not allow their sympathy or passion to carry them beyond the pecuniary compensation allowed by law. In the case before us the jury has allowed each of the appellees a sum of money which, at the current rate of interest, would annually yield a sum considerably in excess of the total wages deceased was earning at the time of his death. That each of them could not expect to receive the full amount of his earnings is plain from the evidence, both being entirely dependent thereon. In fact, both together could not expect to receive all of such earnings, because the evidence shows that the deceased had no property, and it was necessary for his own maintenance to be taken from his wages. It will thus be seen that the jury in fixing the compensation to be allowed appellees have estimated the incidental services deceased may have been expected to render his wife and child at a sum very greatly in excess of the assistance he was able to render them through his regular employment, and without deciding that this might not be- justified in some cases, we can find nothing in the record to sustain their conclusions as applied to this case.
Deceased is not shown to have been possessed of any special qualifications to make his prospects of promotion peculiarly bright and rapid, or his incidental services more than ordinarily valuable, and we can not sustain a verdict which in effect finds that the services an ordinary brakeman renders his wife and child during the brief intervals he is able to be with them from his work is of so much greater pecuniary value to them than the amount he earns in his regular employment, even when we take into consideration the usual chances of promotion. The amount given the child Murdie Lea Johnson by the verdict in this case, if kept at interest at the current rate, would produce a sum sufficient to support and educate him in the very best schools during his minority and at his majority start him in business with a fortune of at least $10,000; a result, we feel constrained to hold, he could not have reasonably anticipated had his father lived.
The court in several paragraphs of the charge to the jury used expressions which if standing alone might have been construed as requiring appellant to furnish a safe roadbed and track for the use of its employes. It is well settled in this State that ordinary care in this respect is all that is required of the master for the protection of his servants, and the use of the word “ safe” in this connection has been several times condemned by our Supreme Court. Railway v. Williams, 82 Texas, 343; Railway v. Wells, 81 Texas, 685. It is unnecessary for us to decide whether the whole charge taken together in this case was objectionable in this respect or not, and we only call attention to it in view of another trial.
Appellant earnestly contends, that if the death of Johnson was caused by one of its cattle guards being out of repair, and this was the fault of its employes, it would only be liable for gross negligence, the death having occurred prior to the amendment of our statute upon this subject. The court, however, tried the case upon the theory that ordinary negligence would render appellant liable, and with this view of the law we fully concur. There are certain duties devolved upon the master as a personal obligation for which he is held responsible, although they are in fact performed bjr his employes, and it is well settled in this State that the duty of the master in reference to the roadbed and track he furnishes his employes to pass over is of this class. Railway v. Dunham, 49 Texas, 189; Railway v. Geiger, 79 Texas, 22. And when negligence in respect of one of these duties is the cause of the death it will be considered as having been caused by the act of the master himself, and not by the act of his servant or agent within the meaning of our statute. The last case cited above is directly in point.
Delivered October 25, 1892.
Let the judgment below be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial on account of the excessive verdict.
Reversed and remanded."
219172,The Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. Mary J. Bond,1893-01-03,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On the night of August 5, 1888, Edward F. Bond, while in the employ of John C. Brown, receiver of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, as switchman in the yards at Fort Worth, was killed by being run over by the engine upon which he was braking.
His death was caused by a pile of loose cinders, which had been unloaded by the track foreman on the day previous to the accident, near one of the rails and a short distance from the switch Bond was required in the discharge of his duty to operate. The cinders being about the color of the ground, and Bond not knowing of their presence near the track, in the performance of his duty stepped off the engine upon which he was riding, on to the cinders, and was thrown under the wheels. The cinders were unloaded as aforesaid for the purpose of being used in repairing the yard. The yard where the injury was caused was used in operating the cars of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, and the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company.
Some of the witnesses speak of that part of the yard where the injury was caused as the yards of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, and others say the yard belonged to the Texas & Pacific Railway Company,, but was called the Missouri Pacific yards. The evidence as to the particular relation that each of these companies bore to the yards and to their operation is very unsatisfactory, being confined to the testimony of subordinate employes, who show that the only information they have is such inferences as they dr'ew from the fact that they were paid by one company or the other. It seems that at the immediate time of the injury, both the employes operating the engine and the track foreman who deposited the cinders were paid by the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, or Brown,.its receiver, but only a few weeks previous to this time they had been paid by appellant.
Appellee brought this suit to recover under the statute for the death of said Bond against both Brown, receiver, and appellant, alleging joint ownership and operation of the yard, but before the trial she dismissed as to the receiver of the Texas & Pacific, and prosecuted the suit to judgment against appellant alone. The judgment was for 85500 against appellant, from which this appeal is prosecuted. The suit was prosecuted by appellee, who was the surviving wife, for the use of herself and the children of Bond, and the amount recovered was apportioned by the verdict, $4000 to appellee, $1200 to a minor son, and 8100 each to three married daughters.
It is well settled by repeated decisions of our Supreme Court since the case of Railway v. Dunham, 49 Texas, 181, that an employe charged by the master with the duty of keeping in repair a railway track is not a fellow servant with the employes operating the train, who sustain injuries through the negligence of such track repairers in the performance of this duty. The death of Bond was caused by the unquestioned negligence of the track foreman in leaving the cinders adjacent to the track the train men were required to pass over in the discharge of their duty at night, and for such negligence the master must be held liable.
Where a railroad track or yard is shown to be the property of one company, we think the natural inference, in the absence of evidence, would be that such company is the one that keeps it in repair. Also, if a railway track or yard is shown to be used indiscriminately by two or more companies, in the absence of other evidence explaining the particular nature of the contract between the companies, we think the fair inference would be that they all contribute jointly in keeping it in repair. In this case the evidence shows without contradiction that the cars both of the Texas & Pacific and of the Missouri Pacific Railway Companies were operated in these yards and over the track where the injury occurred, and at the time of the accident deceased was engaged in transferring some cars for appellant as well as the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe. It seems, however, that at this particular time these employes were drawing their pay entirely from the Texas & Pacific, but only a short time before this they had been drawing their pay from the Missouri Pacific.
Appellee in her petition charged that the two companies were engaged jointly in operating the yards, and appellant did not upon the trial see proper to introduce in evidence its contract with the other company, but left the jury to draw their inference as to this from"" the testimony of subordinate employes, who expressly state that their only information upon the subject is, that they were paid by one company or the other at the respective times stated by them. The court below in its charge, which is not complained of, required the jury, before finding for appellee, to find that appellant exercised some control in these yards; and after a careful examination of the statement of facts, we are of opinion that the verdict of the jury finding that it did have such control should not be disturbed by us.
As the particular nature of this contract was peculiarly within the knowledge of the parties thereto, and could easily have been shown by appellant, we think every presumption should be indulged against it on account of its failure to produce better evidence. Had appellant shown that the yards belonged exclusively to the Texas & Pacific, and that said company alone was charged with the duty of keeping them in repair, and appellant only paid it a consideration for handling its cars in said yard, we do not think it could be held liable to the servants of said company for an injury caused by a defect in the yard; but we are of opinion that the jury was authorized by the evidence to find that such was not the real contract between these companies. Railway v. Dorsey, 66 Texas, 148; Railway v. Jones, 75 Texas, 151.
This being an action to recover damages for the pecuniary injury suffered by appellee from the death of Bond, we think the witness J. M. Rogers was properly allowed to state that Bond was kind and affectionate to his family, and that he was an indulgent father and husband. In such cases this evidence is generally admitted as bearing upon the amount of pecuniary benefit the plaintiff might have expected to receive from deceased had he not been killed.
At the time Bond was run over by the engine, and while he was still under the wheels, the witness Menshaw came to where he was, and immediately upon his arrival, which was only a few moments after the injury, Bond said to him: “ You know what caused this, Ed. It was the cinders; they gave way as I stepped off the tender and rolled me under the wheels. I did not know that they were there.’ ’ That this was properly admitted as a part of the res geste is now settled by the decisions in this State. Railway v. Anderson, 82 Texas, 516; Railway v. Robertson, 82 Texas, 657; Railway v. Hall, 83 Texas, 675.
Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should in all things be affirmed.
Affirmed.

216303,"Tarlton, Jordan & Tarlton v. W. A. Kirkpatrick et al.",1892-10-25,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On January 26, 1874, duplicate certificate No. issued to the heirs of Samuel Shackelford, was located in Hill County, and a survey embracing 682 acres, including the land in controversy, was made thereon, and the field notes returned to the General Land Office. In August, 1887, these field notes were corrected so as to leave out all of the 682 acres except the 178 acres in controversy in this suit, and upon these corrected field notes patent was issuéd dated the 5th day of October, 1887. Appellants, claiming under this location and patent, filed this suit in trespass to try title against appellees in the District Court of Hill County, September 27, 1888. Appellees each pleaded not guilty and the statutes of limitation of five and ten years, but neither of them described in their pleading the particular part of the land they claim. It seems, however, from the evidence that appellee Kirkpatrick only claims 112 acres described in deed from McKinnon & Call to him, dated April 21, 1883, and recorded same day, and the appellee Huff claims 27.6 acres described in deed from McKinnon & Call to him, dated April 21, 1883, and recorded same day, and 19.8 acres described in deed from G-. Y. Tarver to him, dated July 24, 1882, and recorded same day.
Appellee Allen does not seem to have claimed any part of the land upon the trial. McKinnon & Call claimed the land conveyed by them to Kirkpatrick and Huff as aforesaid under a deed from Gr. Y. Tarver to them, dated April 18, 1883, and recorded same day. This deed is for 139.8 acres, described as part of the M. B. Atkinson 200 acres survey, giving the field notes. There was also in evidence a deed from Gr. Y. Tarver to J. P. Allen, dated February 4, 1884, recorded March 19, 1884, for 25.8 acres. G. Y. Tarver claimed the land conveyed by him to Huff, McKinnon & Call, and Allen as aforesaid under a deed made by W. L. Booth, as administrator of J. R. Grover, deceased, dated March 16, 1875, and recorded July 17, 1879. In this deed the land is described as “ 200 acres of land in Hill County, Texas, lying about 6 miles northeast from Hillsboro, and located by virtue of part of M. B. Atkinson 320-acre certificate.”
There is nothing in the record to show how the estate of Grover acquired any interest in this land, and this deed was introduced only to sustain the pleas of limitation. The record, however, shows that two certificates were issued; one to Milton B. Atkinson by Barnard E. Bee, Secretary of War, No. 1101, for 320 acres, which was duly approved by the Commissioner of Claims and located in Ellis County; and one to M. B. Atkinson, by James S. Gillett, Adjutant General, No. 1027, for 320 acres, which was never approved by the Commissioner of Claims, but was attempted to be located in Hill County in 1871, in two surveys of 200 acres and 120 acres respectively, and the field notes of said surveys were returned to the General Land Office during said year. Said 200 acres survey embraced the land in controversy. The Commissioner of the General Land Office held this certificate and location invalid and refused patent thereon, and subsequently issue’d patent upon the Shackelford location as aforesaid, although later in date.
At the time Tarver purchased from Grover’s administrator (which was in October, 1874, although the deed was not made until 1875), one J. P. Allen had from 7 to 8 acres of the land in controversy enclosed with his own land adjoining it, and a short time after said purchase said Allen became the tenant of Tarver. As to this tenancy, Tarver testifies he' had a written contract with Allen by which the latter was to keep the land for.five years, and to protect the timber and grass, and further on he says Allen had possession of the land as his tenant until he sold it. Allen says he does not remember when he rented the land from Tarver; that he lived there before and has lived there ever since; that nothing was said as to how long he was to keep it; that he occupied the land all the time for Tarver until he purchased from him; that he was to keep it until he was dismissed as tenant, which had never been done. Nothing is said in the evidence as to whether or not Allen was regarded by the parties as the tenant of McKinnon & Call or of Kirkpatrick during the interval between their purchase and the time they took possession thereunder. All of the improvements upon the land with which Tarver was connected were upon the 25.8 acres conveyed by him to Allen in 1884. Tarver paid all taxes on the land while he claimed it, but neither Kirkpatrick nor Huff paid taxes for the year 1885 or 1886. In 1884 A. M. Allen, one of the appellees, undertook to pre-empt 160 acres on the north side of the land, and during the years 1885 and 1886 he paid the tax thereon; and verbal evidence was admitted by the court over the objection of appellants that about the time of the institution of this suit he, joined by his wife, had made deeds to Kirkpatrick and Huff for the portion of this 160 acres claimed by them respectively.
McKinnon & Call do not seem to have ever had possession of the land while they claimed it, unless Allen be held to have been their tenant. Huff seems to have taken possession immediately upon his purchases. Kirkpatrick is shown to have taken possession sometime during the year 1883, but no idea is given as to the length of time that elapsed after his purchase nor the circumstances attending the delay.
The case was submitted to the court without a jury, and judgment was rendered in favor of appellees upon the following special findings, to-wit:
“1. That the plaintiffs have by the patent, deeds, etc., in evidence the legal title to the land described in the petition.
“ 2. That G-. Y. Tarver had had and held peaceable and adverse possession of said land by his tenant, using and enjoying the same, for a period of more than ten years next before the filing of this suit.
“3. That the defendants and those under whom they claim have had peaceable and adverse possession of the land in dispute, cultivating and using the same and paying taxes thereon, for a period of more than five years next before the filing of this suit.
“ That under the facts as here found the court finds as a matter of law that the defendants are entitled to recover under the statutes of five and ten years limitations.”
And from this judgment appellants have prosecuted this appeal, and have brought the whole case here for revision upon a statement of facts as well as upon such special findings.
It will be seen from the foregoing conclusions of fact that the finding of the court below to the effect that Gr. Y. Tarver held possession of the land for ten years can not be supported by the evidence. The date of Tarver’s deed was in 1875, although the order of confirmation was in October, 1874. The sale of 19.8 acres to Huff was in July, 1882, and the sale of the 139.8 acres to McKinnon & Call was in April, 1883. The sale of the 25.8 acres to J. P. Allen in February, 1884, is not in controversy, he not being a party to this suit. It will thus be seen that less than nine years had elapsed from the date of the confirmation of the sale to Tarver by the Probate Court until he had parted with all title to the land in controversy. It is true there appears in the statement of facts some general statements to the effect that Tarver purchased sometime in 1873 or 1874, and took possession by his tenant some four or five months thereafter, but we do not regard this as entitled to any consideration in fixing these dates, when they are definitely shown by the record. But even if it had been shown that Tarver had possession years before 1874, it could not avail in this case. It will be noticed that the location upon which the patent was issued under which appellants claim was not made until January 26, 1874, and that limitation would not run against such title until this date is well settled in this State. Wood v. Welder, 42 Texas, 410; Kimbro v. Hamilton, 28 Texas, 565. The finding of fact made by the court below as to the five years statute is also defective, in that it does not show that appellees were claiming under deeds duly registered, and it will therefore be necessary- for us to investigate as to the rights of the parties as disclosed by the statement of facts.
The finding of the court that Tarver held possession for ten years we think can fairly be construed as a finding that Allen, from sometime in 1874 until Tarver sold the land, was the tenant of the latter, and that his possession was of such notoriety as to fulfill the requirements of the statute of limitations if continued for the requisite time; but we have already seen that Tarver did not hold for ten years after the location appellees seek to prescribe against before he sold; and to complete the bar it will be necessary to supplement his possession with that of his vendees, if the facts will authorize this to be done. As to the 19.8 acres conveyed by Tarver to Huff July 24, 1882, we think the record sufficiently shows that there was no such break in the possession as would stop the running of the statute, and that as to this part of the land the bar is complete, and the judgment to that extent should be affirmed; but as to the remainder of the land there is more difficulty. When Tarver sold to McKinnon & Call it does not appear from the record either that they took actual possession themselves or that Allen was to continue to hold it for them as their tenant. The land so conveyed seems to have included none of the improvements claimed by either Tarver or Allen. If Allen had been in actual possession of the part of the land conveyed to McKinnon & Call, and had continued such possession during the three, or four days they kept the land, we would have no difficulty in holding that during this time he would be considered their tenant, and his possession their possession, so as to prevent any break in the running of the statute. Brownson v. Scanlan, 59 Texas, 227; Heflin v. Burns, 70 Texas, 353. But this does not seem to have been the nature of Allen’s possession. He seems only to have been looking after this part of the land for Tarver while he owned it, in consideration of the use of a small part of the tract in his own enclosure, and when Tarver’s title ceased he does not seem to have considered that he had anything further to do with it. When the unimproved part of a tract of land is severed by sale from the improvements, ordinarily the statute ceases to run as to the part that is unimproved. Cunningham v. Frandtzen, 26 Texas, 38.
In this case the record does not show that McKinnon & Call ever expected to take actual possession of the land, so as to raise the question whether or not they would be allowed a reasonable time in which to do this; nor does it appear that they were in any way acting for Kirkpatrick and Huff in making the purchase from Tarver, so as to connect their possession direct with his, as seems to have been done in the case of Ileflin v. Burns, 70 Texas,-353, cited above. So far as we can see from the record, there was a complete break in the possession at McKinnon & Call as to the land conveyed to them by Tarver, which includes the 112 acres claimed by Kirkpatrick and the 27.6 acres tract claimed by Huff in this suit. It also seems that Kirkpatrick took possession-of the 112 acres claimed by him in 1883, but how long in said year after he purchased from McKinnon & Call does not appear. Where land is in the actual possession of the owner, a reasonable time under all the circumstances will be allowed upon its sale for the purchaser to take possession before a break in the running of the statute will be declared. Whitehead v.-Foley, 28 Texas, 15. But in this case there is not sufficient in the record to enable us to say that the length of time taken by Kirkpatrick was reasonable, even though there had been no break at McKinnon & Call. We are neither informed as to the length of time taken by him, nor as to the circumstances under which it was taken.
What we have said as to the break in possession at McKinnon & Call applies also to the claims of Kirkpatrick and Huff under the five years statute. Tarver’s deed was not recorded until July 17, 1879, and therefore five years had not elapsed before his conveyance to McKinnon <fc Call, April 18, 1883, when the break occurred. Kirkpatrick and Huff each took possession under recorded deeds in 1883, and have remained in possession since that time; so that more than five years may have elapsed after the beginning of such possession before the institution of this suit. But neither of them paid taxes on the land for the years 1885 and 1886. To remedy this they seek to show that they have acquired the title of A. M. Allen, who did pay for those years. The answer to this is:
1. When Allen paid these taxes he neither had possession nor claimed the land under a registered deed..
2. The evidence showed that the conveyance from Allen and wife to Kirkpatrick and Huff were both in writing; and if this evidence was offered to show that title had passed by the conveyance, the deeds should have been produced, and appellants’ objection on account of their nonproduction should have been sustained.
3. To enable Kirkpatrick and Huff to tack their possession under the McKinnon & Call title to the title acquired from Allen it would be necessary for them to show that the Allen title was also registered. In other words, possession, payment of taxes, and registered deed must all concur to make the statute available. As said in Whitehead v. Foley, 28 Texas, 289: “A party who claims to have acquired a title to the land of another, with no other evidence of right than a possession of five years under a deed recorded, ought to show a compliance with the terms prescribed by the statute perfect in every particular.”
Appellants also contend that the possession of J. P. Allen by reason of his having 7 to 8 acres of the land in his own enclosure was not sufficient to make the statute apply to the remainder of the tract, and cite Bracken v. Jones, 63 Texas, as authority. In that case the one whose fence was over the line did not profess to hold for the one who claimed the remainder of the tract; while in this there was an express tenancy, with the understanding that the possession of the tenant should extend to the whole tract, and, as we said above, we think the finding of the court upon this point sustained by the evidence. Brownson v. Scanlan, 59 Texas, 226.
Appellants also contend that the description of the land in the deed from the administrator of Grover to Tarver is not sufficient under the five years statute. The description in this deed is as follows. “Two hundred acres of land in Hill County, Texas, lying about six miles northeast from Hillsboro, and located by virtue of part of M. B. Atkinson 320 acres certificate.” By the other evidence in the record it is made plain that this comprised the whole of the survey at that place, and the deed did not refer to 200 acres to be taken out of a larger tract. In Flanagan v. Boggess, 46 Texas, 335, the following description in a tax deed was held sufficient as a basis for prescription under the five years statute, to-wit: “Six hundred and twenty acres of the headright of David Brown, situate about twelve miles north of Henderson, in the neighborhood of Bellview.” We think the reasoning of the court in holding this description good in that case has peculiar application to this, and we therefore hold the deed sufficient.
Appellees have also filed cross-assignments calling in question the sufficiency of appellants’ title to entitle them to judgment, even though the defense of limitation should fail.
Their first contention is, that the evidence shows the location of the Atkinson certificate to be older than the Shackelford, upon which appellants’ patent was issued, and that the Commissioner of the General Land Office was in error in holding that certificate and location invalid. It will be noticed that appellees in no way connect themselves with the Atkinson location, and only seek to avail themselves of it as an outstanding-title.
Delivered October 25, 1892.
It has long been settled in this State that an outstanding equity will not avail a stranger thereto in defense against the legal title. Shields v. Hunt, 45 Texas, 424; Gullett v. O’Connor, 54 Texas, 416. The last case cited is peculiarly in point and conclusive in holding that even though it be conceded that the Atkinson location was valid and prior in time to the Shackelford, it would not avail appellees in defense against the legal title evidenced by the patent issued upon the latter.
The second contention of appellees in their attack upon the title of appellants is, that the corrected field notes on the Shackelford location returned to the Land Office in 1887 was not a correction, but a relocation, and was therefore upon a certificate barred by the Constitution. All of the land embraced in the last field notes was included in the survey made in 1874, and we are of opinion that they were properly treated as corrections and not as relocations. Railway v. Thompson, 65 Texas, 190. At any rate it was necessary for the Commissioner to decide as to whether this was a legitimate correction before he issued the patent thereon; and even if it be conceded that he made an erroneous ruling as to this, it would not make the patent void, but at most it would only be voidable when attacked by the proper parties, and it could not be taken advantage of by appellees, who are strangers to both locations. Gullett v. O’Connor, 54 Texas, 416; League v. Rogan, 59 Texas, 430; Decourt v. Sproul, 66 Texas, 368.
The appellee A. M. Allen having filed a plea of not guilty as to all of the land sued for, and not having offered any evidence of title, and the court having found that appellants had the legal paper title to all of the land sued for by them, judgment should have been rendered in their favor against said Allen, and it will be so rendered here.
Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that judgment should here be rendered affirming the judgment below in favor of appellee Z. T. Huff as to the 19.8 acres conveyed to him by G. T. Tarver, July 24, 1882; that the judgment in favor of appellee A. M. Allen should be reversed and here rendered in favor of appellants against said Allen as to all the land sued for by them; that the judgment below in favor of appellee Kirkpatrick, and in favor of appellee Huff as to the 27.6 acres conveyed to him by McKinnon & Call, April 21, 1883, should be reversed and remanded for a new trial.
Reversed and remanded.
Chief Justice Tarlton did not sit in this case."
219198,The Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. Louisa Roberts et al.,1893-01-10,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This appeal is from a verdict and judgment in favor of the surving wife and children of Newton R. Roberts, who was killed on the 24th of November, 1888, by one of appellant’s •north bound passenger trains, within the corporate limits of Queen City, in Cass County, about 125 yards south of a public crossing, on or near a pathway usually travelled by footmen, and sometimes by persons on horseback, which ran diagonally across appellant’s railway track. The evidence tended to show that deceased had entered upon the track at the public crossing, which was a wagon road, and had gone down the track, riding a mule, to about the place where he was killed. That this occurred about fifteen minutes before the train was in sight, and that the homicide occurred about thirty minutes after sundown. At this point the railway 'track was on an embankment about 10 or 12 feet high, and the deceased, when killed and for several minutes before the train was in sight, was engaged in trying, in vain, to lead his mule off the track and down the embankment, and seems to have been entirely unconscious of the approaching train. The evidence tended to show that the track was straight for several hundred yards south of this point, and that in approaching, deceased the train was running up grade, and the witnesses vary in their estimates of its rate of speed from 15 to 35 miles per hour.
The deceased seems to have been on his way from Queen City to Atlanta, a distance of two or three miles; and the evidence was conflicting •as to whether or not he was drunk at the time of the homicide. It was .also conflicting as to the distance he could have been seen by the engineer just before he was killed; the train men claiming that they did not see him and could not have seen him at a greater distance than 150 feet on account of the darkness, other eye-witnesses testifying that he could have been seen as much as 400 yards away. There was also a conflict as to the time when the bell rang and the whistle blew; one witness testifying that it occurred at the very time of the killing, others testifying that it occurred when the train was from 35 to 175 yards distant. There was also a planing mill 30 or 40 yards east of the place of the accident, though there were no other houses nearer than about 200 yards.
The evidence was conflicting as to the distance the train was from the deceased when he was first discovered by the train men, varying from 35 to 175 yards, and was susceptible of different constructions as to the time the air brakes were applied. The proof tended to show that the train, if running at 35 miles per hour, could have been stopped within 400 feet, and within about half that distance if running at 15 or 20 miles per hour. Deceased appears to have had a life expectancy of 21 years; to have been .a prosperous farmer, ginner, and trader, and to have contributed about $1000 annually to the support of his family. The amount of the verdict was $10,000.
Appellees charged the train operatives with negligence; to which appellant replied with a general denial and a plea of contributory negligence.
By the eighth assignment of error, appellant complains of the eleventh paragraph of the court’s charge, which is as follows:
“ If you believe from the evidence that Newton R. Roberts voluntarily placed himself on defendant company’s railway track, and you further find that those in charge of defendant’s engine saw the said Roberts on the track before it reached him, but failed to ring the bell or blow the whistle as soon as they saw him, in order to warn said Roberts of the approach of said train, then the defendant would be guilty of negligence; and if you further find that by reason of such negligence on the part of the defendant’s employes, said Roberts was struck by such engine or train and killed, then the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover.”
We are of opinion that this charge contains error. It seems to be well settled in this State, that negligence is a question of fact for the jury, and that the court is not warranted in instructing them that the failure of the train operatives to ring the bell or blow the whistle as soon as they see a man on the track, in order to warn him of the approach of the train, would constitute negligence. Calhoun v. Railway, 84 Texas, 226; Railway v. Lee, 70 Texas, 501; Railway v. Anderson, 76 Texas, 249; Railwaw v. Dyer, 76 Texas, 160.
In Calhoun’s case, above cited, it is said: “ The court has the right to instruct the jury that it is the duty of the operatives of the engine in approaching a public crossing to ring the bell or blow the whistle; but it is a charge upon the weight of the evidence if it instructs them that to perform or the failure to perform this duty shall be given a certain effect.” As this error in the charge will require a reversal of the judgment, in view of another trial, we invite the attention of the trial court to the authorities cited above with reference to other portions of the charge of which both appellant and appellees might, under these decisions, we think, justly complain, and of which, in the sixth assignment, appellant does in part complain; these cases having been reported since the trial below.
The ninth assignment of error calls in question the twelfth paragraph of the charge, which reads as follows:
“If you believe from the evidence that the said Newton R. Roberts voluntarily placed himself on the defendant’s railway track, and you further believe from the evidence that at said time and place he was struck and killed by one of defendant company’s engines or trains, but you further believe that those in charge of the defendant’s engine and train exercised proper care in looking to see whether or not its track was clear, and that those in charge of the train saw the said Roberts on or near the track in front of the train, or could have seen him by diligently looking out in front of the train, in time to ring the bell or blow the whistle in order to give him warning of the approach of the train, and that they did ring the bell and blow the whistle in time for Roberts to have heard it and get off the track, then those in charge of said train would have had the right to presume that he would get off the track; and if you so find, then the plaintiffs can not recover, unless you believe those in charge of defendant company’s engine and train rang the bell and blew the whistle, and saw that said Roberts was not going to get off the track before it reached him, or could have ascertained that he was not going to get off the track by the exercise of due care and caution, in time to stop the train before it reached him, and failed to do so.”
While we do not think the objection as urged to this charge by appellant’s assignment would require a reversal of the judgment, still we are of opinion that it is objectionable as not containing a clear and correct statement of the law as applicable to the facts of this case; at least, we think the jury might easily have misunderstood what was doubtless intended to be expressed. The court evidently had in mind the doctrine of discovered negligence; and if, as some of the language might seem to imply, it was intended to state that though the perilous position of deceased resulted from his own negligence, appellant would still be liable for the failure of its train men to discover this peril by keeping a proper lookout, the charge was incorrect.
Where a person goes upon a railway track, and is at the time of the collision, by his own negligence, placed in a dangerous position, he is not entitled to recover damages resulting from the injuries received on account of the failure of the train operatives to discover his position of peril in time to avoid the accident. In such case, his contributory negligence precludes a recovery, unless it also appears that after his position of danger is discovered, the operatives are guilty of negligence contributing to the injury. Where, however, at the time of the collision he is not guilty of negligence, though originally negligent in going upon the track, an intervening cause absolutely or perhaps morally beyond his control having but him in a position of peril, it seems that the railway would be guilty of actionable negligence, if through the want of proper care its train men should fail to discover the dangerous position of the person on the track in time to avert the injury. Railway v. Ryon, 70 Texas, 56; Railway v. Symkins, 54 Texas, 615; Wasmer v. Railway, 1 Am. and Eng. Ry. Cases, 132.
It may be doubted, also, whether the court should have instructed the jury, that the train operatives upon ringing the bell and sounding the whistle could presume that the deceased would clear the track in time to escape injury. He seems to have been actively engaged for sometime prior to the appearance of the train, and up to the very moment of the collision, in an earnest effort to induce his mule—an animal whose restive disposition is common knowledge—to quit the track. As to whether railway operatives may presume that a person upon the track will leave it,, depends upon the facts of each particular case.
The other assignments complaining of charges given and refused are not well taken, unless it be the sixth assignment, to which reference has already been incidentally made. The remaining assignments, relating to the verdict of the jury, need not be considered.
It follows that the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered January 10, 1893."
216227,"J. P. Smith et al. v. J. W. Wilson and Boatman Savings Bank, for use of F. M. Dougherty",1892-10-25,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This appeal is prosecuted by J. F. Smith, J. D. Reed, and E. G-. Thurmond, from a verdict and judgment rendered in the District Court of Cooke County, on the 22nd day of November, 1889, in favor of F. M. Dougherty, in the sum of $3257.72, reviving to that extent and for the use and benefit of said Dougherty two certain judgments against appellants, the one in favor of the Boatman Savings Bank and the other in favor of J. W. Wilson, which judgments so revived were rendered in the District Court of Cooke County in the year 1885, in the aggregate sum of about $16,000.
In the year 1885 the Boatman Savings Bank recovered a judgment in the District Court of Cooke County against J. W. Dabbs & Co., and Fore, Morphy & Henderson, as principals, and the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, R. S. Rollins, and others, as endorsers, in the sum of twenty thousand and some hundred dollars. Fore, Morphy & Henderson delivered to said Rollins, in order to protect said cattle company and Rollins and others as endorsers, two certain notes, executed by appellants, upon which the judgments sought to be revived by this suit were rendered. These notes were to be collected and the proceeds applied to the payment of said original judgment in favor of the Boatman Savings Bank, and were after-wards placed in judgments by the attorneys for said Boatman Savings Bank, under the direction of said Rollins; the one in the name of said bank, and the other, for convenience, in the name of J. W. Wilson, who was president of said cattle company. After these judgments were all obtained, in the latter part of the year 1885 said cattle company became insolvent. On the 2nd day of March, 1886, said cattle company; through J. W. Wilson, its president, assigned the two judgments sought to be revived in this suit to F. M. Dougherty, who was president of the First National Bank of Gainesville. It is alleged in the pleadings both of appellants and appellees that at that date said judgments were owned by said cattle company, though subject to the rights of said Boatman Savings Bank. Under said original judgment in favor of the Boatman Savings Bank, in the months of February, March, and June, 1886, certain lands of said cattle company were sold at execution sale and the proceeds applied as credits upon said original judgment. The sales in February and March reduced the amount due on the same to about $8000, and the June sale to about $6000. The collateral judgments were allowed to become dormant. When the cattle company became insolvent it was indebted to the First National Bank of Gainesville, by note, in the sum of about $18,000, which was secured by mortgage on cattle to the extent of about $16,000. In the month of January or February, 1886, appellant Smith undertook to procure at a discount debts against the insolvent cattle company in amount sufficient to offset the two collateral judgments, and engaged one Hulen, a director in the cattle company, to assist him, or to procure them for him, agreeing to pay him one-half of what Smith might save in offsetting said judgments. He succeeded in obtaining for Smith four notes against the cattle company; one in February, 1886, called the McAdams note, for about $10,000, less a credit of some $3000; the other three in May, 1886, called the McCubbins and Rolls notes, for less amounts, the purchase being made on the 20th and the purchase price paid on the 28th of May. The McAdams note and the balance due on the original Boatman Savings Bank judgment were allowed in the court below as offsets, and the other notes were rejected. Hulen procured one Sacra, vice president of said cattle company, to assist him in obtaining said notes for Smith, which he did to the extent of giving information as to where and how to find them — Hulen agreeing to pay him one-half the profit or compensation coining to him under the arrangement with Smith.
In September, 1886, at the request of Hulen, Smith paid one-half of the sum promised Hulen- to Sacra; and the proof tended to show that prior to this time Smith had no knowledge of the employment of Sacra by Hulen. The proof failed to show that either Smith or Hulen had actual knowledge of the transfer of the judgments to Dougherty until after the offsets had been acquired, though Sacra did have such knowledge at the time of the transfer. The record discloses that some, if not all, of the notes pleaded as offsets were placed in the hands of W. O. Davis, Esq., by Smith and Hulen, in February, 1886, and that the McCubbins and Rolls notes were on the 20th day of May, as well as prior thereto, in some wajr pledged as collateral security to R. S. Rollins, vice president of said First National Bank of Gainesville, and J. M. Lindsay, an officer of Gainesville National Bank, to secure to said two banks debts due to them severally.
A judgment was obtained in the District Court of Cooke County against said cattle company in favor of R. S. Rollins on the 22nd day of December, 188». for about $30,000, based upon two certain notes payable to Wilson & Ilearne, signed by J. W. Wilson as president of said cattle company, and John H. Stone, secretary, endorsed by I-Iearne to J. W. Wilson and by Wilson to Rollins; and said judgment was on said 2nd day of March, 1886, assigned by Rollins to Dougherty. On the same day said F. M. Dougherty, through J. H. Garnett, Esq., law partner of W. 0. Davis, caused a writ of garnishment to issue against appellants, and contemporaneously therewith said Wilson, at the suggestion of said Garnett, made the assignment of said other judgment as above stated.
There is much diversity disclosed in the record among the witnesses with reference to the ownership, history, use, and purpose of this $30,000 judgment. The record discloses that J. W. Wilson was indebted to Dougherty individually in the sum of about $10,000. On the 20th of May, 1886, when the rejected offsets were purchased by Smith, there were present in the office of Davis & Garnett, Messrs. Garnett, Smith, Hulen, and Rollins, there being a conflict in the evidence as to whether or not Sacra was there. At this meeting Smith paid balance due on, and obtained assignment of, the original judgment in favor of the Boatman Savings Bank. Nothing was said about the assignment of the collateral judgments against appellants at this meeting, and Smith seems to have been ignorant of that fact, and perhaps also Hulen, though the fact was known to Rollins, who was vice president of said First National Bank, and who was released by Smith as endorser on said original judgment, in which matter lie appears to have been acting for himself; but in the matter of the sale of said notes to be used as offsets he seems to have acted in behalf of said First National Bank, of which he was an officer, though not actively engaged in its service, the money realized from the sale of said notes to Smith being in part paid to said bank by him. He states that Smith, or Hulen in Smith’s presence, then and there agreed to pay the balance due on said First National Bank debt after the cattle mortgaged to it should be applied thereto, there being an estimated balance of $1800 or $2000, and that he would not have acted as he did in selling said offsets but for this promise on Smith’s or Hulen’s part. Smith and Hulen state that the promise was conditioned upon the Wichita sale reducing the amount due Smith on the original judgment to such an extent as to leave a balance of $1800 or $2000 due on the collateral judgments, after applying all offsets. It is also disclosed that the first notice that Garnett had of the notes being left with his partner was on the 2nd day of March, 1886, just after he drew up the garnishment papers, and that he did not inform Davis of the existence of the assignment of the judgments, and that this fact was not present to his mind until recalled, long after this transaction.
The evidence as to the purpose of the assignment of the judgments sought to be revived tends to different conclusions. The theory of appellees, which lias support in the record, is that these judgments were assigned for the purpose of securing the $18,000 debt due the First National Bank. There is some evidence tending to show that they ma)r have been assigned to secure the $30,000 Rollins judgment, or, in part, the debt of J. W. Wilson.
On the 8th of April, 1888, appellee Dougherty, through his attorneys, filed an application for scire facias to revive the two judgments herein. After the two writs were served on appellants the causes were on their motion, at the April term, 1889, consolidated; at which term of the court there was a trial of this cause without any exceptions having been taken to the form of said application or scire facias. A new trial being granted at the November term of said year, appellants, for the first time, filed exceptions to the form of said application and scire facias, which were overruled and exceptions reserved.
The first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error complain of the action of the court in overruling appellants’ special exceptions to the scire facias and application therefor upon which this suit is founded.
These exceptions relate to the form of the pleadings complained of, and we are of opinion that the court did not err in overruling them; they came too late after there had been a trial and continuance of the cause at the former term without any objection having been made to said scire facias and application.
The fifth assignment complains of the action of the court in permitting certain allegations of fraud and conspiracy in the supplemental pleadings of appellee to be read to the jury after the exceptions of appellants had been sustained thereto. We think this practice is not to be commended; but, under the circumstances disclosed' in the record, no reversible error was committed.
The sixth and seventh assignments complain of the admission in evidence of the assignment of the two judgments sought to be revived in this suit, because it was not alleged and shown that J. W. Wilson had any interest in or authority to transfer the judgment in the name of the Boatman Savings Bank, or that the Boatman Savings Bank was not the owner thereof, because the transfer of the other judgment to Dougherty was made subject to the rights of the Boatman Savings Bank and it was not shown that it had parted with its interest in said judgment. These judgments and the assignments thereof were sufficiently identified by the scire facias to admit them in evidence, and we are of opinion that the objections raised related rather to their effect than to their admissibility, and tha-t the court did not err in this respect.
The tenth assignment complains of the exclusion from the jury of certain testimony which witness W. O. Davis proposed to give in response to a question propounded to him by appellants. After he had testified that J. P. Smith called at his office and left with him the notes relied upon as offsets in this case, or at least some of them, he ivas asked by appellants’ counsel to state for Avhat purpose J. P. Smith left the notes with him; and having answered that he did not know except from what J. P. Smith said at the time of leaving the notes, the appellants’ counsel then asked him to state what Smith said when he left the notes as to his object or purpose in leaving them, expecting to prove that Smith said he left said notes for safe keeping only and to be held by Davis until Smith should call for them. This testimony was objected to by appellee, because, first, Smith could not make evidence for himself; second, the witness had no right to detail a conversation with his client, and because said conversation was hearsay.
» As this transaction occurred prior to the date of the transfer to the appellee of the judgment sought to be revived, we are unable to see how the statement by Smith could be deemed in any sense a self-serving declaration. The second objection, that he could not detail a conversation Avitli his client, is equally untenable, because a confidential communication is the privilege of the client, and not of his antagonist in litigation. It is equally clear that the testimony was not hearsay, but a verbal act coming clearly within the meaning of the rule on that subject. It was contemporaneous with the main fact under consideration and was so connected with it as to illustrate its character. See Greenl. Ev., sec. 108. Appellee in his brief seeks to sustain this ruling on the ground that Smith and Hulen had both been on the stand and testified. We fail to find in their evidence any statement of Smith’s purpose in lodging these notes with Davis. If they had testified at the trial that the purpose was to leave them for safe keeping, it seems to us that it would have been admissible to eorrobarate their evidence by the declaration made at the very time the notes were deposited.
After a careful consideration of the complex issues disclosed in this record, Ave are unable to say that this error on the part of the court was not prejudicial to the rights of appellants. It became a material inquiry whether the knowledge on the part of Garnett of the transfer of the judgments in controversy should be imputed to Smith, on account of the alleged relationship of attorney and client between Davis and Garnett on the one hand and Smith on the other. Two theories were raised by the evidence and submitted by the court in his charge to the jury; the one that the relationship of attorney and client had been so established when the notes pleaded as offsets were placed in the hands of Davis; and the other, that they were not placed there to create or in virtue of said relationship, but for safe keeping only.
The fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, twenty-third, and thirty-second assignments of error complain of charges given and refused upon the theory that this relation of attorney and client would, under the circumstances disclosed in the record, make Smith chargeable with the knowledge of Garnett.
We are of opinion that if this relation was created, and the scope of employment contemplated that they would act for Smith in asserting offsets against said judgments assigned to Dougherty, notice at the proper time to either Davis or Garnett would be binding upon Smith, and hence we think that these assignments are not well taken.
The twentieth and twenty-first assignments complain of the refusal of the court to give the second and third requested instructions. We are not prepared to say that it was error to refuse said second instruction, but are of opinion that the third instruction was applicable to one theory of the case, and should have been given. It is as follows:'
“ Third. If you believe from the evidence that the said judgment in favor of Rollins was in fact owned by J.W. Wilson, on the 2nd of March, 1886, and that said Wilson, acting for said Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, transferred the two judgments sought to be revived to secure said judgment in the name of R. S. Rollins, you will find for the defendants, unless you believe from the evidence that said company, with knowledge of all the facts, has since ratified said transfer.”
The latter part of this requested instruction on the subject of ratification seems to us to add nothing to its force or value, and need not have been given. There was a conflict of evidence as to the ownership of the $30,000 judgment, obtained in the name of Rollins, and there was also some evidence tending to show that the judgments sought to be revived may have been assigned to secure the Rollins judgment; we think appellants were entitled to have their theory of the evidence submitted to the jury to disprove the case alleged by appellees.
By the eighteenth assignment complaint is made of the following charge, as quoted in appellants’ brief:
“ If R. S. Rollins was vice president and director of the First National Bank, and knew of the transfer to Dougherty from Wilson, and knew that Smith did not know of such transfer; and if said Rollins was present when J. P. Smith purchased or paid for the notes claimed as offsets herein, and, was engaged at said time in his character as officer and director in transacting the business of the said bank, and did not disclose to Smith his knowledge, if any, of said transfer, then said offsets would be valid credits against the judgment herein sought to be revived; but if said Rollins was present at said purchase, transacting his own business, then his failure to disclose to Smith any knowledge of the transfer to Dougherty, if he had such knowledge, would not affect the right of said bank in this case.”
Appellants requested charges upon that subject, and assigned errors upon the refusal to give them. We are of opinion that the evidence tended to prove that Rollins acted in a dual capacity at the meeting of May 20, 1886. In so far as lie sought to be relieved as endorser upon the original Boatman Savings Bank judgment, he was acting for himself; but in the matter of the sale of the offsets to Smith, a part of the purchase money for which he turned over to the First National Bank, he was acting in behalf of said bank; and that the charge should have submitted to the jury the theory of this dual capacity, or rather that if he was acting in behalf of the bank, and at the same time acting in his own interest, his acts would be binding upon the bank.
The charge copied in the transcript contains, after the words 11 transacting his own business,” the following, “ or was not in pursuance of his authority transacting the business of the bank, then,” etc. While we think the use of “and” instead of “or” would have more clearly expressed the theory above indicated, we are of opinion that the jury probably understood the charge to mean what was doubtless intended to be expressed, and hence this assignment is not well taken. It may be that the court should have also submitted in connection with said charge some appropriate instruction, presenting the theory, as claimed by Rollins, that at the meeting on the 20th of May, 1886, said Smith promised to pay the balance due on the bank debt, and that but for this promise he would not have acted as he did; but this is a matter of which the appellants could not complain.
The proposition asserted by appellants in their nineteenth assignment, to the effect that the court should have charged that the insolvency of the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company prevented any preference of its creditors by its president, and therefore rendered invalid the assignment of said judgments to Dougherty, could not avail them in this suit, for the obvious reason that they do not seek an equitable distribution of its assets, but are striving earnestly to secure a preference over other creditors by offsetting the only valuable judgments owned by said company as assets with its greatly depreciated if not worthless paper at its face value. Lang v. Dougherty, 74 Texas, 226.
The thirty-fifth assignment, by which complaint is made that the court should have charged to find for defendants, because the proof showed that the judgments sought to be revived were owned by the Boatman Savings Bank as collateral security, and the debt for which they were pledged was owned by defendant Smith, and plaintiff had not redeemed or offered to redeem said collateral securities, is equally untenable. Appellants, under the facts disclosed in this record, can not invoke this principle.
The seventeenth assignment is as follows: “That portion of the fifth clause of the charge to the effect, that if II. T-Iulen employed J. W. Sacra to assist in buying the offsets, and that if the amount to be paid by Smith for the service was to be shared between them, and that this fact was known to J. P. Smith or assented to by him, or, if not known to him, was afterward ratified or recognized by Smith, then Smith would be charged with and affected by the notice of Sacra, was erroneous and calculated to mislead.”
Delivered October 25, 1892.
This assignment presents to us the question of greatest difficulty in the case. It is assumed by the parties to this litigation that the transaction between Smith and I-Iulen established the relation of principal and agent between them. It is contended by appellee that the transaction between Hulen and Sacra, coupled with the fact that Smith paid to Sacra, at the instance of Hulen, one-half of the sum of money he had agreed to pay Hulen, rendered Sacra also the agent of Smith, and hence that the knowledge on Sacra’s part of the assignment of the judgments sought to be revived should be imputed to Smith, though he had acquired title to the offsets prior to his knowledge of the fact that Sacra was in any way interested with Hulen in the matter. He relies upon the principle, which is well sustained by authority, that if one without authority assumes to act as the agent of another, and the latter takes the benefit of the unauthorized act by claiming rights under it or otherwise ratifying it, he must take such benefit charged with notice of such matters as appear to have been within the knowledge of the unauthorized agent at the time of the transaction. On the other hand, it is contended that the doctrine, which is also sustained by authority, that if the subagent be the agent of the agent merely, then there is no privity between him and the principal, and his knowledge can not be imputed to the principal, is applicable to the facts of this case. We have been cited to no case directly in point; and as the tendency of modern decisions is rather toward a restriction than an extension of the doctrine of implied or constructive notice in respect to agency, we are of opinion that the charge, in so far as it instructed the jury on the subject of ratification and notice as a result therefrom, was not applicable to the facts of this case. It seems to us, that when Smith purchased and paid for the notes in ignorance, as claimed by him, of the connection of Sacra with the matter, his rights were fixed and should not be prejudiced by the fact that afterward, upon the request of Hulen, he paid to Sacra one-half the sum he had agreed to pay Hulen under the contract with him.
The. other assignments, we think, are not well taken.
For the errors indicated above, the judgment will be reversed and the cause íemanded for a new trial.
Reversed and remanded.
A motion for rehearing was overruled in this case."
219133,R. A. Black v. E. G. Caviness and E. E. Patterson,1893-01-10,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
In the summer of 1886, plaintiff in error, R. A. Black, and one J. D. Cock, entered into a verbal agreement to purchase together a certain tract of land situated in Lamar County. In pursuance of this agreement the deed was taken in the name of Cock, but the purchase was understood to be for their mutual benefit. The purchase price of the land was $300, of which $50 was borrowed on their joint note, and paid as the money of Black. After the execution of the deed to Cock, he borrowed, with the consent of Black, from E. G. Caviness, in the month of September, 1886, $300, secured by a deed of trust on the land, out of which money so borrowed the $50 note was paid off, together with the rest of the purchase money.
In December following, the land was conveyed by Cock, without the knowledge or consent of Black, to Caviness, in satisfaction of this $300 loan, then not due.
Prior to this, said Cock and Black agreed to sell to E. E. Patterson the tract of land in consideration of his paying the $300 note on the 1st day of January, 1887 (the date of its maturity), and executing his own note for $300 additional, payable one year from that date; out of which transactions Cock seems to have made a profit to the amount of 37-¡- bushels of corn, exacted by him of Patterson as an additional consideration for the sale. Patterson failed to raise the money prior to the conveyance of the land to Caviness, and the latter afterward sold and conveyed the same to the former for the same price and on the same terms as he agreed to do when Cock conveyed to him.
The evidence is conflicting as to whether at the date of the conveyanceirom Cock to Caviness the latter had notice of the interest or claim of Black. The court, in the third finding of fact, found that Caviness had no such notice of any interest or claim of Black, and there is evidence to sustain this conclusion.
After the $300 note executed by Patterson matured, suit was brought thereon by Caviness to foreclose the vendor’s lien on the land. R. A. Black intervened in this suit, claiming that he had been defrauded, and that he was entitled to half the amount to be collected on said note as against' Caviness, the plainiiff in said suit, and that the same should be paid him on foreclosure of the vendor’s lien, praying in addition for general relief; and failing to recover, he prosecutes this writ of error. The court’s conclusions of fact are all sustained by the statement of facts.
Between plaintiff and defendant an agreed judgment was entered, by which plaintiff’s suit was dismissed.
Our construction of the transactions disclosed in the foregoing conclusions of fact leads to the following conclusions of law:
1. The conveyance to J. D. Cock made him a trustee for R. A. Black, to the extent of a half-interest in the land in controversy, subject to the encumbrance created by the deed of trust.
2. Inasmuch as Caviness paid no new consideration, but accepted am absolute conveyance from Cock in satisfaction of his pre-existing debt, he was substituted to Cock’s position as trustee for Black, though he accepted said deed without notice of the interest of Black.
3. By the sale and conveyance to Patterson by Caviness, the former succeeded to the position of trustee to the extent of a half-interest in the-land for the benefit of Black, subject to the satisfaction by the latter of his proportionate part of the encumbrance removed from the title by the-payment of the amount originally secured by the deed of trust.
These conclusions are supported by the following propositions and authorities:
1. Under the facts found, Cock and his assigns became trustees by construction of law to the extent of Black’s interest in the land; or at least between Cock and Black an express trust was created (which may be shown by paroi in this State). Clark v. Haney, 62 Texas, 511; Hudson v. Wilkinson, 45 Texas, 444; Bailey v. Harris, 19 Texas, 109.
•2. A purchaser from a trustee without notice of the trust, where the sole consideration is the payment of a pre-existing debt, takes the property subject to the trust. Everett v. Railway, 67 Texas, 430; 1 Perry on Trusts, secs. 217, 241; McKamey v. Thorp, 61 Texas, 652; Overstreet v. Manning, 67 Texas, 660.
In McKamey v. Thorp, above cited, it was decided, in accordance with the great weight of American authority, that a creditor who buys from his debtor, and pays the consideration money by merely crediting the amount upon a pre-existing debt, is not a bona fide purchaser for value. Chief Justice Willie, however, in commenting on the statement in Wallace v. Campbell 54 Texas, 90, that such a purchase might be bona fide when a previous judgment or execution lien had been secured upon the property sold, uses this language: “It may also be remarked, that in such case a purchaser surrenders an existing security, viz., the previous lien of his judgment or execution, and this is held equivalent to the payment of a valuable consideration,” Citing Love v. Taylor, 26 Miss., 574, and Padgett v. Lawrence, 10 Paige Ch., 179.
As this remark of the learned chief justice, though in substance repeated in a subsequent part of the opinion, was merely by way of illustration or comment, and not essential to the determination of the question involved in that case, it is not believed to be binding on us as authority, especially after examining the cases cited in its support. The first case cited is from Mississippi, where the general American rule followed in this State, as decided in McKamey v. Thorp, and reaffirmed in Overstreet v. Manning, does not prevail, it having been expressly decided by the Supreme Court of that State, in the subsequent case of Soule v. Shotwell, 52 Mississippi, 236, that the payment and extinguishment of an antecedent debt, in consideration of a simultaneous transfer of property, constituted the vendee a purchaser for value to the same extent as-if he had paid the money; citing the above case of Love v. Taylor, 26 Mississippi, 574.
In McKamey v. Thorp, commercial paper taken in due course of trade is recognized as an exception to the general American rule, as is well settled by a long line of decisions in and out of this State, following Swift v. Tyson, 16 Peters, 1-24; and yet the decision in Love v. Taylor was rested upon the ground that no reason was perceived why the rule in regard to negotiable securities was not applicable to the purchase of lands.
In the other case cited, the property purchased seems to have been taken in payment and satisfaction of a debt secured by a judgment lien on other property. If the satisfaction of a mortgage on the identical property conveyed to the purchaser, as in this case, should be deemed a new consideration, it would seem that for the same reason the satisfaction of an unsecured debt should have like effect. On this point see West v. Naylor, 93 Indiana, 431, though on the main question the courts of Indiana seem to follow the rule adopted in Mississippi.
We can not perceive how an absolute deed to Caviness could place him in a worse position than when he held only a mortgage on the property. If the transaction was not to his disadvantage in its results, we think he should not be permitted to avail himself of the equity of an innocent purchaser to deprive Black of a profit which he otherwise might have made.
We are therefore of opinion that if plaintiff in error was willing to accept in satisfaction of his interest in the land one-half the amount of the profit derived by Caviness from the sale to Patterson, as represented in the $300 note of the latter, that defendant in error should not be heard to deny him that relief. Wiseman v. Baylor, 69 Texas, 63.
We think plaintiff in error should be permitted to choose between this relief and the assertion of his interest in the land.
It follows that the judgment must be reversed, and we think the cause' should be remanded for a new trial, and it is so ordered.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered January 10, 1893."
219047,The Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. J. W. and N. A. King,1893-01-10,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This appeal is from a verdict for $1100, divided equally between appellees, the father and mother of Ed. C. King, who was killed in the summer of 1888, while working in appellant’s yard at Greenville, by being crushed between the cars he was-coupling.' He was, at the time of his death, about. 19 years of age, and had been in the employment of appellant about six weeks. He was first regularly employed as freight brakeman on the road, but about three days before his death was put to work in the yard. He was killed in an attempt to couple a Miller hook to an ordinary drawhead, occasioned by their passing each other. The proof tended to show that work in the yard was more hazardous than on the road; and also that the coupling of a Miller hook to an ordinary drawhead was extra hazardous, because they were not made for each other, and were liable to pass and crush the brakeman. There was also some evidence of defects in the Miller hook, though it did not distinctly appear that these defects caused the accident. The proof tended to show, that the deceased was inexperienced in this kind of work, and that this fact, together with his minority, was known to the servants and agents of appellant who had power to employ him, and who put him to work in the yard and directed the manner of his service. The proof tended to show, that J. B. Turentine, yard foreman, who put deceased to work in the yard, warned him that the service there was more hazardous than on the road, and that he explained (in what manner and to what extent the proof does not show) the danger of coupling the Miller hook with the ordinary drawhead. It does appear from his testimony that he could not state that he informed the deceased that the Miller hook and drawhead would pass each other. The proof also tended to-show, that the Miller hook in question was the only one then in use by appellant in its Greenville yard on its standard gouge cars, it being on one of its passenger coaches. There was evidence that deceased had been employed in railroad service against the consent of his father.
We conclude that the record contains evidence from which it may be inferred that deceased came to his death through the negligence of appellant, without contributory negligence on his part, and that it"" did not result from the ordinary risks assumed.
The first, second, third, and fifth assignments of error question the correctness of the trial court’s rulings in admitting evidence to show that ■appellant had knowledge of the minority of the deceased. It is undisputed that A. L. Downer, who was station agent and acting yardmaster for appellant, with power to employ and discharge brakemen and switch-men, and whose business it was to employ yardmen, had knowledge at the time the deceased was employed and injured both of his minority and inexperience. J. B. Turentine, yard foreman, believing and having reason to believe that the deceased was a minor, put him to work in the yard, with the consent and sanction of Downer. If there was error therefore in the admission of any of this evidence for the purpose of bringing knowledge to Ed. Stall, train dispatcher, who first employed deceased as brakeman on the road, or for the purpose of charging appellant with knowledge through any other agent or servant, the error was harmless, because, at least through Downer and Turentine, appellant is shown to have had knowledge of this fact.
The sixth, seventh, and eighth assignments of error complain of the refusal of the court below to give the first, second, third, and seventh special charges requested by appellant. In refusing these charges the judge states, among other things, that they were refused because not separately submitted. The first, second, and third seem to have been written upon a sheet of paper which contained also three other special charges, all consecutively numbered. The seventh requested charge was likewise accompanied by a separate requested instruction, numbered eighth. We think the court did not err in refusing to give these instructions for the reasons stated in connection with his endorsement of refusal.
The eighth assignment of error complains of the court’s third charge. The proposition submitted under this assignment is this:
“ If the servant at the time he is injured knows of the hazard attending the act, he can not recover, no matter how he came by such knowledge. It is not necessary ""that he should receive the knowledge by a special warning from the master.”
This paragraph of the charge was qualified with the statement, in effect, that if the jury found that Ed. King was inexperienced in such duties, and did not know of the danger or peril attendant upon the performance of such duties, and that defendant knew of his want of experience and his ignorance, and that the injury was not caused by the fault or contributory negligence of Ed. King, the jury might find for plaintiff, provided they found the facts constituting negligence on the part of the defendant to exist. We conclude therefore that this assignment, as interpreted by the proposition under it, is not well taken. No further complaint is made of the charge, and the only remaining assignment questions the sufficiency - of the evidence to sustain the verdict.
We are of opinion, that the issues were clearly and fairly submitted to the jury by the charge, and that there is evidence to support the verdict.There is therefore nothing left us but to affirm the judgment, and it is so ordered.
Affirmed.
Delivered January 10, 1893."
216261,William Cassin v. La Salle County,1892-10-25,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This appeal is prosecuted by Willliam Cassin from a judgment rendered in the District Court of Martin County against him, in favor of La Salle County, on the 18th day of September, 1889, for the recovery of the four leagues of school land set apart to La Salle County under the Constitution and laws of this State. The case was tried without a jury, and is brought here on conclusions of law and fact, accompanied by a statement of facts.
The conclusions of fact filed in the court below are here referred to and adopted as our conclusions of fact, except the sixth and eighth conclusions, which are not approved.
The record discloses that in 1883 appellant made a written proposition to the Commissioners Court of La Salle County, by which he agreed to furnish vacancies for the location of these four leagues of school land, and to locate the same, paying all the necessary charges in any way con-, nected with the locating and patenting of the same, and to pay the county for the lands located by him 30 cents per acre on ten years time at 7 per cent interest per annum, payable semi-annually, from the date of his proposition, which was August 14,1883, only however binding himself to take or purchase 8856 acres, with the privilege of the rest. This proposition was accepted by the Commissioners Court; and thereafter, in October of the same year, he made a further proposition in writing, stating that in the previous proposition he had contracted with the Commissioners Court to purchase the four leagues of land after being located at his expense, and that since making that contract he had reason to believe that he could get four leagues for the county set apart out of the land reserved for unorganized counties, etc., and proposed, in the event he so succeeded, to agree to pay $1000 additional, to be added to the price per acre stipulated in the August contract, to be paid in accordance with the terms of. said August contract; and that in consideration of said $1000 the County Commissioners Court should aid him by petitioning the Commissioner of the Land Office, etc.; stating that in the event he failed to get them located in the reservation, the terms of the old contract should remain as they then existed on the records of the court. This was also approved and entered of record on October 5, 1883, and on the same day the county commissioners, with the county judge, made their application to the Commissioner of the Land Office for patents to the four leagues of land out of the 325 leagues reserved and set apart for the benefit of the unorganized counties.
At a meeting of the Commissioners Court in November of the same year the patents were produced by appellant, and the county judge ordered to execute deeds to appellant. . At the October meeting, when the second proposition was submitted, upon the adjournment of court appellant made a verbal promise to pay an additional $1000, which at the November meeting he was requested or urged by one of the commissioners to do, but which he declined to do. Finally, however, a compromise was effected as to the additional amount claimed under the verbal promise, and the total amount was fixed at $7000. In pursuance of said order of the Commissioners Court warranty deeds, reciting $7000 as the consideration, were duly executed to said appellant, who up to the trial had made his semi-annual interest payments, had gone into the possession of the land by tenants in 1885, had made permanent and valuable improvements thereon, and had paid all the taxes on the same, and the surveyor’s fees and locating expenses.
The proof tended to show that the land was worth at the date of its sale about 50 cents per acre, as well as at the date of the trial. Evidence was introduced as to the value of the improvements and as to the value of the rents, but there was no proof as to how much the improvements enhanced the value of the land. In 1888 La Salle County brought a suit to recover the land, which was dismissed early in 1889, and a second suit brought, which resulted in the judgment appealed from. The written propositions of appellant to the Commissioners Court and the proceedings of said court in relation thereto are set out-in the pleadings of both parties, and are here referred to for fuller explanation of these conclusions.
The court below held that the sale to appellant was void, because a part of the consideration was other than money. On the authority of Tomlinson v. Hopkins County, 57 Texas, 572, we are of opinion that the sale must be held invalid.
The first assignment -complains that the court refused to allow appellant and another witness to state that in the negotiations for the purchase and sale of the land in controversy the services and expenses of appellant did not enter into, nor were they considered by appellant or appellee as forming any part of, the consideration for the land.. The facts and circumstances existing at the time the several propositions and contracts were entered into were fully developed in the proof. Appellant alleged and set out the same propositions and contracts asserted by appellee, copying the same writings in his pleadings, and did not allege any new or different contract from that disclosed by said written instruments. While it maybe that the ground of objection that oral testimony could not be admitted to contradict or vary a written instrument, as urged by appellee in the court below as a reason for the exclusion of said evidence, was not sufficient for that purpose, still we are of opinion that the proposed evidence, which was itself largely a matter of opinion, would not have changed the result had it been admitted.
The second assignment, which complains of the action of the court in admitting the minutes of the Commissioners Court of Martin County for the years 1888 and 1889 to show the valuation placed by that court on the lands in controversy for those years, can not avail appellant, though the testimony was erroneously admitted, because there was no finding upon the issue, and the error was an immaterial one.
The third assignment complains that the court refused and failed to find what it was, and its amount, that entered into the consideration for the purchase and sale of said land over and above the sum of $7000 mentioned in the deed. The answer to this assignment is, that no additional finding was requested, and the general finding that other considerations than money entered into the purchase was not specially excepted to. A general exception will not reach such a defect.
The fourth assignment complains that the court erred in giving rent to plaintiff below on the land from November 17, 1883, and this assignment we think is well taken. Plaintiff did not take possession of the land or use it in any way until the spring of 1885, so far as the record shows. There seems to have been no effort to disaffirm the sale until the year 1888. As improvements were not allowed, if this suit be treated as an action of trespass to try title, appellee was not entitled under the statute-to recover rents for more than two years preceding the institution of this suit; if it be treated as an equitable suit to rescind a sale, then the rents at most should not have extended beyond such time as a purpose was manifested on the part of appellee to rescind said sale — certainly not beyond the time when appellant took possession in the year 1885.
The fifth assignment, that appellant should have been allowed the amount of taxes, etc., paid by him, is not well taken.
The one remaining assignment complains of the action of the court in refusing to allow appellant the value of his improvements placed on the land, aggregating the sum of $7820. This presents the most serious question in the case. The court below, in the seventh conclusion of facts, found that there was no actual or intended fraud in the sale or purchase of said land; but in the eighth conclusion found that defendant was not a purchaser in good faith, entitled to pay for his improvements. Doubtless the court rested his determination of the issue of improvements in this case upon our statute on that subject and the decisions construing it. In this we think there was error. While appellee brought the suit in trespass to try title, the purpose of the action was to annul a deed executed by the county of La Salle to appellant, for want of authority in said county to sell on the terms agreed upon. Appellant in his answer set up his equities as vendee under the contract sought to be annulled, and alleged the money paid appellee and the valuable improvements made under the contract upon the land sought to be recovered. We think under our system that the case as thus presented should have been treated as a suit for rescission, in which “ the right to the value of improvements and the measure of its allowance ’ ’ should 1 ‘ depend on principles of equity, and not on the provisions of the statute regulating the action of trespass to try title.” Patrick v. Roach, 21 Texas, 256; Eberling v. Deutscher Verein, 72 Texas, 341.
Delivered October 25, 1892.
We are of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed as to the recovery of the land, and reversed and remanded for further proceedings in reference to the other issues involved, and it is accordingly so ordered.
Reversed and remanded."
219176,The Western Union Telegraph Company v. R. H. Stephens,1893-01-17,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This appeal is from a verdict and judgment recovered by appellee in the sum of $1000.25, for the negligent failure on the part of appellant to transmit and deliver a telegraphic message from Ardmore, Indian Territory, to Dr. Howard, at Sanger, Texas.
On September 14, 1890, appellee and his wife having a very sick child at Ardmore, whose name was Maggie, and being desirous of securing the immediate attendance of Dr. Howard, who was a practicing physician at Sanger, and the grandfather of the child, determined to summon him by telegram. To accomplish this purpose, appellee on that day delivered to appellant’s agent, addressed to Dr. Howard at Sanger, the following message: “ Maggie is worse. Come at once.” He paid the usual toll, and informed the agent of the importance of the message and the relationship of the parties. The agent promised to transmit the message promptly, if not on that evening, which was Sunday, at least early the next morning. He hung it serenely on a hook in the office and no further attention seems to have been paid to it. The distance to Ardmore was about 60 miles, and there were two trains a day each way. Appellee met each of these trains for four days in expectation of the arrival of Dr. Howard. He did not send an additional message till the 18th, in response to which Dr. Howard, early on the morning of the 19th, arrived at Ardmore. The excuse for not sooner sending this message on the part of appellee was, that as Dr. Howard was a practicing physician, he supposed that owing to absence from home he had not received the first message. The child having steadily grown worse, was on the arrival of Dr. Howard entirely beyond the reach of medical aid, and died on the 21st of September.
We conclude from the evidence contained in the record:
1. That appellant was guilty of gross negligence in failing to transmit and deliver the message.
2. That the absence of Dr. Howard for the space of four days was the proximate result of this negligence.
3. That thereby the mental anguish of appellee and his wife on account of the sickness and death of their child was materially augmented.
4. That this increased mental suffering did not result from contributory negligence on their part.
5. That the amount of the verdict was not in excess of a reasonable compensation for the injury sustained.
The measure of damages alleged by appellee was compensation, not for the mental suffering which resulted from the sickness and death of the child, but for the superadded pain and anguish which resulted from the absence of Dr. Howard until it was entirely too late to afford any relief. This distinction was clearly made in the pleadings, to which appellant excepted, and also in the court’s charge, to which objection is made. We conclude therefore that no error was committed in overruling the exceptions to appellee’s pleading, nor in the charge on the question of the measure of damages. Tel. Co. v. Richardson, 79 Texas, 649.
In submitting the question of contributory negligence, appellant contends that the court erred in limiting that defense to the conduct of appellee, and in not giving, as requested by appellant, a charge which included also the contributory negligence of appellee’s wife as a defense to the action. We find in the record no evidence of any contributory negligence on her part which would not show equal or greater negligence on the part of appellee. That is to say, the jury could not have found that appellee was free from contributory negligence without also finding that his wife was without negligence. We conclude that no injury resulted to appellant by the failure of the court to give the requested instruction on this branch of the case, the court having charged that the contributory negligence of appellee would preclude a recovery. We think the charge of the court as a whole contains a clear and fair statement of the law applicable to the issues developed, and that the several assignments of error complaining of charges given and refused are not well taken.
The action of the court in overruling the motion for a continuance, and in refusing to require appellee to give a cost bond, was manifestly not to the prejudice of appellant, and hence the eighth and ninth assignments of error are not well taken. The assignments of error complaining of the incompetency and insufficiency of the evidence are likewise without merit.
This disposes of all the assignments of error except the one which complains that the verdict of the jury is excessive. Appellant contends that such a verdict would not have been given against an individual upon the same state of facts, and that the fact that appellant was a corporation swelled the amount. We do not assent to this proposition. It seems to us that if a jury had not rendered a verdict under the same facts against an individual for an equal amount, that they might with great propriety have done so. The inherent difficulty of compensating for such an injury in money is fully realized, but the amount allowed in this case does not shock the conscience.
The judgment will therefore be affirmed.

216283,"G. B. Hull et al. v. Naumberg, Krause, Lauer & Co. et al.",1892-11-23,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
Naumberg, Krause, Lauer & Co. were judgment creditors of G-. B. Hull by virtue of a judgment of the County Court of Grayson County, dated February 6, 1889, for the principal sum of $392.15. This judgment was duly and legally fixed as a lien upon the real estate of Hull, by abstract filed on June 1 and August 1, 1889, and recorded and indexed as provided by law.
The Martin Clothing Company was also a creditor of G. B. Hull by virtue of a judgment of the County Court of Grayson County, dated February 6, 1889, for the principal sum of $616.16. This judgment was also duly and legally fixed as a lien upon the real estate of Hull, by abstract filed February 6, 1889, and recorded and indexed as required by law.
G. B. Hull was at the dates named the owner of certain real estate in the town of Pottsboro, occirpied by himself and his wife Julia and their family; and also of a certain business lot and store building which had been used by him while pursuing the occupation of a merchant, but which at the dates named was rented out to others engaged in the mercantile business.
This suit was instituted in the District Court of Grayson County by Naumberg, Krause, Lauer & Co. against G. B. Hull and his wife Julia, the Martin Clothing Company being made a party defendant.
Plaintiffs alleged their judgment and judgment lien upon the property referred to. They alleged that Mrs. Julia Hull was setting up title to the property; that G. B. Hull, through himself or his tenants, was in possession thereof; and that defendants named were falsely claiming it to be their homestead. They also alleged that the Martin Clothing Company was claiming a judgment lien against the property, which, if it existed, was inferior to plaintiffs’ lien. They prayed that their lien be decreed to be superior to that of the Martin Clothing Company; that it be declared and foreclosed against all the parties; that an order of sale issue; and for writ of possession and for general relief.
The Martin Clothing Company answered, asserting its lien and the priority thereof to the lien of plaintiffs. It alleged that the defendants Hull were asserting a fraudulent homestead claim to the property described in plaintiffs’ petition. It prayed for the recognition of its judgment lien as prior to that of plaintiffs, and that the property described be subjected to its lien, and for its order of sale and for general relief.
The defendants G. B. and Julia Hull urged a general demurrer and divers special exceptions, and pleaded the homestead exemption.
The court overruled the demurrers; adjudged that the property on which defendants lived was exempt as their homestead, and as to it found for defendants; decreed the business house and lot to be subject to the judgment liens; adjudged the amount of plaintiffs’ judgment to be $429.47 with 8 per cent interest, and that of the Martin Company to be $684 with 10 per cent interest; adjudged the lien of the Martin Company to be superior to that of the plaintiffs; foreclosed the liens on the property found to be subject to execution, awarding an order of sale and a writ of possession. From this judgment Gf. B. Hull and wife appeal.
Appellants strenuously insist that upon the facts disclosed by the petition this suit can not be maintained; that it is an action of debt on a judgment which was not dormant and which had not lost its lien under the statute.; that the judgment lien being general will not support an action for foreclosure upon a specific tract of land; that the judgment creditor can not (as he seeks to do) invoke the equity powers of the court against any particular tract of land, but that he must resort in the first instance to the process of execution, levy, and sale; that the judgments involved having been rendered by the County Court, the District Court is without jurisdiction to enforce or foreclose liens securing the judgment of a court of inferior jurisdiction.
It is true that this case presents the features involved and criticised in the foregoing propositions, but it is something more than a suit for the purposes named. It involves an inquiry into the homestead claim alleged to be false and pretended, which consequenty burdens the property that plaintiffs claim to be subject to their judgment lien, and which, unless removed, impairs the efficacy of the lien. By this action plaintiffs in effect seek to have this homestead claim held for nought.
It has been held by our Supreme Court that a creditor having a judgment lien against the real estate of a debtor may maintain a suit to assert such lien against his debtor and another to whom the property had been fraudulently conveyed, without in the first instance procuring execution and levy. Lynn v. Le Gierse, 48 Texas, 138; Cassaday v. Anderson, 53 Texas, 536; Gaines v. Bank, 64 Texas, 18.
An equitable proceeding is justified under such circumstances, on the ground that the conveyance beclouds the title, depreciates the property, and thus, uncancelled, impedes the creditor from realizing on his judgment.
We think that the effect of the fraudulent homestead claim would be the same as in the case of a fraudulent conveyance, and that it would equally justify a resort to equity. Nor is this conclusion affected by the fact that in this instance the judgments sought to be enforced emanated from a County instead of a District Court. They were nevertheless liens upon the real estate of the defendant Hull, and their efficacy was impaired (if the plaintiffs’ allegations were true) by the fraudulent homstead claim of the defendants. The homestead claim is a claim to an estate in land, and a suit to hold it for nought and to subject the property to a judgmen! lien, which, as we understand, is the nature of this proceeding, is properly brought in the District Court. If the plaintiffs had adopted the method suggested by the appellants, and had purchased the property at execution sale under their judgment, they would then in an action of trespass to try title have had to test the validity of their judgment and of their lien and the merits of the defendants’ homestead claim. We see no good reason why, in the first instance, they can not in the same tribunal test the same questions by the simpler and less expensive means here pursued.
We are thus brought to the complaint that the court erred in finding against the homestead claim of the defendants with reference to the business house and lot involved.
This property consisted of a lot and a two-story stone building. It was separated from the residence property adjudged to the defendants. G-. B. Hull had been pursuing the business of a merchant in this building. In December, 1888, he became embarrassed and sold his stock of goods to Schneider Bros. & Co. At this time (December 15, 1888) he leased the lower story of his building to his vendees until January, 1889. He then leased a part of this story to one Neff for the year 1889, and a portion to the United States postmaster for an indefinite period, rent payable monthly. The upper story he rented to the Masonic lodge for a term of five years, beginning January 1, 1889. He himself after the sale engaged in the occupation of a drayman. The defendant stated that when he sold his merchandise and rented his store house he did not intend to abandon it as a place of business; that he expected to resume business “as soon as he was able to do so;” that this ability depended upon his realizing upon notes and accounts due him, which he reasonably expected to collect, and also upon a remittance of $2000 expected by his wife from her father’s estate in Tennessee; that the money to be thus collected he would apply to his debts, when he would again resume business in the store house, which he still claimed as his business homestead.
It was shown that at this time the defendant’s debts amounted to $1795, and the evidence indicated that the notes and accounts referred to were against insolvent parties.
When the defendant sold his stock of merchandise he ceased altogether to follow that business. The property was not thereafter in any sense used by him as a place to follow the occupation or calling of the head of a family. The only specific business in which he thereafter engaged was that of drayman, in connection with which the property was in no way used and to which it was not adapted. We do not think that the mere intention to again resume business in this property at an indefinite time in the future, dependent upon a contingency which might never happen, could retain and perpetuate in it the homestead character. Such an intention is immaterial. Shryock v. Latimer, 57 Texas, 674; Pfeiffer v. McNatt, 74 Texas, 640; Hill v. Hill’s Estate, 19 S. W. Rep., 75.

219234,"P. J. Willis & Bro. v. M. A. Byars, Administratrix",1893-01-17,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
The controlling question in this case arises upon the admission of paroi testimony to add to, and hence vary, one or more written instruments; it being contended by appellee that the testimony admitted came within the exceptions to the general rule on that subject. The written agreement between the parties, executed on the 25th day of May, 1886, omitting description of the property, reads as follows:
“State of Texas, County of Wilbarger.—This agreement, made and entered into this day by and between P. J. Willis & Bro., of Galveston, Texas, of the first part, and Mrs. M. A. Byars, of Vernon, Texas, of the second part, witnesseth:
“ That the party of the first part agreed not to defend case number 44, M. A. Byars v. P. J. Willis & Bro., in the District Court of Wilbarger County, Texas, but to allow the injunction asked therein to be made perpetual, upon the party of the second part paying all costs in said case which shall be adjudged against her.
“And said parties of the first part further agree to release and quitclaim to the said party of the second part all their right, title, and interest and claim in and to lots numbers 11,12,13, 14, and 15, in block number 31, now occupied as a homestead by party of the second part. In consideration of all which said party of the second part agrees to release and quitclaim to said parties of the first part all her right, title., and claim in and to the following lots and parcels of land in the town of Vernon, Wilbarger County, Texas. * * *
“All said property being and lying in said town of Vernon, and the additions thereto, in Wilbarger County, Texas.
“And the said party of the second part further agrees to dismiss case number 78, M. A. Byars v. P. J. Willis & Bro., and number 81’, M. A. Byars v. P. J. Willis & Bro., on the District Court docket in Wilbarger County, Texas, and to pay all costs in said two cases. And it is further agreed, in consideration of the above quitclaim deed, to be executed, by the said party of the first part, that the said party of the second part further release all claims for damages against the said party of the first part by reason of the suits, judgments, levies heretofore made and instituted by the said P. J. Willis & Bro. against C. M. Byars and herself. Witness our hands, this 25th day of May, 1886.
“ Witnesses: M. A. Byars,
“ Henry Finch, P. J. Willis & Bro.,
“Dave McBride. Per Geo. Diehl. Agent.”
In accordance with this agreement, there was executed by appellee, contemporaneously therewith, a quitclaim deed to appellants to certain lots of land therein set out, for the recited consideration of 81 and a release and quitclaim to certain other lots of land therein set out, executed by appellants to appellee. This deed contained the further recital that, “my husband, C. M. Byars, having left and abandoned me, and now being absent from the State, having been away for months, I make this quitclaim and release as the remaining manager of the community property, and to further protect its interest.” In other respects, it was a quitclaim deed in the usual form, reciting only the considerations above specified.
The contention of appellee was that these writings did not contain the full contract; and she offered and was permitted, over the objection of appellants, to prove orally, that in addition to the matters settled and agreed upon, as shown by these writings, it was further agreed by appellant’s agent, George Diehl, that a certain judgment which had been recovered in 1883 by appellants against C. M. Byars, in the District Court of Galveston County for over $4000, should also be considered settled on that day and by the agreement then entered into, and that thereafter said Diehl would mark the same satisfied on the record of said suit in Galveston County.
Appellants objected to the introduction of this evidence as being violative of the rule which excludes oral testimony where it has the effect of varying a contemporaneous written instrument.
Appellee alleged, that either through mistake or fraud, this part of the-agreement was not specified in the written instruments above set out.
The testimony, however, does not seem to have been admitted upon this ground; and the court in the charge did not submit that issue to the-jury, but instructed them that if at the time of the execution and delivery of the deed from M. A. Byars to plaintiffs below, it was understood and agreed by both deféndant and plaintiff’s agent, George Diehl, that the deed should be accepted by plaintiffs in full satisfaction and payment of said judgment, and that said Diehl had authority to settle said judgment, that they should find in favor of appellee upon that issue. This charge is also complained of by appellants.
The first contention of appellee, in support of the action of the court, is, “Where written instruments form a part of""a more comprehensive transaction, the terms of which are not attempted to be expressed in writing, paroi evidence as to such parts of the transaction as were not reduced, to writing is admissible;” citing the case of Thomas v. Hammond, 47 Texas, 54, and other cases.
These cases announce the correct rule where no attempt is made to reduce the more comprehensive agreement to writing. That, in our opinion, is not this case. Here the parties undertook with care to reduce to writing an agreement comprehending several different transactions. The agreement on its face appears to be complete. As to whether there was- or was not at the time, as a part of the settlement, an additional verbal agreement to satisfy the original judgment, the statements of the witnesses-for appellants and appellee were in sharp contradiction. To prevent such a result is evidently one of the objects of the rule which holds the writing to contain the entire agreement where on its face it appears to be, though not in fact, complete, and it is not shown that this appearance of completeness results from fraud, accident, or mistake. Belcher v. Mulhall & Scaling, 57 Texas, 18, and cases there cited.
Appellee’s second contention is, that paroi evidence was admissible to-show that the consideration for the quitclaim deed executed by appellee was not fully expressed; but that, in addition to the considerations named, it was agreed that the judgment in question should be satisfied. This proposition seems to have been decided against appellee by us at a former day of this term in the following cases: Weaver v. The City of Gainesville (1 Texas Civil Appeals, 286), and Rubrecht v. Powers (Id., 282).
Our construction of the written instruments executed as above set forth, and constituting one transaction, leads to the conclusion that oral testimony to incorporate as a part thereof the agreement to satisfy the Galveston judgment was erroneous and necessitates a reversal of the judgment. We are, however, of the opinion that the court did not err in refusing to strike out appellee’s plea in reconvention.
The questions raised by the other assignments of error are not likely to arise upon another trial, and hence need not be considered.
The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.

216256,Albert Metzler et al. v. J. O. Johnson,1892-10-25,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On December 17, 1887, one George G. Koenig forwarded his application, affidavit, obligation, and first payment to purchase section 14, block 1, containing 640 acres of the public school land, under the Act of 1887 providing for its sale.
This affidavit, application, and obligation were received by the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the land awarded to Koenig, to take effect as of the date aforesaid. Koenig’s application and affidavit represented himself as an actual settler, and stated that he desired to purchase the land for a home in compliance with the provisions of the act.
The verdict of the jury, as we think upon sufficient evidence, establishes that Koenig was not a settler within the meaning of the law, and did not purchase for the purpose of making the land his home.
Appellant Metzler claimed under Koenig.
In 1888 appellee Johnson actually settled upon the land for the purpose of making it his home, as established by the verdict of the jury upon sufficient evidence, and attempted to purchase the same under the law in good faith for a home. Johnson forwarded all necessary papers to the Commissioner of the Land Office, and his first payment to the Treasurer, these papers being in form in compliance with the law under which he was seeking to purchase. The Commissioner declined to award him the land because of the previous sale to Koenig, and directed the Treasurer to return appellee’s money to him, which was done.
Appellee has been in possession of the land, living thereon and cultivating it as a home, ever since he settled thereon as aforesaid, and in February, 1889, filed his petition in the form of trespass to try title against appellant Metzler, and thereafter made Koenig a defendant.
The ease was submitted by the court to the jury upon the issue as to whether or not Koenig in good faith was a settler upon the land and purchased the same for a home within the meaning of the law. Verdict and judgment were rendered in favor of the appellee upon this issue, from which this appeal is prosecuted.
From the foregoing findings of fact it will be seen that the first and most important question for us to decide is as to whether or not the fact that Koenig did not in good faith intend the land in controversy as a home, but was seeking to acquire it in fraud of the law, which allowed sales to be made to actual settlers only, could be taken advantage of by appellee after Koenig’s obligation and first payment had been accepted by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and before a forfeiture had been declared against him by the proper authorities. In other words, are the qualifications of a proposed purchaser of public school lands under the Act of 1887, and the subsequent compliance with the terms of his purchase as to the three years occupancy, solely questions between such purchaser and the State, or can they be inquired into before the issuance of the patent by others who may- wish to become bona fide purchasers in compliance with the terms of the law P We have had great difficult)' in solving this question to our satisfaction. A long line of decisions in this State has settled the law to be, that where the State has issued a grant, it alone can ordinarily have a forfeiture declared for a failure to comply with the terms of the grant. Luter v. Mayfield, 26 Texas, 325; Bowmer v. Hicks, 22 Texas, 162; Johnston v. Smith, 21 Texas, 729, and numerous other cases. And in quite a recent case the subject of the forfeiture of a charter granted a railroad by the State has been under investigation by our Supreme Court, and the familiar principle affirmed that a cause of forfeiture can not ordinarily be taken advantage of by a third party until the State has acted in the matter. Railway v. The State, 81 Texas, 595. The difficulty, however, is to determine as to whether or not these principles apply to the case at bar, and we have arrived at the conclusion that they do not.
The law under which this sale was made provides, that “All sales shall be made by the Commissioner of the General Land Office or under his direction, and he shall prescribe suitable regulations whereby the purchasers shall be required to reside upon as a home the land purchased by them for three consecutive years next succeeding the date of their purchase. 1 * * * Any person desiring to purchase land in accordance with the provisions of this act shall forward his application to the Commissioner, particularly describing the land sought to be purchased, which application shall in all cases be accompanied with the affidavit of the applicant in effect that he desires to purchase the land for a home, and has in good faith settled thereon; and he shall also swear that he is not acting in collusion with others for the purpose of buying the land for any other person or corporation, and that no other person or corporation is interested in the purchase save himself. The purchaser shall transmit to the Treasurer of the State one-fortieth of the aggregate purchase money for the particular tract of land, and send to the Commissioner his obligation to the State, duly executed and binding the purchaser to pay to the State on the first day of August of each year thereafter, until the whole purchase money is paid, one-fortieth of the aggregate price, with interest from date at the rate of 5 per cent per annum on the whole purchase money; and upon receipt of one-fortieth of the purchase money by the Treasurer and the affidavit and obligation aforesaid by the Commissioner, the sale shall be deemed and held effective from the date the affidavit and application are filed in the General Land Office.”
It will thus be seen that while by the terms of the law the Commissioner is to make the sale, yet there is nothing in fact to be done by him save receiving the application, affidavit, and obligation of the proposed purchaser. He is nowhere given discretion to accept or rej ect these papers. The sale is really made by the purchaser accepting the proposition made by the law. This proposition is one made to persons of a certain class, namely, those who purchase the land for a home and have in good faith settled thereon. No other class of persons have the right to accept this proposition made by the law, and even if the Commissioner desired to accept a proposition from some one who did- not propose to make the land his home, he had no power to do so in making the sale. The whole power of the Commissioner is exhausted when he receives the papers accepting the proposition made by the law.
In submitting the case to the jury the court instructed them as follows :
‘ ‘ First. If George Koenig settled upon the land in controversy in good faith, and if he made application for the purchase of said land for the purpose of -a home, and if he so resided upon and improved the land at the time of plaintiff’s application to purchase, and if defendant bought said land from Koenig in good faith for the purpose of a home and with the intention of residing thereon, then defendant is entitled to recover.
“ Second. If you find from the evidence that said Koenig did not settle upon the land in controversy in.good faith for the purpose of a home, or if said Koenig was not residing upon the land at the date of plaintiff making application to purchase and taking possession of the land in controversy, and if plaintiff settled upon the land in controversy under application to purchase the same in good faith for the purpose of a home, you will find for plaintiff.’ ’
The verdict in favor of plaintiff under the evidence established in effect that Koenig at the time he made application to purchase the land under the law above set forth did not do so in good faith with the intention of making his home thereon; and that he was not residing upon the land, and in fact had never resided thereon at the time of plaintiff’s attempted purchase, which was several months after Koenig’s application. Baker v. Millman, 77 Texas, 47.
We believe, therefore, that the court was correct in holding that under these circumstances Koenig was not one of the persons who has a right to accept the proposition made by the law, and his false affidavit and application (as established by the verdict of the jury), with the execution of the obligation and making the first payment as required by the law, did not interpose a legal obstacle to another purchaser who came within the provisions of the law, and who proposed in good faith to comply therewith. Martin v. Brown, 62 Texas, 469.
We believe the rights of different parties attempting to purchase the same land under the provisions of this law should be treated as being more in analogy to the rights of different locators upon vacant land previous to the issuance of patent, rather than upon the principles governing a forfeiture after the issuance of a grant, and we believe the courts have uniformly been open to the investigation of the respective priorities of persons of the first class.
In providing for the forfeiture of land purchased under this law. the act says: “ If upon the first day of August of any year the interest due upon any obligation remains unpaid, the Commissioner of the General Land Office shall endorse on said obligation 1 land forfeited,’ and shall cause an entry to that effect to be made on the account kept with the purchaser, and thereupon said lands shall be forfeited to the State without the necessity of re-entry or judicial ascertainment; * * * and if any purchaser shall fail to reside upon and improve in good faith the land purchased by him, he shall forfeit said land and all payments made thereon to the State, and such land shall be again for sale, as if no such sale and forfeiture had occurred.”
As to what would be necessary in a case where a settler had made his purchase in good faith under the law, and after residing upon the land for a time had abandoned the same, in order to again open the land for purchase under above provision of the law, we hardly think it necessary for us to decide, as the jury under the evidence must have concluded that Koenig never at any time intended to settle upon the land and make it his home within the meaning of the law.
We believe, however, if the wording of the charge of the court quoted above should make a decision of this question necessary, the better opinion would be to hold, that inasmuch as the sale is between the law and the proposed purchaser, the latter should be held to a compliance with the terms of his purchase in order to hold the land from other purchasers, and as to whether he has done this or not can be contested in the courts until the final proof is made, upon the same principles that other attempted appropriations of public land can be so contested. The forfeiture provided for a failure to properly return the field notes of a survey under the Act of 1852, in order to open the land to other locators, is declared in language but little differing from the forfeiture declared for a failure to reside and improve under this act; and under the former act the right of a subsequent locator to contest in the courts as to whether it had been complied with was well settled. Upshur v. Pace, 15 Texas, 531; Johns v. Pace, 26 Texas, 271.
If we are correct in the foregoing conclusions, it follows that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed. The evidence is undisputed, that the appellee, Johnson, was a settler in good faith, and had complied with the provisions of the law so as to entitle him to the land if the prior attempted purchase by Koenig did not give the claim under him a better right; and we believe if Johnson had the right to make his purchase under the law, the Commissioner had no power to deny him this right by refusing to accept his application, and that this attempt to purchase on his part, coupled with his actual possession, entitled him to the judgment he obtained. Cattle Co. v. Bacon & Graves, 79 Texas, 12.

219215,"Nettie M. Johnson et al. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company",1893-01-17,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On the 5th day of August, 1886, William A. Johnson was run over and killed by one of the hand cars of appellee, where its track crosses a wagon road at what is known as McPherson’s Crossing, in Johnson County, Texas.
It seems that deceased was blind, and was in the rear end of a wagon leading a horse, which wagon was being driven by his father, George Johnson. The two were going after some water for their joint use, and to also give water to the horse which was being led, and which was their joint property. In approaching the crossing, the driver, George Johnson, saw the hand car when it was at a distance of 500 or 600 yards, and there was nothing to prevent the hands on the car from also seeing the wagon. When the wagon reahhed the crossing the car was at a distance of from 50 to 65 yards, and it seems that the horse deceased was leading, just as the wagon got over the track, became frightened and pulled back, throwing deceased upon the track in front of the car, where he was struck. From the injuries so received the said William A. Johnson died on the 6th of August, 1886, and appellants instituted this suit to recover the ■damage caused them by such death.
Appellants complain at the action of the court in giving the following charge to the jury: “ If the defendant’s employes in charge of the hand car saw the wagon of G. W. Johnson, in which deceased was riding, stop before reaching the railway, and were thereby led to believe no effort would be made to cross said railway, until it passed the crossing, then it was not negligence in said employes not to stop said hand car,” etc.
Some of the witnesses testified, that when the wagon got near the crossing it stopped and then started again; while others testify that no stop was made, and still others that there was no entire stop, but only a slight checking of the horses. That this charge in this state of the evidence was upon the weight of the evidence, and was therefore improperly given, is well illustrated by quite a number of cases in this State. See Railway v. Roberts, ante, p. Ill, where a number of these cases are referred to; Costley v. Railway, 70 Texas, 112.
The question as to what does or does not constitute negligence where there is a conflict in the evidence, is one peculiarly for the jury. The charge is also objectionable, in that the jury might have understood therefrom that the court was of the opinion that the wagon did stop, and only left it for them to decide as to whether or not appellee’s employes saw it and were influenced thereby, when, as we have seen, it was a controverted question as to whether or not the wagon stopped at all. The giving of this charge will therefore necessitate a reversal of the judgment; and without undertaking to discuss the several errors assigned, by appellants seriatim, we will attempt to givers concisely as possible, our views of the law applicable to the case as it may be presented upon another trial.
The grounds relied upon by appellants in their petition for recovery are two: 1. They allege gross negligence on the part of the servants of appellee in charge of the hand car. 2. They allege negligence on the part of appellee in permitting the use of a defective hand car, or of a hand car not provided with the most efficient kind of brakes.
This death having been caused in 1886, prior to the amendment of our statute upon this subject, to entitle appellants to recover on account of the acts of the servants of appellee it will be necessary that the evidence show gross negligence on their part. Railway v. Kutac, 76 Texas, 474; Railway v. Hill, 71 Texas, 451.
It is doubtful whether in this class of cases it is advisable for the trial court to attempt to define what is meant by the term “ gross negligence.” Railway v. Shuford, 72 Texas, 170. But, if it be deemed necessary to make this attempt, the definition as given in the charge of the court does not seem to us to be objectionable. Railway v. Kutac, supra; Railway v. Cocke, 64 Texas, 156; Railway v. Shuford, supra.
If, however, appellants base their right to recover on the negligence of appellee in permitting the use of an improper car, it will only be necessary for them to show ordinary negligence on its part. Railway v. Geiger, 79 Texas, 13; Railway v. Johnson, 1 Texas Civ. App., 103.
That it is the duty of a railway company to adopt well tested inventions and improvements for the protection of persons lawfully upon its track at highway crossings, we think there can be no question. Mr. Pierce, in his excellent work on Railroads, page 355, says: “ The duty of the company to avail itself of well tested inventions and improvements which materially contribute to safety, has been much considered with reference to its passengers; but it is a duty which extends also to other persons rightfully using or crossing its track. Thus it should use the brakes which are found to be the most efficient for stopping trains.” If, therefore, the jury, under proper instructions, should find that deceased was not chargeable with contributory negligence in being upon appellee’s track at the time he was run over by its car, and appellee was guilty of ordinary negligence in permitting the use of said car under the rules of law herein indicated, and this negligence was the proximate cause of the death, it would be liable therefor.
The proximate cause of an injury is ordinarily a question for the jury, and it is very difficult to give a definition which will apply to all cases. In the case of Jones v. George, 61 Texas, 352, in quoting from Railway v. Kellogg, 94 United States, 475, it is said: 4‘ It is generally held, that in order to warrant a finding that negligence is the proximate cause of an injury, it must appear that the injury was the natural and probable consequence of the negligence or wrongful act, and that it ought to have been forseen in the light of the attending circumstances.” The definition given by the court in its charge is perhaps subject to criticism when so tested; but in the connection in which it was given it furnished no cause of complaint to appellants, being in their favor and not to their injury.
In deciding whether or not deceased was guilty of contributory negligence in being caught upon the track of appellee, several important questions are presented. In the first place, is negligence on the part of .the driver of the wagon to be charged to him ? If the jury should find that deceased and his father were engaged in a joint undertaking, it is settled in this State that each would be responsible for the negligence of the other. Railway v. Kutac, 72 Texas, 643. And without undertaking to review the numerous cases in this country discussing the noted English case of Thorogood v. Bryan, 8 C. B., 115, we think it is fairly deducible from the authorities that if deceased was blind so as to be unable to take care of himself, and of his own volition confided himself to the care of his father, the negligence of such custodian should be imputed to him; in such case he would be his agent. For a full discussion of the different cases upon this interesting question, see Beach on Contributory Negligence, commencing at section 103; also note to Gray v. Railway, 22 American and English Bailway Cases, commencing on page 355.
In deciding as to whether or not George Johnson was guilty of negligence in attempting to cross the track in front of the car, it will be necessary for the jury, under proper instructions, to take into consideration all the attendant circumstances, such as the distance the car was from the crossing at the time the attempt was made, the speed at which it was coming, and also the kind of car. The jury might find that a person would be justified in attempting to cross in front of a hand car when he would not be justified under the same circumstances were the car being drawn by a locomotive. 2 Wood’s By. Law, 1315. If it be found that there was time to cross the track in safety under ordinary circumstances, it would seem that Johnson should not be charged with contributory negligence for failing to anticipate an unusual occurrence, such as falling upon the track, unless there was reason to anticipate such falling from the surrounding circumstances: Pierce on Bys., 347; 2 Wood’s By. Law, 1314.
In this State it is held, that even where a person is wrongfully on the track, if an unforseen accident or providential cause intervenes which retains him there, his negligence in going upon the track will be deemed the remote and not the proximate cause of his injuries, and he will not thereby be precluded from recovering. Railway v. Sympkins, 54 Texas, 615; Roberts v. Railway. supra. If, therefore, the jury should find that had it not been for the horse pulling deceased off of the wagon the crossing would have been made in safety, and that it was not negligence on the part of the driver in failing to anticipate this result, and that appellee was guilty of negligence in permitting the use by its servants of an improper car, or that appellee’s servants were guilty of gross negligence, and that such negligence on the part of appellee or its servants was the proximate cause of the injury, and should such findings be sustained by the evidence, we think appellants would be entitled to recover.
Appellants present a number of assignments, calling in question the action of the court below in the admission of evidence. It is hardly probable that these objections will arise in the same form upon another trial. The evidence seems to have been offered to impeach appellants’ witness George Johnson, by showing that he had made statements ont of court inconsistent with his evidence given upon the trial. We think the proper predicate was laid for most, if not all, of these questions. The law upon the admissibility of this kind of evidence is so well settled that there need be no error made in the rulings upon this branch of the case upon another trial, without further dicussion from us.
We think what we have already said sufficiently indicates our views upon the other questions raised by appellants’ assignments of error.
Let the judgment of the court below be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.
Reversed and remanded.

A motion for rehearing in this case was overruled."
216203,"Saint Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company v. R. L. Putnam",1892-10-25,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This suit was brought by appellee against appellant, to recover damages for personal injuries, and resulted in a verdict and judgment for appellee, from which the appellant has prosecuted this appeal.
Appellee was employed as a brakeman by appellant. While coupling cars in the discharge of Ms duty his hand was mashed and his thumb injured. The cars were not the property of appellant, but belonged to a connecting line. There was a defect in the cars, which was the cause of the injury. The jury found that the company had failed, through its inspector, to use due care in inspecting the cars and in providing against the danger incident to handling them. The appellant contended, and here contends, that because of the fact that the cars were foreign cars the company did not owe the same measure of diligence in guarding against defects as if they had been its property. Appellant also contended, and here insists, that because of this fact the inspector and appellee were fellow servants, and that for this reason the negligence of the former should be imputed to the latter. Appellant asked special instructions covering these defenses, which were refused by the court. This refusal is assigned as error.
Delivered October 25, 1892.
The action of the court is sustained by us. Our Supreme Court has held, correctly, we think, that a railway company is under the same obligation to furnish safe appliances for the use of its employes, whether the cars belong to it or to a connecting line, and that the doctrine applying to fellow servants does not obtain under the circumstances here stated. Railway v. Kernan, 78 Texas, 294.
The judgment is therefore affirmed.
Affirmed.
Justice Head did not sit in this case."
216191,Edward Martin v. Western Union Telegraph Company,1892-10-19,"KEY, Associate Justice.
The court below sustained a general demurrer to the plaintiff’s petition; and he having declined to amend, judgment was rendered dismissing the suit, from which judgment this writ of error is prosecuted. There are three assignments of error, each raising the only question for this court to consider, which is the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s petition as against a general demurrer.
This petition (omitting certain formal parts) is as follows:
‘ ‘ That plaintiff is a resident citizen of the city of St. Louis, State of Missouri, and that the Western Union Telegraph Company is a private corporation, duly incorporated under and by virtue of the laws of the State of New York, with Jay Gould as president thereof, and said Western Union Telegraph Company has for the last ten years continually held itself out as a telegraph company, and offered as such to receive and transmit messages from any point on its line to any other point thereon, which said points on its line do now and for ten years last past have embraced Belton and Austin in the State of Texas and St. Louis in the State of Missouri; which said business was carried on in consideration of the payment received therefor and the profits arising therefrom, and said defendant during said period of time has held itself as authorized and ready to do said business.
“Plaintiff further alleges, that on, to-wit, the 16th day of February, A. D. 1884, he was associated with John Martin in the mercantile business in the city of St. Louis in the State of Missouri, under the firm name and style of Edward Martin & Co., and that they then and there held a claim, which was just and equitable, against Samuel T. Woodworth, of Belton, Bell County, Texas, amounting to the sum of $1575.80, all of which was due and payable excepting $655.65, which would become due and payable on March 4, 1884. That said Samuel T. Woodworth was then in failing circumstances and was about to be attached by other creditors on the 16th day of February, A. D. 1884, when Montieth & Furman, attorneys at law, of Belton, Texas, and who then and there were acting for said firm of Edward Martin & Co. at their request and as under their employment, prepared a dispatch to James P. Maginn, attorney at law, at St. Louis, Missouri, and who was then and there the attorney of said firm of Edward Martin & Co. in St. Louis, Missouri, and delivered the same at 2 o’clock and 45 minutes p. m. on February 16, A. D. 1884, to the Frontier Telegraph Company, and which was immediately received and transmitted by said Frontier Telegraph Company to the Western Union Telegraph Company, and by it received at 2 o’clock and 45 minutes p. m. on February 16, A. D. 1884, as first written, and sent and transmitted by it to James P. Maginn at St. Louis, State of Missouri. Plaintiff alleges, that said dispatch read as follows, or substantially as follows, and so read at the time when it came into the hands of defendant herein for transmission:
“ Belton, Texas, February 16, 1884.
“ ‘James P. Maginn, St. Louis, Mo.:
“ ‘ Martin & Co. hold note of Sam. Woodworth; will be attached tonight; your bank telegraph Miller Brothers, bankers, to make bond.
“ ‘ 22 collect. 2:45 p. m. Monteith & Furman.’
“ Plaintiff alleges, that by the negligence and carelessness of defendant, its agents and employes, the message was not delivered on that day nor on the succeeding day, but was carelessly and negligently withheld from said James P. Maginn, and he had no notice of the matters referred to-until the 18th day of February, A. D. 1884. Plaintiff alleges, that if said message had been transmitted with proper skill and reasonable rapidity it would have come to the hands of James P. Maginn by 3 o’clock p. m. of the 16th day of February, 1884, and then been by him communicated to Edward Martin & Co., and reply received by said James P. Maginn, and been by him or said Edward Martin & Co., or some good or solvent bank of St. Louis, Mo., answered, either by telegraphing Miller & Brothers or some one else who could have obtained the execution of a good and sufficient bond for attachment which would have been approved by the district clerk of Bell County, Texas, which said answer of said telegram should have been obtained and transmitted by said Western Union Telegraph Company and received by the person to whom the same was sent by 6 o’clock p. m. on the 16th day of February, 1884; and plaintiff alleges, that by the use of reasonable promptness on the part of said Western Union Telegraph Company and by the use of reasonable promptness by James P. Maginn and said Edward Martin & Co., which would have been executed, and by reasonable promptness on the part of said Western Union Telegraph Company in transmitting said replying message from St. Louis, Mo., to Belton, Texas, such answer could and should have been returned by 6 o’clock p. m., February 16, 1884; but plaintiff alleges, that if the same had been received by 8 or even 10 o’clock p. in. of February 16, 1884, the same would have been in time for said Martin & Co. to have saved their indebtedness by obtaining a writ of attachment. And plaintiff alleges, that said Monteith & Furman had prepared a petition, which was°in due form, and an affidavit for attachment in blank, which could, upon getting a telegram, be quickly closed and completed, and Miller Brothers, bankers, of Belton, Texas, had promised upon obtaining an authorizing telegram from some good and solvent bank to go upon said attachment bond as security thereon, and A. M. Monteith stood ready to make affidavit such as is required by law upon which an attachment should issue; and arrangements had been made with the clerk of the District Court of Bell County to stand read)7 to issue writ of attachment and approve bond in legal form and with approved security, which could and would have been readily made if a proper answer had been made to said telegram which had been promptly returned to Belton. And plaintiff alleges, that he stood ready and willing to answer said telegram, and could readily and promptly have provided an attachment bond through a good and reliable bank in St. Louis, Mo., who would have telegrahed Miller Brothers to make bond for Edward Martin, and the said bank would save said Miller Brothers from all loss and damage whatever.
“And plaintiff alleges, that until 11 o’clock p. m. on the 16tli day of February, A. D. 1884, there were sufficient goods, wares, and merchandise of Samuel T. Woodworth subject to attachment to satisfy the debt, interest, and cost of suit, which would have been recovered by judgment from Samuel T. Woodworth at the suit of Edward Martin & Co., and which would have been duly collected by such attachment and judgment of the court; and plaintiff further alleges, that suit would have been instituted, and the goods of Samuel T. Woodworth sufficient to satisfy said indebtedness of Edward Martin & Co. attached, and said indebtedness of Samuel T. Woodworth fully paid and discharged, and that there was good and legal grounds for the issuance of said writ of attachment for such purpose. And plaintiff further alleges, that the nature and purpose of such dispatch, as revealed upon the face thereof, were sufficient to put the said Western Union Telegraph Company upon notice of the importance of such dispatch being promptly and correctly forwarded to said James P. Maginn, in order that the indebtedness therein referred to might be saved or secured, but that defendant, although it had such knowledge by its officers and agents for receiving, transmitting, and delivering, did so carelessly and negligently, so that a mistake was made in the transmitting and delivery of such message, and said message was not delivered until two days after it should have been, to plaintiff’s great damage, he now being the owner of such claim, in the sum of $3000.
“And plaintiff further alleges, that said Edward Martin & Co., in reply to said telegram to James P. Maginn, would also have telegraphed to Monteith & Furman a statement of the amount of their claim against Samuel T. Woodworth, and also a statement as to when the same would become due, for the instruction of said Monteith & Furman as to filling in their allegation in their petition of Edward Martin & Co. v. Samuel T. Woodworth, and affidavit for writ of attachment and bond for attachment to said cause. And plaintiff alleges, that said Sam. T. Woodworth since the 16tli day of February, A. D. 1884, has been insolvent and no sum of money could be made out of him by process of law, and said Samuel T. Woodworth would not willingly pay anything on such indebtedness.
“ Plaintiff further alleges, that said firm of Edward Martin & Co. prior to the institution of this suit was dissolved, and the claim of Edward Martin & Co. against the Western Union Telegraph Company was duly assigned and transferred for a valuable consideration to plaintiff herein and is now his property, and he now sues upon the same in his own name. And plaintiff alleges, that answer to said dispatch ought to have been received at Belton, Texas, by 6 o’clock p. m. of February 16, 1884. Plaintiff further alleges, that he gave due notice as required by law and regulations of the Western Union Telegraph Company of the loss and injury which was occasioned to said Edward Martin & Co., and within the time prescribed by the rules and regulations of said Western Union Telegraph Company, which company refused to pay and satisfy the same in whole or in part; and plaintiff alleges, that plaintiff paid toll for transmission of said message to St. Louis, Missouri, the sum of $1.35, which has not been returned to plaintiff.
“ Wherefore, the premises considered, plaintiff prays that defendant be duly cited to appear and answer this petition, and that on final hearing plaintiff have judgment for said sum of $3000 damages caused to him, and for his toll paid $1.35, and for such other and further relief as plaintiff may in law and in equity be entitled to, and as in duty bound, and will ever pray,” etc.
It is contended by defendant in error that the demurrer to the petition was properly sustained, because:
1. The petition charged a breach of contract with the Frontier Telegraph Company, and seeks to hold defendant in error liable therefor.
2. Unless there was a limitation to the contract by which the company restricted its liability to its line, or some statute controlled this, the Frontier Telegraph Company’s contract will be construed to bind it to deliver the message to the addressee..
3. Plaintiff in error was neither the sender nor addressee of the message.
4. The petition showed too many contingencies to happen after a prompt delivery of the message before plaintiff could have secured his debt.
As to the first of these propositions, the petition alleges that Monteith <Jr Furman delivered the message to the Frontier Telegraph Company and that it immediately transmitted it to defendant in error; that the latter received it and sent and transmitted it to Maginn at St. Louis, etc. Whether the Frontier Telegraph Company is to be considered in delivering the message to defendant in error as its agent or as the agent of the senders is not material; but when the defendant received and undertook to transmit the message, it rested under the implied obligation to do so with the same diligence and expedition as if it had expressly agreed to transmit it. The facts alleged show an implied contract.
Concerning the second proposition, if we are correct in holding that the allegations of the petition show an implied contract by the defendant in error to properly transmit the message, it follows necessarily that it is liable for any breach on its part of such contract.
It has been ’held in New York, that in the absence of a special agreement or arrangement either with the sender of the message or between the connecting lines, the company on whose line the default resulting in loss occurs is the proper party to be sued. Baldwin v. Tel. Co., 45 N. Y. (6 Hand), 744.
With reference to the third contention, it is true that the message was sent by Monteith & Furman, but the petition avers that they were acting for Edward Martin & Co., and the message itself shows that it was intended for their benefit. It discloses the fact that they held a claim against Woodworth that was in peril. It has been held in this State, that where one person, for a valuable consideration, agrees to pay a debt owing by the other party to the contract to a third person, that such third person, though not a party to the contract, can maintain an action thereon. Spann v. Cochran & Ewing, 63 Texas, 240.
The contract being for their benefit, we think Martin & Co. had a right to sue; and having transferred their cause of action to plaintiff in error, he can maintain an action thereon.
Nor do we concur with defendant in error in its fourth proposition, that the damages are too remote and contingent.
The message was sufficient on its face to indicate to defendant that Martin & Co. held a pecuniary claim against Woodworth, that there was danger of its loss through the insolvency of the debtor, and that prompt delivery of the message was necessary to avert such loss.
Such being the case, if defendant in error was guilty of negligence, as charged in the petition, in the transmission of the message, and if as a result of such negligence Martin & Co. lost their debt, then upon sound principles of law and justice plaintiff in error is entitled to recover from defendant in error the full amount of such debt. Tel. Co. v. Sheffield, 71 Texas, 570; Parks v. Tel. Co., 13 Cal., 422.
Of course, before plaintiff in error can recover he must produce such testimony as will induce the court or jury trying the case to believe with reasonable certainty that if the message had been promptly transmitted and delivered to the addressee, Martin & Co. would have obtained an attachment against Woodworth, and thereby secured their debt. The petition alleges that they would have done so.
Delivered October 19, 1892.
Our conclusion is, that as against a general demurrer the petition is good, and the judgment must be reversed and cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded."
219186,Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. O. H. Gorman,1893-01-17,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
The verdict of the jury, which is supported by the evidence, establishes that on the 23d day of November, 1889, appellant negligently set fire to the dry grass and weeds which it ■allowed to accumulate upon its right of way; and this fire spread to the farm of appellee adjoining, and burned over about 80 acres of his pasture, destroying 300 of his rails, 25 posts, 306 fruit trees, 60 grapevines, and 200 blackberry vines, the cash value of all of which amounted to as much or more than the verdict of the jury. Appellee brought this suit for the damage so caused to him, and recovered judgment for the sum of $609.17, from which this appeal is taken.
No complaint is made as to the amount of the verdict, or the sufficiency of the evidence to show negligence on the part of appellant.
Appellant complains that the measure of damage applied by the court below for the destruction of the growing fruit trees and vines was their cash value, when they should have been treated as a part of the land, and its lessened value the proper measure.
A number of decisions in such cases recognize as correct the rule adopted by the court below. Whitbeck v. Railway, 36 Barb., 644; Railway v. Bohannon, 7 S. E. Rep., 236; Montgomery v. Locke, 72 Cal., 75. Other authorities, however, perhaps with better reason, adopt the rule contended for by appellant. 3 Sedg. on Dam., 933, 934. This rule, however, is generally adopted for the benefit of the owner of the land, and not for the one causing the injury, upon the manifestly just ground that by the destruction of a valuable fruit, ornamental, or shade tree, the value of the land may be lessened in an amount many times the value of the tree itself, and in such case the rule adopted by the court below would not furnish adequate compensation.
We believe where the thing injured or destroyed is a part of the realty, the lessened value of the land will come nearer furnishing a just rule in its application to all cases than the one adopted by the court (Express Company v. Real Estate Association, 81 Texas, 81), but we do not believe appellant is in a position to complain that a different rule was applied to it in this case. If appellee is willing to accept the cash value of Ms trees and waive the incidental damage, if any, done by their destructian to his farm, it would seem that appellant should be satisfied. None of the evidence introduced tends in the least to show that the land was not damaged to the extent of the full value of the trees, whatever that might be. One of the methods of proving the damage to the land is by proving the value of the trees taken therefrom. Kolb v. Bankhead, 18 Texas, 228. And where the trees are full grown, and are valuable only as timber, their value, less the cost of marketing them, has been frequently recognized as the proper measure of the actual damage to be allowed for their wrongful or negligent destruction. 3 Sedg. on Dam., 933.
Appellant also complains at the action of the court in giving to the jury, at the request of appellee’s counsel, the following definition of negligence, viz.: “Negligence is the lack of that care which an ordinarily prudent man would exercise in the management of his own affairs.’ ’ The following definition was approved by our Supreme Court in Railway v. Oram, 49 Texas, 346, viz.: “ Ordinary care and caution is such as a prudent man would exercise under similar circumstances.” The definition-to which we are cited by appellant is found in the opinion in Cotton Press Company v. Bradley, 52 Texas, 599, as follows: “Negligence implies generally the want of that care and diligence which ordinarily prudent men would use to prevent injury under the circumstances of the particular case.” We believe the difference in these definitions is so slight that no injury could have resulted to appellant under the evidence in this case. No complaint is made against the finding of the jury on the question of negligence, nor is it contended that their verdict could have been different had this charge not been given.
The court committed no reversible error in calling the attention of the jury in the charge to the values of the several items as alleged in the petition.
We think the judgment of the court below should be in all things affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered January 17, 1893.
Justice Stephens did not sit in this case."
219162,W. N. Barker v. Abbott & Keller,1893-01-24,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
Abbott & Keller were partners, engaged in business as merchants in the town of Mangum, Greer County, Texas. One W. N. Barker attached their entire stock of goods, and also their store house and lots upon which it was situated. The defendant Abbott reconvened, alleging that the attachment wras wrongfully issued, and that his partner Keller refused to join in his plea of reconvention, and asked that he be made a party thereto. It seems that Keller was made a party to the suit. The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of appellee for the benefit of the firm, for the full value of the stock of goods, house, and lot, as claimed by him.
The court below instructed the jury, that the measure of damage appellee would be entitled to recover, in case they found for him, would be the reasonable market value of the property levied upon and seized under the writ of attachment, at the time and place of such seizure, with interest from the date of the levy; and also, at the request of appellee, the jury wrere instructed, that this measure of damage would be “such an amount as the goods and house and lots were reasonably worth on the market at the date they were attached, together with interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent from the date of such levy.” The giving of this charge, we think, will necessitate a reversal of the judgment.
That the value of real estate is not the measure of the damage for levying an attachment thereon seems to be conceded; but appellee attempts to sustain this charge upon the theory that the land referred to was in Greer County, and that the court judicially Imows that no one has title to land in that county, and that therefore the house was personal property; but we think this would be no answer, even if it be conceded that the court did have such judicial knowledge. It will be noted, that the jury were instructed to find the value of the house and lots—not the value of the house alone, disconnected from the lots; and the evidence upon which the finding of the jury was based included the value of the lots. Appellee Abbott testified, that “ the house bought of plaintiff was worth about $100 at Vernon, and after they rebuilt it at Mangum, it and the lots were worth about $600.” If it be conceded that the lots were not the property of appellee, it will certainly not be contended that his right to recover their value is better than if he owned them.
Appellant contends that appellee should not be allowed to maintain Ms plea in reconvention, because it appears therefrom that Keller, one of the partners, refused to join therein; and also, because it is claimed the attachment was with the consent of such partner. As a general rule, it must be conceded that all of the partners should join to recover for the conversion of partnership property. Kirbs & Spies v. Provine, 78 Texas, 353; Tynburg & Co. v. Cohen, 67 Texas, 220; 2 Bates on Law of Part., sec. 1030; 1 Lind, on Part., 279. But one partner can not defeat the rights of his copartner by refusing to join in such suit. Where one of the partners refuses to join, the other can, in some cases, use his name, even against his consent (1 Bindley on Partnership, 271, and authorities cited in note); and in other cases the nonconsenting partner can be made a party defendant. 2 Bates on Part., sec. 1027.
If the attachment was wrongfully sued out, and this was done by collusion between appellant and Keller, for the purpose of injuring Abbott, Keller should be made a defendant in the plea of reconvention, and Abbott restricted to his individual damage, unless he should affirmatively show a case which entitles him to recover the full value of the partnership property thus converted, such as that he had paid partnership debts, and this would be necessary to reimburse him, or some other equitable cause that would entitle him to the proceeds of all the property as against his partner.
If the attachment was wrongfully sued out by appellant without any collusion on the part of Keller, upon the refusal of Keller to join in the plea of reconvention, Abbott should be* allowed to use his name to recover the full amount of damage sustained by the firm.
If appellant contends, that notwithstanding the attachment may have been wrongfully sued out, yet he was caused to take this step for the collection of his debt by the acts of Abbott or Keller, whereby they or the firm are estopped from denying that the attachment was rightfully issued, he should plead such estoppel, and the questions thus raised should be submitted under appropriate instructions to the jury. Scarbrough v. Alcorn, 74 Texas, 358.
If Keller gave his consent to this attachment, knowing or believing that the legal grounds therefor existed, and with no intention to unlawfully injure his partner, but desiring thus to prefer appellant over the other creditors of the firm, we think this would be a protection to him for levying upon the firm property. Schneider & Davis v. Sansom, 62 Texas, 201; Baines v. Ullmann, 71 Texas, 529; Goodbar, White & Co. v. Bank, 78 Texas, 461; Martin Brown Co. v. Perrill, 77 Texas, 199; Blum v. Schram, 58 Texas, 524. But if this consent was given by collusion between appellant and Keller, understanding that the grounds therefor did not exist, then we believe that such consent would be no protection to appellant against the damage caused to Abbott. Bateman Bros. v. Ramsey, 74 Texas, 589; Orr & Lindsey Shoe Co. v. Harris, 82 Texas, 273.
If appellee still desires to recover the value of the house, it will be necessary for him by amendment to allege a state of facts which will show that it was no part of the land, and that the levy was made by taking actual possession, as in case of personal property. Cullers & Henry v. James, 66 Texas, 494.
We think what we have said disposes of all the questions presented in appellant’s brief which are likely to arise upon another trial.
Let the judgment of the court below be reversed and the cause remanded.

219112,J. F. Henry et al. v. D. F. Sansom et al.,1893-01-24,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
October 11, 1888, the appellants, J. F. Henry, Jim Langston, and S. C. Padelford, as executors of the will of F. M. Sansom, deceased, brought this suit in the District Court of Johnson County, against the appellees, D. F. Sansom, J. G-. D. Boyd, M. Sansom, and A. J. Brown. The plaintiffs sought to recover the amount of a promissory note for the sum of $6347.43, with interest at 12 per cent per annum from date, executed by appellees to F. M. Sansom, since deceased, dated August 23, 1886, and maturing August 23, 1888. The plaintiffs prosecute this appeal from a verdict and judgment dated December 28, 1889, reducing the amount of the note to $5594.70, with 12 per cent interest from date of the judgment.
Our conclusions of fact are as follows:
1. August 23, 1886, D. F. Sansom executed and delivered to his uncle, F. M. Sansom, two certain promissory notes; one for $6391.02, with interest at 12 per cent, due one year from date; the other for the sum of $6347.43, with interest at 12 per cent, due two years from date. The former note was executed by D. F. Sansom, J. G-. D. Boyd, M. Sansom, and G-. W. Cotter The latter, which is the note sued on, was made by D. F. Sansom, J. Gr. D. Boyd, M. Sansom, and A. J. Brown. D. F. Sansom was the principal on these notes; the remaining persons were sureties.
2. F. M. Sansom, payee in these notes, died in the fall of 1886, and the appellants herein were duly appointed executors of his will.
3. The true and valid consideration for the foregoing two notes, as contended by appellees, was a pre-existing indebtedness aggregating at the date of their execution about the sum of $10,476. This indebtedness was evidenced, as they contend, by two promissory notes; one for the sum of $8778, dated March 1, 1885, and due March 1, 1886, with 12 per cent interest from date; the other for $150, with similar interest, dated January 1, 1886, due October 1, 1886. Appellees introduced evidence in support of this contention.
4. The consideration for the two notes first referred to, as appellants contend, was a pre-existing indebtedness evidenced by the note for $8778, already mentioned, and by an account for the sum of $3400, with 12 per cent interest, due by D. F. Sansom to F. M. Sansom on a contract and as purchase money for certain stock sold by the latter to the former. The note for $150, referred to by appellees, entered, as appellants contend, in no way into the transaction. Appellants introduced evidence in support of this contention.
5. According to appellees, the two notes executed exceeded the true indebtedness by about $2262.32. According to appellants, the true indebtedness exceeded the amount of the notes by $1494.20.
6. October 6, 1887, in the District Court of Johnson County, the appellants herein as plaintiffs, and as executors of F. M. Sansom, deceased,, brought suit against D. F. Sansom, J. G. D. Boyd, M. Sansom, and G. W. Cotter, to recover the amount of the note first maturing for the sum of $6391.02, with interest as therein stipulated. The defendants named appeared in that suit, and filed an agreement in writing, consenting that the court should render judgment against them for the entire amount of the note, principal and interest. June 11, 1888, judgment was rendered embodying this agreement, and reciting that since the institution of the-suit the defendants had paid on the note the sum of $7000, and it decreed a recovery against the defendants for the remainder, $337.09, with interest at 12 per cent per annum from the date of judgment. The remainder thus adjudged was subsequently paid by the defendant D. F.. Sansom.
7. After the note for $150 matured, the executors of F. M. Sansom. brought suit thereon and recovered judgment. In that suit the defendant D. F. Sansom pleaded in writing that the note sued on had been merged into the two notes executed August 23, 1886, and had been thereby settled, and evidenced no indebtedness against him.
The defendant D. F. Sansom urged two special defenses, by both of which he sought, and by one of which, at least, he obtained, a reduction of the note sued upon. These defenses were:
1. That the notes executed August 23, 1886, including the note in controversy, were in excess of the indebtedness which constituted the consideration for them, and that this excess was due to the mutual mistake of himself and of the payee, F. M. Sansom.
2. The plea of usury.
In response to the first special plea, the court instructed the jury as follows: “ If you believe from the evidence that the note sued on and the note for the sum of $6391.02 heretofore sued on and paid, off, as shown by the evidence, was given in settlement of an indebtedness due by defendant D. F. Sansom to F. M. Sansom, deceased, and that by mutual mistake said two notes were executed for a greater sum than D. F. Sansom owed F. M. Sansom, then you will find what sum D. F. Sansom did owe F. M. Sansom, and you will calculate interest at 12 per cent per annum thereon from the date of the execution of said two notes up to the present time, and add said interest to the sum you find D. F. Sansom owed F. M. Sansom; and you will calculate interest at 12 per cent per annum upon the note sued on up to the present time, add the same to the face value of the said note, and add the amount of the sum paid on the note of $6391.02, upon which there was a judgment, and from the amount so obtained deduct the amount from the sum you shall find, if any, due by D. F. Sansom to F. M. Sansom, and render your verdict for the remainder, if any.”
We are constrained to hold that this instruction, the giving of which appellants assign as error, fails to meet the purpose of .every charge, namely, to afford the jury the means of applying the law pertinent to the facts about which they are to deliberate and which it is their exclusive province to weigh.
In the process of subtraction directed in the concluding clause of the instruction, it is difficult, if not impossible, to infer from the language used what sum was to be regarded as the subtrahend within the meaning of the charge. This confusion doubtless arises on account of a clerical mistake in framing the instruction. The effect, however, is not thereby changed. The jury were left without guidance in their deliberations with reference to this plea of mutual mistake, and if they sought to interpret the charge they were probably misled thereby. We are unable to say, so great was the conflict in the testimony with reference to the main transaction out of which this controversy grows, that this error was not prejudicial to the plaintiffs.
On the defendant’s plea of usury, the court instructed the jury as follows: “ If you believe that defendants were charged on said note (sued on), or that there was included in said note, interest at a greater rate than 12 per cent per annum, then you will ascertain from the evidence what rate of interest was charged per annum or included in the note sued on; and if you find from the evidence that any interest greater than 12 per cent per annum was included in said note sued on, you will in such event, if you so find, deduct from the amount of the face of the notes the amount of interest over 12 per cent per annum so included, if any, and find for plaintiffs the remainder, without interest.”
Appellants complain of this instruction for the reason, in effect, that it was not justified by the plea of the defendants seeking to set up the defense of usury; that while said plea purported in name to be a plea of usury, it in fact was not such a plea, because the facts therein alleged indicate that F. M. Sansom was not a party to the contract to pay usury. The allegations of the plea are, substantially, that at the time of the execution of the two notes of $6347.43 and $6391.02, the calculation of the amount of the indebtedness for which they were substituted was entrusted by F. M. Sansom, who was then very ill, to another person; that the interest charged as usurious was inserted in the notes by the person thus entrusted; that when F. M. Sansom was informed of the excessive interest inserted he “ declared the same to be wrong, and stated that when said notes for $6347.43 and $6391.02 came to be paid and settled, he desired them to be corrected and settled by reference to the notes of defendant for which they were given, and which were at that time inaccessible because sealed up and deposited in a bank at Alvarado, and that defendants should be charged only 12 per cent interest per annum on what was at that time actually due him, as shown by said notes then in said bank;” and that relying solely on said assurance, the defendant D. F. Sansom signed the two notes.
It has been held, “ that in construing the usury laws the uniform construction in England has been, and it is equally applicable here, that to constitute usury within the prohibitions of the law there must be an intention knowingly to contract for or to take usurious interest.” Call v. Palmer, 116 U. S., 98; Jones v. Berryhill, 25 Iowa, 289. The allegations of the plea, as we interpret them, exclude the idea that F. M. Sansom was a party to a contract of usury. To state that he should be deemed guilty of violating the law with reference to usury in the face of a repudiation by him of the insertion in the notes of illegal interest, and a positive instruction by him that the maker of the notes should not be held liable for such interest, is, in our opinion, to state a contradiction. A contract, legal or illegal, can not exist in the absence of assent by both parties thereto.
Appellants’ brief requires that we consider a remaining question, viz.: Will appellees be permitted to dedúet from the note sued on such usurious interest as entered into the note for the sum of $6391.02 first maturing? As we have already seen, the latter note, principal and interest, was reduced to judgment against the appellee D. F. Sansom and others by and with their consent, and this judgment was by him discharged and paid off.
It is settled in this State, that usurious interest voluntarily paid may be recovered, and that it may become the subject matter of a counterclaim in a subsequent proceeding on a different indebtedness against the party paying it. Building & Loan Assn. v. Robinson, 78 Texas, 163; Smith v. Stevens, 81 Texas, 461. Where, however, such usurious interest has been collected by virtue of a legal proceeding, in which the defense of usury might have been but was not urged, it must be deemed to have been forever placed beyond the pale of litigation. The judgment is conclusive against a subsequent plea of usury. Moseley v. Smith, 21 Texas, 441; Black on Judg., 759; Herm. on Estop., 47; Heath v. Frackelton, 20 Wis., 320; Traxel v. Clark, 9 Iowa, 201; Miller v. Clark, 37 Iowa, 325; Togood v. Elliott, 32 Iowa, 543.
We find no error in the action of the court complained of in appellants’ brief with reference to the admission and exclusion of evidence. We deem it unnecessary to discuss other assignments relied upon by appellants.
For the errors pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.

216243,Milmo National Bank v. Louis Bergstrom,1892-10-19,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
This suit was brought by appellant against A. N. Carter and Louis Bergstrom as partners under the firm name and style of A. N. Carter, seeking to recover judgment for the sum of $5216.91 on account of moneys loaned and advanced to said firm. Appellee Bergstrom by answer denied the partnership, and that he was not indebted to appellant. Judgment below was rendered in favor of appellant against Carter, and that it take nothing against appellee Bergstrom. From this judgment appellant prosecutes this appeal.
The evidence shows that Carter and Bergstrom in September, 1881, entered into a copartnership for the purpose of dealing in hides, wool, and produce. The contract of partnership by its terms was to continue in effect for one year from the making thereof.
In October, 1881, the account sued on was opened with appellant by Carter for the purpose of obtaining advances to be used in carrying on the business for the firm. Carter, it seems, was the business manager of the firm at Laredo, and continued to obtain money from the bank until in the spring of 1883, when the account sued on was closed.
It appears from the evidence that at the time the account with appellant was opened Carter informed the officers of appellant’s bank that Bergstrom was a partner in the firm of A. N. Carter, and upon the faith of this information the advances were made.
On the basis of this evidence, it is contended by appellant that at the beginning of the dealings between it and Carter, Bergstrom was actually a partner with Carter: and that credit was extended upon the faith that he was such partner; and although he may have ceased to be a partner after September, 1882 (the time when the contract of partnership terminated), he is liable to appellant, because it had no notice of the dissolution or of the contract of partnership until after the account was closed in 1883.
Upon the other hand, it is contended by appellee Bergstrom that although he was a partner for one year from September, 1881, that at that time the firm was dissolved, and that he is not bound by the statements made by Carter during the year that he, Bergstrom, was a partner; that he was a secret or dormant partner of the firm, and being such, he was not required to give notice of his dissolution with the firm, and is not bound or liable to appellant.
, Other issues may arise out of the evidence, but we deem it only important to notice that discussed.
The seventh paragraph of the charge of the court is as follows:
‘ ‘ If, however, you believe from the evidence that said firm of ‘A. 1ST. Carter ’ ceased to exist on the 23d day of September, 1882, and that plaintiff had no knowledge directly or indirectly that Louisp Bergstrom continued as a partner of said firm of ‘A. 1ST. Carter;’ and if you believe further from the evidence that said Bergstrom did no act directly or indirectly to lead plaintiff or its agents to believe that said firm of ‘A. N. Carter ’ was continued, and that the plaintiff had his dealing with A. 3ST. Carter in his individual capacity, then and in that event the defendant Bergstrom is not liable for any dealings had between the plaintiff and the said A. N. Carter, so made with said Carter in his individual capacity.”
This charge is assigned as error.
When credit is extended to a firm upon the assumption that certain persons comprise the membership, and such assumption in point of fact is correct, the members of such firm are liable to the creditors for future dealings with the firm until notice of dissolution is given to the creditor. Under such state of facts the creditors will not be affected by a dissolution or change in the firm until notice be given or knowledge of such fact has been brought home to them, and the burden of proving such notice or knowledge rests upon the partner claiming such exemption. 17 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 1117, 1118; 2 Bates on Part., secs. 611, 612, 613.
This rule of law does not apply to partners who are regarded in law as dormant or secret partners. For no credit is extended upon the faith of their membership, and they in retiring from the firm are not required to give notice of such fact.
The uncontradicted evidence in the record is, that Carter notified the appellant at the time that the account was opened that Bergstrom was a partner of the firm. Such in fact was his relationship to the firm at that time.
We think this information given to appellant is sufficient to make Bergstrom known to appellant as a member, of the firm, and as to appellant he can not claim that he was a dormant partner.
If it be true that Bergstrom was a member of the firm at the time appellant received information of that fact, it makes no difference from what source received; the effect is to make his connection with the firm known to appellant, and as to it he can not claim that he is a dormant partner. 1 Bates on Part., secs. 151, 153; 2 Bates on Part., secs. 608, 609-623; 17 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 1119-1123.
Delivered October 19, 1892.
Under these rules of law it was error to give the charge complained of, and for this reason we reverse and remand the case.
We find no error presented in appellee’s cross-assignment of errors except that which relates to the admission in evidence of the books showing the account sued upon.
We are not prepared to say that the copy of the account falls within any of the exceptions to the general rule that requires the production of the books of original entry, but we apprehend that this question will not arise upon another trial, because the books will probably be produced.
Judgment reversed and cause remanded.

216196,William Reed et al v. Volney Cavett et al.,1892-10-19,"KEY, Associate Justice.
Appellees brought this suit in the form of trespass to try title, and described the premises sued for as follows:
“ In Bell County, Texas, and out of the W. C. Sparks league of land: Beginning on east line of a 369 acres survey made for Mrs. Evetts out of the W. C. Sparks league, 587 varas south 19 west from the northeast corner of said Evetts survey, stake and pile of rocks for corner, from which mesquite marked X bears north 57{: west lj- varas and a mesquite hears south 51|- west 4-|- varas; thence south 19 west 2182 varas to stake in south line of W. C. Sparks league, from which elm marked X bears south 71 east 13-j- varas, an ash marked X bears south 35-j: east 5 varasf thence south 71 east 1716 varas to original southeast corner W. C. Sparks league; thence north 19 east 2182 varas-to stake and stone mound in east line of said survey; thence north 71 west 1716 varas to place of beginning, containing 675 acres of land.”
Appellants, who were defendants in the court below, pleaded a general denial and not guilty. The record shows that it was mutually admitted in open court that appellees have title to the W. C. Sparks league along and down to the south line thereof, and that the appellants have title to the Joseph West survey and a portion of the Alexander McKenzie survey abutting on the Sparks league; that the Sparks league is the older survey; and the only matter in issue was the true position on the ground of the south boundary line of the W. C. Sparks league, and all the evidence related to this one issue.
The court instructed the jury, in effect, that if appellants were in possession of or claiming any of the land north of the true south line of the Sparks league, to return a verdict for the plaintiffs; and if not, to find for defendants.
The jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiffs, upon which the court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs for the title and possession of the land sued for, describing it exactly as it is described in plaintiffs’ petition. This judgment directs that a writ of possession shall issue against the defendants.
The defendants’ motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial being overruled, they have appealed.
The fourth and eighth assignments of error are as follows:
“4. The verdict of the jury is contrary to law. It decides nothing. It leaves the case just where it began, with the field notes in the Sparks title as the only guide to the officer who.may be charged with the duty of putting plaintiffs in possession of the land described in their petition and in the judgment.”
“ 8. The judgment is contrary to law, in that it does not determine the position of the south boundary line of the W. C. Sparks league, which was the only matter in issue in the case, and the only matter to be determined by the verdict and judgment.”
These assignments are well taken. Though nominally an action of trespass to try title, the agreement of the parties and the evidence made the case a boundary suit only. In such a case the verdict and judgment should definitely fix and establish the location of the line in dispute with reference to some known object then in existence, concerning the identity and locality of which there is no dispute. If the plaintiffs’ petition describes the particular land in'dispute and the line in controversy in this manner, then a general verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs under appropriate instructions will be sufficient. If it does not, then the charge ought to direct the jury to, and by their verdict they should, designate the line, or a corner from which it could be surveyed and fixed, by stating its course and distance from such established and undisputed object.
Taking the description of the land as given in plaintiffs’ petition by itself, and there is not necessarily any uncertainty as to the boundaries. But the Sparks league was located in 1834.
The ravages of time have caused the disappearance of many of the objects of identity called for in the original field notes; the bearing trees that fixed the locality of the southwest corner are gone; and applying these field notes or those in the petition to the ground now leaves room for dispute as to the correct location ■ of its south line. Hence this suit, the very purpose of which is to determine where said line is: and the judgment should definite^ fix its locality with reference to some object permanent in its nature, easily found, and now existing on the ground.
Delivered October 19, 1892.
When this is done the matter in issue is settled, and an officer can execute a writ of possession without having to try the question of boundary himself.
But if the judgment follows the description in the petition, without any further identification of the south line of the Sparks league, it leaves room for the same uncertainty and dispute that existed before, and the officer executing the writ would have to determine as best he could where the south line of plaintiffs’ land is.
In Jones v. Andrews, 72 Texas, 5, this identical question was considered and determined in accordance with the views we have expressed.
The court gave the jury the correct rules of law that govern in determining questions of boundary. The seventh section of the charge is assigned as error; but, barring the failure to direct the jury to fix by .their verdict the line in dispute, we think the charge of the court is correct.
The charge, of the court being correct and full on the subject to which appellants’ special charge related, there was no error in refusing to give it.
For the error above indicated, the cause is reversed and remanded.
jReversed and remanded."
219069,"V. C. Holland, Executor, et al. v. A. J. Farthing",1893-01-24,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
This case having been tried in the court-below by the judge without a jury, his conclusions of fact, which we find sustained by the evidence, may be briefly stated as follows:
On October 2,1873, J. A. Truelove, then an unmarried man, purchased the lot in controversy from J. M. Lindsay, paying therefor the sum of $37.50. The deed was first made to said Truelove, but on the same day he had Lindsay to erase his own initials and insert those of his maiden sister, E.'J. Truelove. The deed when so changed appeared upon its face to convey to the grantee, E. J. Truelove, for a cash consideration, the title to said lot in fee simple. At the time of the making of this deed, however, it was expressly agreed between J. A. Truelove and his sisters-E. J. Truelove, and N. J. Townsend (the last named being a widow), that the said E. J. Truelove should hold said lot in trust upon the following terms, to-wit: That she and her said sister should have the right to live thereon as their home during their lives, or such less time as they might see proper to occupy it, but upon their death or abandonment of' the same as a home, it was to be the property of the said J. A. Truelove.
In 1887 E. J. Truelove died, leaving a will bequeathing said lot, one-half to J. A. Truelove and the remainder to appellant Holland, as her executrix, to be used in improving a lot in the Gainesville cemetery. Upon such death, however (the said N. G. Townsend having long previously abandoned the lot), the said J. A. Truelove took possession of same, asserting his right thereto under the terms of the trust herein before set forth, and conveyed it to appellee Farthing.
Appellants claim title under the will and as heirs of said E. J. Truelove. The court found the trust in favor of J. A. Truelove sufficiently established by the evidence, and rendered judgment in favor of appellee claiming thereunder.
That an express trust is not within our statute of frauds, and can therefore be established -by paroi evidence, has long been settled by repeated decisions in this State. Mead v. Randolph, 8 Texas, 191; Bailey v. Harris, 19 Texas, 109; Leakey v. Gunter, 25 Texas, 400; Vandever v. Freeman, 20 Texas, 334; Clark v. Haney, 62 Texas, 511; Norfleet v. McCall, 80 Texas, 236; Brotherton v. Weathersby, 73 Texas, 471; Neyland v. Bendy, 69 Texas, 711.
While we have been unable to find any case in this State in which the agreement creating a trust contemplated the occupation of the land by the trustee during his life, we are unable to distinguish such an agreement, in principle, from that recognized as valid in a number of cases-cited above.
In the case of Johnson v. Johnson, 16 Minnesota, 512, the facts were ■quite similar to those developed by this record, and in that case the court found against the trust; but we think the reasons given for the decision under the statute of that State would go far to maintain its validity in this. The statute of that State provides, “ that no trust or power over or concerning lands, or in any manner relating thereto, shall hereafter be created, granted, assigned, surrendered, or declared, unless by act or -operation of law, or by deed or conveyance in writing, subscribed by the parties,” etc. Brown on Statute of Frauds, fourth edition, 606; and in the case above referred to, the court, after stating the facts, says: “ This state of facts does not give rise to any express trust in favor of the plaintiff, because there is no writing declaring the same; and there is no implied or resulting trust, because the statute declares, that when a grant for a valuable consideration shall be made to one person and the consideration therefor shall be paid by another, no use or trust shall result in favor of the person by whom such payment shall be made; but the title shall vest in the person named as the alienee in such conveyance, subject only to the provisions of the next section.” As we have no statute similar to that in Minnesota, this case, so much relied upon by appellants, we think instead of being an authority in their favor is strongly against them.
By reference to our conclusions of fact, it will be seen that we are of opinion that the evidence of the trust in this case was sufficient to sustain the finding of the court below in its favor. Baylor v. Hopf, 81 Texas, 637.
What we have said sufficiently indicates our views upon the other questions raised in the assignments of appellants.
Let the judgment of the court below be in all things affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered January 24, 1893."
216195,D. C. Freeman v. Joe Hamblin and Wife,1892-10-19,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
This is an injunction suit, brought by the appellees Joe Flamblin and his wife Lula Hamblin on the 29th of February, 1888, against E. L. Antony, A. G-. Wilcox, and the appellant D. C. Freeman, and A. J. Lewis, the sheriff of Milam County,'to enjoin the enforcement of judgment in suit No. 1827, rendered in the District Court.
The father of plaintiff Joe Hamblin owned a tract of 420 acres of land, upon which he lived, and which upon his death was inherited by Joe Hamblin in 1882. After the marriage of Joe Hamblin with Lula Hamblin they moved on the land as a home, where their three children were born and where they have since lived. A few months after their marriage the plaintiffs sold and conveyed off of the south end of the surve)r 54 acres, and received in exchange from one Chamberlain 64 acres of land adjoining the unsold balance.
On the 12th day of August, 1884, Joe Hamblin conveyed to J. R. Hardeman what was estimated in the deed as 220 acres of the 420 acres, beginning on the north boundary line, a base line supposed by them to be 490 varas long and running south 19 west 2425 varas. The base line was really some 645 or more varas in length, so that allowing the side lines to govern, about 276 acres were inducted in the sale. The deed contained the following explanation: 11 The intention of these presents being to convey to said Hardeman all of my said tract of land (the 420 acres) save and except a homestead of 2.00 acres, measuring from the south boundary line thereof.”
Before the deed was made, Hamblin and Hardeman stepped off the distance from the north boundary the estimated distance to include the 220 acres, and 11 came out,” as Hamblin testified, 11 where I claim the north line of the 200 acres to be. *' * ""* I did not make the deed to Hardeman. I got II. N. Roberts to do so. I carried him the stepping of myself and Hardeman and suppose he made the deed accordingly. Hardeman and myself did not survey the land, but we intended to run the land out afterward.”
Sometime after the deed to Hardeman, Antony and Wilcox had an execution against Hamblin levied on the land described in the deed to Hardeman, under which it was sold and purchased by them. At this time none of the parties knew where the lines would place the survey, or that they would include any of the 200 acres reserved as a homestead, or now claimed as Hamblin’s homestead.
The conveyance by Hamblin to Hardeman was made to place the land beyond the reach of his creditors.
After the purchase by Antony and Wilcox they brought suit in the District Court of Milam County against Joe Hamblin and James Hardeman for the land; they appeared and answered (Hamblin disclaiming), and on the 20th of November, 1886, Antony and Wilcox recovered judgment against both defendants for the land, cancelling the deed from Hamblin to Hardeman. Writ of possession issued on the 10th of January, 1887, and was returned executed by placing the agent of Antony and Wilcox in possession, without disturbing Hamblin’s possession of the homestead claimed; the officer and, it seems, all the parties being ignorant of the locality of the survey — that the side lines would include Hamblin’s dwelling house, stable, barn, tenement houses, the family graveyard, the spring, and about 20 acres of cultivated land.
D. C. Freeman, appellant, who had purchased the land from Antony and Wilcox and their vendees, having ascertained that his survey according to calls would include such part of the homestead of Hamblin, the same being occupied by him and tenants, on November 26, 1886, in vacation, applied to the district judge for an alias writ of possession, setting-out the fact that he had not been placed in possession. To this motion Joe Hamblin appeared, substantially setting up the facts stated in his bill for injunction — his homestead rights in the property, and the mistake,of the parties as to the locality of the 220 acres; praying that his homestead be protected — 200 acres north from the north line of the 54 acres sold to Chamberlain, a base of 645 yaras, the side lines 1750-J varas — and that the judgment in favor of Antony and Wilcox be so reformed as not to conflict with the homestead. Mrs. Hamblin was not a party to any of the foregoing proceedings.
On the 29tli day of November, 1887, this injunction suit was brought and filed by Hamblin and wife, claiming homestead on the 420 acres tract 200 acres north of the Chamberlain 54 acres, setting up the foregoing-facts, and asking for relief as before stated.
The motion for alias writ of possession and the petition for injunction were heard by the district judge on the 29th day of February, 1888, at the same time, and both granted «in chambers. The cause was finally tried October 24, 1888, and judgment rendered upon verdict for Hamblin and wife against all the defendants for their homestead as claimed by them, perpetually enjoining the enforcement of the judgment in so far as it interfered with the title and possession of the homestead.
Some general observations as to the law applicable to this case will save us the trouble of a separate consideration of many special questions raised by the assignments of error.
The husband can not convey the homestead without the consent of the wife, and without her joint conveyance executed and acknowledged by her as prescribed by the statute; nor can he sell a part of the actual homestead so used and occupied without such joint -conveyance.
What property constitutes the homestead is sometimes a question of fact and law, but the homestead, whatever constitutes it, is not subject to disposition by the husband alone. The joint act of both husband and wife can not create any lien upon it or subject it to forced sale for debt. These principles are elementary. Under some circumstances the homestead may be designated by the head of the family, as where there is an excess of land in a rural homestead, but the husband can not exercise this prerogative so as to defraud the wife or to renounce the actual homestead. Medlenka v. Downing, 59 Texas, 32; Jacobs, Bernheim & Co. v. Hawkins, 63 Texas, 1; Kempner v. Comer, 73 Texas, 196; Land and Loan Co. v. Blalock, 76 Texas, 85.
The most solemn renunciation of the actual homestead in use as such by husband and wife, executed in forms required in a conveyance of her separate estate, could not subject it to a deed of trust or a mortgage. Kempner v. Comer, 73 Texas, 196; Land and Loan Co. v. Blalock, 76 Texas, 85.
It follows a fortiori that the hnsband alone can not by declaration or acts of sale renounce the homestead, and so subject it to execution.
It is in effect claimed by appellant in this suit that the husband can by his individual conveyance, and without the knowledge or consent of the wife, designate the homestead so as to exclude a great part of it in actual use, even the home itself, and to subject the same to execution.
This lie can not do. The deed to Hardeman has no force in this suit further than as a designation of the homestead, and it can not be used for that purpose. Freeman does not claim under it, but under judgment setting it aside. As a designation of the homestead, its calls, as we have seen, will actualty exclude a great part of the homestead of the family; besides the calls were made by mistake, which would not be binding.
All the acts done by the parties at the time of and in connection with the deed as a designation should be considered. The actual measurement of Hamblin and Hardeman by stepping the distance — the very act of designation, in so far as it can be so called — “ came out” and terminated about the gate on the west line, which leaves the homestead as now claimed by the appellees untouched. It is wholly immaterial that Hardeman did not get 220 acres of land by the deed. The deed as such secured no right, and the land it purported to convey was recovered from him, because it conveyed nothing.
The judgment against Hamblin and Hardeman for the land including a part of the Hamblin homestead was not binding upon Mrs. Hamblin, because she was not a party to it and was in no way affected by it, and because the homestead right was not involved. The contention of the appellant that the homestead rights of the parties were concluded by the judgment for the land amounts ""to this: “A judgment creditor can have the homestead sold under execution against the husband without the knowledge of the wife, purchase the property at the sale, then, by recovery of the property in suit against the husband, obtain a valid title to the homestead against both husband and wife, when the right of homestead was not in issue.”
This proposition can not be maintained. The judgment would not be res adjudicata against the wife or in any manner disturb her homestead rights, more especially when she is ignorant of any effort to divest her of homestead title. It is of no consequence that the fee of the property was in the husband. Her homestead right attached to this separate estate as inviolably as it would to community property.
We can not say either that the husband, Hamblin, was bound as to homestead rights by the judgment, or that it could be pleaded against him as the head of the family. He did not know that the land sued for embraced the homestead or any part of it, nor did the parties plaintiff in the suit. No one, so far as the record shows, supposed that it did. In the deed by Hamblin to Hardeman, from which the field notes were taken in making the levy, he reserved his homestead out of the 420 acres inherited from his father, making a mistake in basing it on the south line of the survey instead of the north line of the 54 acres sold to Chamberlain, but evidently claiming homestead in the 420 acres survey. This, connected with the fact that he and Hardeman in measuring off the land to be conveyed to the latter did not reach the homestead or intrude upon it, establishes the fact that he did not know, and that the parties recovering the land of him did not know, that the homestead was involved in the suit. The petition for injunction set up this mistake by appropriate averments, and it was sufficient to defeat the enforcement of the judgment against the homestead as represented by Hamblin himself. The homestead issue was not made in the suit, because it was thought not to be involved. The judgment did not conclude the parties upon the issue now in suit.
Hamblin was not compelled and the court could not compel him to include the 64 acres convejred to him by Chamberlain in selecting his homestead. It has never been used as a part of the homestead and has never been selected for such purpose. No designation of the homestead had ever been made that is binding on Hamblin and wife until the institution of this suit, and of this defendant can not complain. Nothing had ever been done until this suit was filed but to acquire the excess of homestead in the 420 acres after deducting the land sold to Chamberlain. Hamblin and wife had the right to designate their homestead in this suit.
The deed to Hardeman was relevant to the issue of designation or not at the time it was made, by which alleged designation the appellant has from the beginning claimed that Hamblin and wife were bound; and so was the evidence of Hardeman and Hamblin as to stepping the estimated distance on the west line of the land conveyed.
The testimony of P. S. Ford, that the injunction and the order for alias writ of possession were considered and granted at the same time, if not material, was harmless. If there was any point in the alias at all, in so far as the homestead question was concerned, the testimony was material to show that the injunction, if perfected by bond, was intended to supersede the order authorizing the alias writ of possession. The orders of the court were of the same date.
Delivered October 19, 1892.
We think, however, that the homestead rights of Mrs. Hamblin could not be determined on application for a writ of assistance by the judge in chambers. She was in no way a party to the proceeding; and if she had been, her rights could not have been concluded by such a proceeding in chambers.
Article 2875, Revised Statutes, does not apply to this suit.
We have now disposed of every assignment of error called to our attention in appellant’s brief, and have found no error in the judgment of the court below or in the ridings.
We are of the opinion the judgment should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.
Affirmed."
219242,J. T. Brackenridge et al. v. W. E. Cobb et al.,1893-01-24,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
There is involved in this suit the title to about 3000 acres of valuable land situated in Cooke County. One J. W. Wilson is the common source of title. The land was first levied on and sold under execution against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, J. W. Wilson, and others, as the property of J. W. Wilson, under a judgment in favor of Thomas Trammell & Co. Appellees, W. E. Cobb and J. J. Lang, claim under this judgment, levy, and sale. Appellants claim under a judgment lien and a subsequent levy and sale thereunder, against, substantially the same parties. This judgment was obtained by appellant the First National Bank of Austin, and the abstract thereof was recorded in Cooke County subsequent to the levy and prior to the sale under which appellees claim. There was a trial without a jury, and as the court’s conclusions of fact contained in the record cover all the material issues of fact and are sustained by the statement of facts, we here adopt them as our conclusions of fact in this case.
Appellant’s first assignment of error presents the question, whether the record of the abstract of the judgment in favor of the First National Bank of Austin is sufficient to create a lien, on account of the manner in which the name of said bank was indexed. The name seems to have been written in the alphabetical index kept by the clerk for that purpose under the name “Plaintiff,” and under the letter “B,” as follows: “Bank, First National, of Austin.” The court below held this to be insufficient. He, however, found as a fact that the judgment had been indexed.
The statute makes the indexing of the names of both plaintiffs and defendants essential to the creation of a lien, but does not prescribe exactly how this shall be done. Mr. Black, in his work on Judgments, section 406, lays it down as the purport of decisions, that “ a sufficient degree of accuracy is attained in such indexing if an intending purchaser (for example), exercising a reasonable degree of care and a reasonable degree of intelligence in making a search, could not fail to be apprised of the existence and character of the judgment.” We are, however, cited to no case directly in point, and have been unable to find any; and as the question is one of importance, and not necessary, as we think, to the disposition of this appeal, we leave it undecided.
The second, third, and ninth assignments of error, submitted together by appellant, attack the levy and sale under which appellees deraign title, because of the issuance at the same time of executions to Wise, Cooke, Wichita, Archer, Baylor, and Wilbarger Counties, and because of certain levies made under these executions subsequent to the levy in question. We are of opinion that the matters complained of by these assignments were but irregularities, which did not render the levy and sale void; and that inasmuch as the court found that they did not tend to depreciate the price of the property sold, they would not constitute sufficient ground to set aside the sale, especially after the lapse of more than four years. Freem. on Ex., secs. 49, 50; Railway v. Morris, 67 Texas, 692; Earle v. Thomas, 14 Texas, 583.
We also conclude that the proposition asserted in said assignments, that the judgment must be held satisfied because of these subsequent levies, under the facts disclosed by the record and found by the court below, can not be sustained.
We are of opinion that the inconclusive circumstances relied upon to show a satisfaction of this judgment were not sufficient to require a finding that it had been satisfied in full at the time of the sale, and hence that the sale was void. Freem. on Ex., sec. 269.
The twelfth assignment insists that the purchase by appellees at a trustee’s sale under the deed of trust in favor of Gregory, Cooley & Co. (which deed of trust was held to be void), amounted to an abandonment of their title under the execution sale. Our conclusion upon this assignment is, that the purchase at the trustee’s sale, being in compromise of the litigation about the validity of the deed of trust, was intended to strengthen and did not have the effect to destroy the title already acquired.
The fifth assignment of error pronounces the execution sale void because the sheriff who executed the writ was brother-in-law to one of the defendants therein, to-wit, D. H. Phillips. In the absence of a statute declaring such a disqualification, we conclude that the act of the sheriff was not as if done without any official authority and hence void. For a review of the authorities on this question, see Barker v. Renick, 43 New Hampshire, 235; see also Mechem on Public Officers, sections 518, 524.
It follows from these conclusions, that appellants did not acquire by their purchase under a subsequent execution sale under a judgment lien which, if valid, was subsequent to the execution lien under which appellees claim, a superior title to that of appellees; and therefore that appellants can not recover the property in controversy. They contend, however, if not entitled to this relief, that appellees should be decreed to hold the land in trust for appellant bank, and that equitable relief be granted. This prayer is not accompanied by any offer to do equity; and we are of opinion, that in view of the delay in bringing this suit and of the changed condition of the parties interested, under the facts found by the learned judge, the vacation of the execution sale under which appellees deraign title would be manifestly inequitable, and that no error was committed in refusing equitable relief. Freem. on Ex., sec. 307a.
This disposes of all the other assignments of error.
The judgment will therefore be in all things affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered January 24, 1893.
A motion for rehearing was overruled."
216306,Ben. Kiolbassa v. James Raley,1892-10-19,"KEY, Associate Justice.
The statement of facts in the record in this case discloses the nature of the litigation, which statement is as follows:
“ The estate of Thomas Martin, who died in May, 1886, unmarried, was administered upon in the Probate Court of Bexar Count)-, Texas, and .7. F. Mullaly was duly appointed as administrator on January 23, 1889.
“ The only property of Thomas Martin was his homestead, on which he lived at the time of his death and previous thereto, with his children,. one of whom was a minor, but without a wife, who had died long before.
“ This homestead was sold in course of administration and a balance of §171.15 shown to be left in the hands of the administrator for distribution to the creditors.
“ Two claims were presented against the estate and allowed by the administrator and approved by the court; and as the estate was not sufficient to pay off both these claims, hence arose this contention between the two claimants.
“ One of the claims, that presented by James Raley, the appellee, was a promissory note given by Thomas Martin, the deceased, on May 15, 1884, payable six months after date and secured by a deed of trust on the homestead, on which Thomas Martin, deceased, resided at this time with his minor child and other children, but without a wife.
“ On February 15, 1889, this claim was presented and allowed by the administrator for the full amount of §303. This claim was examined and approved as a fourth class claim by the probate judge on March 19, 1889, and ordered to be paid in due course of administration as a fourth class claim.
“The other claim, that presented by Ben. Kiolbassa, appellant, was a judgment recovered by Ben. Kiolbassa in the Justice Court against Thomas Martin on March 13, 1883, on which judgment execution issued on April 17, 1883, and not thereafter; and the judgment not being satisfied, was then duly recorded so as to preserve a valid lien against any property that Thomas Martin might have subject to execution.
“ This claim was presented and allowed by the administrator for the full amount of $157.36 on July 8, 1889. And this claim was further examined and approved by the county judge for the full amount as a just and true claim, and ordered to be paid in due course of administration as a claim of the third class.
“ The administrator advertised for final settlement at a subsequent term of the County Court held on Monday, January 19, 1891; and Ben. Kiolbassa, the appellant, holding a third class claim against the estate-, made application, asking that the administrator pay over all the sum that may be in his hands, less costs of this court and administration, to satisfy this claim, being a third class claim, and therefore having a preferred right to other claims against this estate.
“And also James Raley, the appellee, presented his fourth class claim, with deed of trust securing it, asking an order of distribution and that his claim might be paid. At the same time J. F. Mullaly, the administrator, came in and filed his report for final settlement, asking for its approval and an order of distribution.
‘ ‘At this hearing the County Court ordered the funds in the hands of the administrator to be paid in satisfaction of James Raley’s, the appellee’s, claim, to which ruling the creditor Ben. Kiolbassa excepted and gave due notice of appeal.”
We adopt the above as conclusions of facts.
The District Court sustained the action of the County Court, and rendered a similar judgment, from which this appeal is prosecuted.
The assignments of error are as follows:
“ 1. The court erred in holding that the order of the County Court ordering Kiolbassa’s claim to be paid in due course of administration as a third class claim was not final and conclusive; but that the claim can be reopened and reclassified at a subsequent term of the court.
“ 2. The court erred in holding that the claim of James Raley was a secured claim and should be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the property belonging to the estate; because the facts show that this was the only property belonging to the estate, that the funds in the hands of the administrator were not sufficient to pay both Kiolbassa’s and Raley’s claims, and that the Kiolbassa claim was the only claim classed as a secured claim, or as a lien on the property of decedent.
“ 3. The court erred in holding that the claim of James Raley should have priority of payment over the claim of Ben. Kiolbassa; because the facts show that Kiolbassa’s claim is a third class claim and Raley’s claim is a fourth class claim.
“ 4. The court erred in holding that the deed of trust given to secure Raley’s note was a good and valid mortgage on the property of decedent, Thomas Martin; first, because the facts show that the only property belonging to decedent was his homestead, on which he lived with a minor child at the time the deed of trust was given; second, because the fapts show that at the time- the claim on the note was allowed by the administrator and approved by the Probate Court the note was barred by the statute of limitations.”
So much of our statute classifying claims against estates of decedents as has application to this question reads as follows:
“Article 2037. The claims against an estate shall be classed and have priority of payment as follows:
üí -x-
“3. Claims secured by mortgage or other liens, so far as the same can be paid out of the proceeds of the property subject to such mortgage or other lien; and when more than one mortgage or lien shall exist upon the Same property the oldest shall be first paid; but no preference shall be given to such claim secured by mortgage or lien further than regards the property subject to such mortgage or other lien.”
Under this statute a claim against an estate may be a claim of the third class as to a portion of the property, because secured by a lien thereon, and of the fourth class as to the remainder of the estate. And if it be true, which we do not decide, that an order or judgment of a Probate Court declaring that a claim is secured by a lien on certain property, and is therefore a third class claim against the estate as to said property, is a final judgment and binding upon the owners of other claims against the estate, unless set aside or appealed from, still we do not think that appellant’s claim comes within that category.
His claim was a judgment recorded in Bexar County, so as to create and preserve a lien on any real estate Thomas Martin owned in said county subject to forced sale. The Probate Court approved it and ordered it paid in due course of administration as a third class claim, but did not adjudge it to be a lien on Martin’s homestead or on any other property.
We think that in ordering it to be paid as a third class claim the County Court never intended to declare this claim to be a lien on Martin’s homestead.
It should not be construed to mean more than this: That if there was any of Martin’s estate to which appellant’s judgment lien would under the law attach, then, as to such property, this claim should have priority.
We conclude that the first assignment of error is not well taken. Eastham v. Sallis & Ralston, 60 Texas, 576; Mortgage Co. v. Jackman, 77 Texas, 622.
The second assignment involves substantially the same question that the first does, and need not be further considered.
The third assignment, alleging that the court erred in according appellee’s claim priority over appellant’s, because the facts show that appellant’s is a third and appellee’s a fourth class claim, is not sustained by the facts. To have warranted the court below in classifying his claim as one of the third class as to the fund in controversy, he should have shown that the land the sale of which produced the fund was subject to forced sale, and therefore to his judgment lien at the time said judgment was recorded, or at any rate at the time Martin executed the trust deed to secure appellee’s debt.
Appellant failed to make such showing, and this assignment of error is not well taken.
As to the fourth assignment of error, it is settled that an unmarried surviving spouse can mortgage the homestead and that the courts can enforce such mortgage. As to the first of these propositions, see Lacy v. Rollins, 74 Texas, 566; Smith v. Von Hutton, 75 Texas, 626. As to the second proposition, see Harle v. Richards, 78 Texas, 80.
As to appellant’s proposition based on the assumption that the land sold was community property, and that the purchaser acquired only a half-interest therein, it is enough to say that the purchaser paid his money for Martin’s interest in the land, and whether he got title to only one-half, all, or none is wholly immaterial in this case.
Delivered October 19, 1892.
Nor is there any merit in the contention that appellee’s claim was barfed by the statute of limitations when presented for allowance. The statute of limitations was suspended for one year after Martin’s death, and the claim was presented just four years and three months after its maturity. Rev. Stats., art. 3218.
None of the assignments of error are well taken, and the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.
Affirmed."
216239,Martin McCarty and Wife v. T. J. Brackenridge,1892-10-19,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
This is a suit by J. T. Brackenridge, the appellee, against Martin McCarty and his wife Josephine McCarty, on a promissory note for $2500 and interest, and to foreclose a lien on parts of lots 7 and 8 in block 122 in the city of Austin, and the improvements thereon.
The petition alleges that the plaintiff is the owner and the holder of the note; and besides many explanatory allegations concerning the execution of the note and the transaction between Brackenridge and McCarty creating the alleged lien, the petition is in the usual form.
The following are the conclusions of fact and law filed by the presiding judge, upon which judgment was rendered for plaintiff according to the prayer in the petition, from which McCarty and his wife have appealed:
Findings of Fact. 1. That prior to August 1, 1883, defendant Martin McCarty and Page McDannell were partners, engaged in the wholesale liquor business in Austin, Texas, and that on or about said first day of August they by mutual consent dissolved said partnership, and by the terms of said dissolution said McCarty agreed to pay all the liabilities of the partnership, amounting to about $17,000, and he took the stock and fixtures, worth about $22,000, and continued the business.
2. That a short time before said dissolution of said partnership said McCarty and his wife sold their homestead in Austin, Texas, to G-. W. Littlefield for $10,000, and said McCarty had received as part payment therefor said Littlefield’s purchase money note for $5000, which was valuable commercial paper.
3. That at the time of the dissolution of said partnership said McCarty agreed with said McDannell that after paying off the balance due on the homestead sold to Littlefield, he would use the remainder of the proceeds of the sale in his business to protect McDannell against his liability on said $17,000 firm indebtedness.
4. That about the time of said dissolution of partnership McCarty contracted for the purchase of the property in controversy from T. J. Moore and wife, of San Antonio, Texas, acting by their agent, M. B. Sweeney, in Austin, Texas, for $2500.
5. That after said dissolution, and before the consummation of said purchase, said McDannell objected to McCarty investing any of his means in a homestead until he had paid off the liabilities of said firm which he had assumed; whereupon McCarty and plaintiff entered into the followingparol agreement, to-wit: That McCarty should temporarily withdraw $2500 from his business and pay Moore and wife for the property, and have them make a deed to plaintiff, conveying the property to him, and that after thirty days from that time plaintiff would on demand advance to McCarty $2500 to replace the amount so withdrawn from his business, and that said deed was to be delivered to plaintiff, and he was to hold the deed to said property and have a lien thereon until McCarty repaid him the $2500 and interest, when he was to convey to McCarty.
6. That said McCarty’s business was in such a condition that he could not have permanently withdrawn the $2500 to pay for the property from his business without endangering the success of his said business and impairing his commercial standing; and the agreement he made with the plaintiff, as hereinbefore stated, enabled him to procure said property, subject to plaintiff’s lien thereon, without such results following.
'7. That on August 1, 1883, in pursuance of the aforesaid contract of sale between Moore and wife and McCarty, Moore and wife executed and had properly acknowledged a deed conveying said property to said McCarty, which, on the 3rd day of August, 1883, was by said T. J. Moore delivered to McCarty in said McCarty’s office in Austin, Texas, and said McCarty then and there paid said Moore for said property the sum of $2500 in cash, which he had just received from J. II. Raymond & Co.’s bank by discounting the aforesaid Littlefield note for $5000.
8. That said McCarty, soon after receiving said deed from Moore and wife to him, delivered the same to M. B. Sweeney, with instructions to return it to said Moore and wife and get them to execute another in lieu thereof, conveying the property to plaintiff; which was done, and on the seventh day of August, 1883, said Moore and wife executed and had properly acknowledged a deed conveying said property to plaintiff, which they returned and caused to be delivered to said Sweeney, and which, about the middle of said month, was delivered to plaintiff and was duly recorded in the land records of Travis County.
9. That on the 24th day of August, 1883, plaintiff made the following endorsement on said deed:
‘ ‘ Know a,ll men by these presents, that Justin McCarty has on this 24th day of August paid me $2600, for which 1 am to make him a deed to the within property whenever he desires, and in the meantime this can be used as a basis of credit in the First National Bank for $2000, all expenses of making deed and acknowledging, etc., to be paid by McCarty.
“ J. T. Brackenridge.”
This endorsement was not a contract or agreement between plaintiff and McCarty, but was a voluntary statement in writing made by the plaintiff for the protection of McCarty in the event of plaintiff’s death before McCarty got the $2500 as agreed upon to replace the money withdrawn from his business to pay for said property, but McCarty knew this endorsement was on the deed before he got the money.
10. That on the 18th day of September, 1883, McCarty called on the plaintiff for the §2500 in pursuance of the parol agreement, and plaintiff caused the same to be paid to him by the First National Bank of Austin, which he used in his business.
11. That at the time of the receipt of the said §2500 as aforesaid said McCarty executed his promissory note for same, payable to said First National Bank, of which plaintiff was and is now president, with 12 percent interest and 10 per cent attorney fees, etc., which note was renewed for the same amount and on substantially the same terms November 20, 1883, and March 24, 1884. On January 27, 1887, the note of March 24, 1884, was renewed for same amount, payable thirty days after date, with same interest, etc., and made payable to J. T. Brackenridge, president, at the First National Bank, Austin, Texas.
The first of these notes has this statement in it: ‘1 Deed for lot where I live collateral security.” The last note, January 27, 1887, contains this statement: “ Purchase money for house and lot now occupied by Dr. Weisselberg, in the city of Austin, Travis County, Texas.” It was shown by proof that when the first note was executed McCarty resided on the property in controversy, and when the last note was made Dr. Weisselberg, as McCarty’s tenant, resided upon it.
12. That as between plaintiff and said bank, of whose board of directors plaintiff was and is president, it was understood that said agreement between him and McCarty was his individual transaction, and he is liable to said bank for said $2500.
13. That plaintiff had no notice of the execution or delivery of the deed from Moore and wife to McCarty until after the latter failed in business in February, 1887, and he let McCarty have the $2500 in good faith, believing from McCarty’s statements and acts that the deed from Moore and wife to him was the only one they had executed to convey said property, but he did have notice that they were purchasing said property for a homestead, and that they were occupying it when he let McCarty have the money.
14. The defendants took possession of the property in controversy about the 1st of September, 1883, and were occupying it as a home when plaintiff paid McCarty the $2500, and have so continued to occupy it most of the time since then; but defendant Martin McCarty did not claim it as a homestead as against plaintiff’s said debt until after his failure in business in February, 1887.
15. The defendant Josephine McCarty had no knowledge of said transaction between plaintiff and her husband, and of the deed being made by Moore and wife to plaintiff, until after her husband’s failure in business, but thought the property had been deeded to her said husband, and she has claimed it all the time as her homestead, and does so now.
Conclusions of Law. 1. That plaintiff is entitled to judgment against defendant Martin McCarty for $2500, with 12 per cent interest thereon from the-day of-, 1887, to date, and 10 per cent as attorney fees on the first amount, and for costs.
2. That the deed from Moore and wife to Martin McCarty, as against the rights of plaintiff under the contract made with said McCarty, was and is inoperative, and can not be made the basis of defendants’ homestead rights, because plaintiff furnished the $2500, believing from the acts and representations of said McCarty that the title to said property had been conveyed from said Moore and wife to him, and without any notice of the execution of said deed to McCarty.
3. That defendants can not, as against plaintiff’s right under said contract and agreement with Martin McCarty, assert homestead right under the deed to plaintiff, because the effect of said agreement was to subrogate plaintiff to the rights of a vendor of the premises.
4. It is therefore held that plaintiff has a lien on said premises to secure payment of said money, paramount to the homestead rights of defendants, and judgment will be rendered against said Martin McCarty as aforesaid, and against both defendants, foreclosing said lien on said property.
Appellants’ first assignment of error is: “The court erred in the fifth paragraph of the facts found by the court, in finding that plaintiff and the defendant Martin McCarty made a parol agreement before the consummation of the purchase of the property in controversy by said McCarty from T. J. Moore and wife, by the terms of which said McCarty was to temporarily withdraw from his business the $2500 to pay Moore and wife for the property and cause Moore and wife to make a deed conveying the property to plaintiff, and that after thirty days from that time plaintiff would advance to said McCarty $2500 to replace the amount so withdrawn from his business, and that said deed was to be delivered to plaintiff, who was to hold the deed to said property and have a lien thereon until said McCarty should repay the amount with interest, when he was to convey it to McCarty; because the great preponderance of the testimony and circumstances in this case show that no such agreement ever existed between plaintiff and defendant, and show that if any such agreement ever did exist it was changed to another and entirely different agreement before any money was advanced to defendant.”
In treating the foregoing assignment we will discuss several of the principal questions presented in the record.
Under the view we take of the case the court below found the material facts to be determined, and was correct in finding that the money, $2500, was furnished by plaintiff under the agreement as found by the court and not under any change of agreement.
It occurs to us that the first and most important question in the case is as to the time the parol agreement was made before the payment to Moore by McCarty, and before the delivery of the deed to McCarty, or, as expressed in the court’s finding, before the consummation of the purchase by McCarty.
A reference to some of the testimony will show that it supports the finding.
Page McDannell says the sale of the property by McCarty and wife (their old home) to Littlefield was taken into consideration when witness (who was the former partner of McCarty in the wholesale liquor business) sold out his interest in the business. The agreement between him and witness was that the proceeds of the property, sold to Littlefield were to be used in the business. McCarty assumed the debts, about $17,000, upon dissolution, but McDannell was bound for them. The stock was worth about $22,000. After selling out to McCarty, McDannell says he found out that he was about to buy another place, which would at once become a homestead. Witness went right to him and objected to his taking the money out of his business until the firm’s indebtedness was settled. McCarty told witness that he had gone so far he did not see how he could help it; had contracted for the property and was expecting the deed every day. Witness suggested that the deed be returned and another deed by Moore and wife be made to plaintiff. McCarty made no objection, and said he would do it. Witness then hunted up plaintiff, told him what the object was and all about it, when plaintiff and witness went to McCarty’s store and plaintiff talked to McCarty. As McCarty had already said he would fix it up that way, the witness considered his object accomplished, and left and did not know how it was fixed up.
The witness does not give the date of this transaction, but says it was very soon after the dissolution, which was. on August 1; could not state the day of the month.
He says McCarty is mistaken in saying that he had the deed when witness went to him; that he has the dates confounded; that it would have been nonsense to advise him to have the deed made to Brackenridge if it had been already received and the money paid.
Brackenridge is not certain when he had the first conversation with McCarty about the trade; says it was about the 1st of August. They did not agree on that day. McCarty wished Brackenridge to take the property, which the latter declined to do. He says: “I think probably I saw him again the next day, and it was probably three days afterward that he saw me in the bank. What he wanted there was merely to consummate the agreement before made. He wanted to know what I would do for him certainly, and I told him I would take the deed myself for the property from Moore and wife, and hold it and wait on him for the purchase money; that if he was compelled to take the money out of his business I would wait on him as the vendor of the property. That was the second or third time he came to see me. There had then been an agreement between us. At the second interview I had an agreement with him about the same thing. He said he had a contract with Moore and wife for the property, a house and lot; that he would be compelled to take and pay for it, but that under his agreement with McDannell he could hot pay for it; that it would cripple him in his business, and he wanted me to furnish him relief and assist him.”
The contract or agreement is then stated by the witness. By reference to other transactions, he fixes the time for the contract on the 1st of August, 1883.
The testimony shows that the Moore deed to McCarty was executed in San Antonio, and Moore came with it to Austin on the 3rd of August, 1883. The trade had been negotiated by M. B. Sweeney, a land agent.
Sweeney testified that Dr. Moore came to Austin on the 2nd or 3rd of August, 1883, and was in his office about 10 a. m. Moore told him he had come to close the trade. He, Sweeney, left Moore in his office and went to see McCarty. When he informed McCarty that ‘ ‘ Dr. Moore was here ready to close the trade,” he, McCarty, was standing at the desk and seemed a little confused. He said, “ I am not ready.” “ Well,” I said,11 Mac., you had better see to this. ’ ’ Witness went back to his office and told Moore what McCarty said; when Moore requested witness to tell McCarty that the trade had to be closed that day or he would take the property off the market and not sell it at the price; witness went to McCarty and delivered the message, when McCarty said he would see what he could do. Witness returned to his office; and while going to McCarty’s store the third time he met McCarty. * * * I said, “ Mac., have you made it ?’ ’ He answered, 11 Major Brackenride has agreed to let me have the money to pay for the place; a better friend I never had,” etc.
The witness then proceeds to narrate the subsequent facts of the payment of the $2500 to Moore when the deed was delivered to McCarty, and says: “At the time of the sale, as my memory serves me pretty strongly, McCarty left the deed in my office, and told me the deed was to be made to Major Brackenridge. So I retained the deed, copied it, inserted Major Brackenridge’s name, and sent it to Dr. Moore to sign.”
Witness is certain, by reference to the entry of his commissions on the trade, that the money was paid and the deed delivered on the 3rd of August. Afterward the deed from Moore and wife to Brackenridge came back from San Antonio to .1. W. Robertson; it was delivered by him to Sweeney, who delivered it to Brackenridge.
McCarty is positive in his testimony that the first deed was delivered to him on the third of August, and that he made the agreement with Bracken-ridge on the sixth; says it was August 6 he handed the deed back to Sweeney with instructions to have a new deed made to Brackenridge, and thinks it was the ninth the second deed came back. It was dated August 7.
We have reviewed this testimony at some length, as the question raised by it is of more importance to the decision of the case than other findings of the court upon the facts.
We conclude that the testimony warranted the court in finding that the agreement with plaintiff and McCarty was made before the purchase money was paid to Moore, and before the deed was delivered to McCarty. It was upon the agreement as found by the court that Bracken-ridge furnished the money to McCarty for which the latter executed his note for the amount, $2500, tó the First National Bank, of which plaintiff was and is the president. The note is dated the 18th of September, 1883, and the other notes, including the one sued on, are renewals of the first. The last note is of date January 27, 1887, and states upon its face that it is “ purchase money for house and lot now occupied by Dr. Weisselberg in the city of Austin,” etc., which is the same conveyed by Moore and wife. The first note was due sixty days after date, and before the signature contains the following: “ Deed for lot where I live collateral security.”
At this date McCarty was living on the place, having moved upon it on the 11th of September, 1883. He purchased the property for a home, but could not obtain possession until the 11th of September, it being occupied by a tenant.
Brackenridge knew nothing of the deed to McCarty at the time he advanced the money. His and McCarty’s agreement was that he was to hold the deed made to him, not as a deed of conveyance, but as a lien on the house and lot to secure the payment of the amount to be advanced by him, and when McCarty repaid him he was to convey the property to him.
Construing the transaction as found by the court, the deed to McCarty ■encumbered the property with a parol trust as expressed in the agreement. The legal effect of the transaction was as if the deed had been at first made by Moore and wife to Brackenridge to take effect as a mortgage for the security of the purchase money, upon the payment of which Bracken-ridge was bound to convey to McCarty the property. The withdrawal of the money from his business by McCarty, under the circumstances of his agreement with McDannell and the condition of his business., was a sufficient consideration to bind Brackenridge to furnish the money. The agreement to make the mortgage was valid and enforceable; the money was furnished by Brackenridge, a performance that consummated all prior agreements and gave them vitality from the beginning. Hicks v. Morris, 57 Texas, 658.
The sending of the first deed back to Moore after its delivery, and having one executed to Brackenridge, was but a compliance with a legal agreement made with him before the first deed was delivered. A parol agreement may be made to execute a mortgage in the future, where the agreement is supported by a valuable consideration, and the agreement itself will be treated as a mortgage in a court of equity.
The question of homestead does not embarrass the case or interfere with the contract. The husband can encumber the homestead in the acquisition of it, and homestead rights will not obtain so long as the encumbrance remains. The husband can renew the encumbrance or change it at discretion, so he does not defraud the wife. Farmer v. Simpson, 6 Texas, 304; Morris v. Geisecke, 60 Texas, 635; White v. Shepperd, 16 Texas, 163; Clements v. Lacy, 51 Texas, 150; Gillum v. Collier, 53 Texas, 592; De Bruhl v. Maas, 54 Texas, 464.
A mere lender of money for the purpose of buying a homestead has no lien unless there was at the time an agreement to that effect. Euhl v. Kauffman, 65 Texas, 723.
In the case at bar there was an agreement for lien, which must be discharged before a homestead can be acquired against it.
The foregoing disposes of the important issue in the case, but others must be considered.
We do not think, as insisted in the second assignment of error, that the sixth finding of fact by the court was unsupported by the evidence. The evidence warranted the conclusion that McCarty’s business was in such condition that he could not have permanently withdrawn therefrom the $2500 without endangering its success and impairing his commercial standing. McCarty substantially so represented the facts to Brackenridge in negotiating the agreement for the loan. His agreement with his partner, and the interview between them upon this subject, also supports the finding. It is also true, as found by the court, that the agreement with the plaintiff enabled him to procure the purchase money for the house and lot without injury to his business.
Appellants contend that the court committed error in finding that the endorsement of Brackenridge on the deed to him was not a contract with McCarty, but a voluntary statement made for the protection of McCarty in case of the death of Brackenridge before the money was furnished as per agreement. The deed was left with plaintiff before the money was drawn, and there was nothing to show the nature of the transaction and McCarty’s interest in the property. Brackenridge did not know of the former deed to McCarty. Brackenridge fully explained the meaning of the endorsement — that it was for McCarty’s protection in case he should die; that McCarty would be entitled to a conveyance of the property from him if he did not draw the money to replace in his business. Evidently the statement that McCarty had deposited with Brackenridge or paid him $2500 was a fiction, but it would afford a consideration and a good reason for a reconveyance of the property to McCarty by Bracken-ridge’s representatives in case of his death. In other words, it indicated that McCarty was entitled to a conveyance unless he used the credit provided for in the memorandum.
The fourth assignment complains of error in the court’s finding that McCarty, on the 18th of September, called upon plaintiff for the $2500 in pursuance of the parol agreement; that plaintiff caused it to be paid to him by the First National Bank, and that defendant used it in his business. The finding is in accord with the testimony. The note was made payable to the bank, but Brackenridge was bound to the bank for the amount, and it was regarded as his obligation by him and the bank authorities. This view of the case is consistent with the facts indicating the very contract with all the parties, and it is so stated by direct testimony. The bank did not loan any money to McCarty. Brackenridge was personally responsible, and he and the bank so regarded it. He was regarded as the owner of the note and its security.
It may be as well to say now, in anticipation of the assignment of error, that the legal conclusion to be derived from the facts so found constituted Brackenridge the real owner of the note and the beneficiary of the security. The suit was properly so brought, and sustained by the testimony.
Either the legal or equitable owner may maintain an action on a promissory note. Butler v. Robertson, 11 Texas, 142.
The bank and Brackenridge could have any understanding as to the liability and ownership that suited them, without violating any right of MeCarty. But it is undoubtedly true that McCarty under the facts was liable to Backenridge, and the latter had a good cause.of action against him, as made in the petition and by the proof.

219152,F. J. Westmoreland v. J. T. Richardson,1893-01-31,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This action was brought by appellee in the usual form of trespass to try title, to recover possession of a half-section of school land situated in Hardeman County. Appellant answered by plea of not guilty. There was a trial by a jury, with the verdict in favor of appellee. The record contains a very meager statement of facts— but a skeleton, in fact, which indicates that much of its substance was lost in the preparation; many things called for and directed to be inserted having been omitted. In this unsatisfactory state of the record, we doubt if appellant could require us to pass upon questions which depend for their solution upon an investigation of the statement of facts. We think, however, that enough is stated, in a general way, to warrant the following conclusions:
1. On the 7th day of April, 1890, appellee, a single man, actually settled upon the land in controversy with a view to the acquisition of title by purchase from the State under the Act of 1887, amended in 1889, providing for the sale of school lands.
2. He continued to reside upon this land until about August, 1890, when he was ejected by a writ of restitution, issued out of the County Court of Hardeman County on a judgment therein rendered, in an action of forcible entry and detainer pending on appeal from the Justice Court, in favor of appellant.
3. On the 29th day of May, 1890, appellant and appellee made separate applications to purchase this land from the State.
4. Appellant never actually settled on the land until after appellee was dispossessed by the writ of restitution in August; though prior to the settlement of appellee lie had, in the year 1888, enclosed and put in cultivation about 100 acres of the land, when he settléd on an adjoining tract, supposing that he was upon the land in controversy. After learning of his mistake, which was sometime prior to the settlement of appellee, he did not move on the land until the time stated above.
5. It does not appear that either of the applications to purchase was accepted or rejected.
The important question in this case arises upon the exclusion from the evidence of a certified copy of the judgment of the County Court under which the writ of restitution mentioned in the conclusions of fact was issued. This copy of the judgment was offered by appellant in bar of this action as res adjudicata. The certified copy is not found in the bill of exceptions nor in the statement of facts; but it is recited in the bill of exceptions, that this judgment was rendered in a suit of forcible entry and detainer, in which John T. Richardson was adjudged to be guilty of forcible entry and detainer against F. J. Westmoreland, in making said entry on the 7th day of April, 1890, upon the land in controversy. This testimony was excluded on the objection, that the suit of forcible entry and detainer was pending on appeal in the Court of Appeals. We are of opinion that this objection should not have been sustained. Thompson v. Griffin, 69 Texas, 143; Rev. Stats., arts. 2461, 2462.
The question of difficulty is, whether, notwithstanding the insufficiency of the objection, material error was committed in excluding the evidence. Beyond the statement that Richardson was adjudged guilty of making said forcible entry on the 7th day of April, 1890, we are not informed by the record what issue was tried in the forcible entry and detainer suit. The statute defines a forcible entry to be an entry without the consent of the person having the actual possession. Art. 2441.
It may be that Westmoreland was, by virtue of having 100 acres of the land enclosed, held to be in the actual possession, and that Richardson, "" having entered without his consent, was on that ground alone adjudged to be guilty. It may be that under the complaint filed in that case the issue sought to be litigated in this suit could not have been tried. The question submitted for determination in this action of trespass to try title was, whether at the date of the respective applications to purchase the land from the State, appellee or appellant was an actual bona fide settler within the meaning of the Act of 1887, and the amended Act of 1889, which made actual settlement a prerequisite to the acquisition by purchase from the State of the land in controversy. If it be conceded that this issue was triable in the action of forcible entry and detainer, it is not made to appear in any way by this record that it was the issue actually tried therein. Our conclusion is, that in the state of the record brought here by appellant, we would not be warranted in reversing the judgment on account of the exclusion of this evidence. Reddin v. Smith, 65 Texas, 26.
It follows from the conclusions of fact announced above that the assignments of error raising other questions are without merit. Joiner v. Johnson, 19 S. W. Rep., 522; Baker v. Millman, 77 Texas, 46.
The judgment will therefore be affirmed.

219083,W. R. Buford v. Lark Smith,1893-01-31,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
In August, 1889, the Commissioners Court of Cooke County established a second class public road known as the Rock Bluff and County Line road, the northern terminus of which is at Red River, on land owned by appellant. Since the establishment of said road, appellee, without any license from the Commissioners Court of Cooke County, has been engaged in operating a ferry across Red River, landing his passengers upon that part of appellant’s land condemned for use as a public road under the laws of this State as aforesaid, and appellant instituted this suit to recover the land, and also to enjoin appellee from its use for said ferry purposes. The court below gave appellant judgment for the land, but refused the injunction; and from the judgment refusing the injunction appellant prosecutes this appeal.
This question has been so ably and exhaustively treated in an opinion delivered by Justice Dillon, while a member of the Supreme Court of Iowa, in the case of Prosser v. Wapello County, 18 Iowa, 327, that it would be a waste of time upon our part to attempt to add anything to what is there said, and we shall content ourselves with copying at length from that opinion as follows:
‘ ‘ This brings us to the next question, and that is, whether the location of a county road on the land does, to the extent of its width on the bank of the river, deprive the land owner of his riparian rights as above defined.
“And here we feel compelled to yield our doubts to the almost if not quite uniform current of authority, and to hold that it does not. The argument is this: By the location of the road the public acquire simply the right of way over the soil; the bare right of passage and its incidents, nothing more. Deaton v. Polk County, 9 Iowa, 594; Trustees v. Railway, 3 Hill (N. Y.), 567; Sir John Lade v. Shepherd, 2 Strange, 1004; Mayor v. Ward, 1 Wils., 110, 111.
“ The property or freehold still remains in the owner of the land; how completely so, the case last cited, with others there referred to, strikingly illustrate.
1 '■ This question has arisen in several cases, and among others in Pipkins v. Wynns, before cited (2 Dev., N. C., 402), and which overruled Rayner v. Dowdy, 1 Murph., 279. Speaking of this subject, Henderson, C. J., says: 1 For the uses and purposes of a highway it (the highway) is the sovereign’s—the public’s; for all other purposes it is the former proprietor’s. The right of using it as a landing place for a ferry has never been taken from him; and although there is scarcely a perceptible difference between stepping from a boat on the land and stepping from land to land, yet that has never been taken from the former proprietor for such purposes, as he has never been compensated for the right (limited as above stated) of transporting persons across the watercourse, as that was not considered when the price of taking the land for a highway was fixed; and although it is of little value without the franchise, yet the ownership of the land gives him the preferable right to call for the franchise when the ferry becomes necessary. This right is valuable, for, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, the sovereign must grant it to the owner, as sovereigns are bound to be just. * * * If it be asked, what is to be done if the owner of land, where a ferry is necessary, refuses to receive the franchise, it is answered, to pay him for the land and grant it to another. * * * Let it not be taken for a road and used as a ferry.’ It was accordingly held, that compensation must be made to the owner of the fee for the use of the soil for the ferry right, although there is a public road leading to the river on both sides.
“And such is substantially the decisions in Tennessee (Memphis v. Overton, 3 Yerger, 387) and in Pennsylvania. Thus in Chambers v. Furey, 1 Yeates (1792), 167, it was decided that the dedication or laying out of ground as a public road gave no right to the defendants, the owners of a ferry, to land upon or receive freight from the plaintiff’s freehold on the banks of a navigable river, without his consent. That the owner of a ferry has no right to land his passengers or boat on a public highway without the consent of the owner of the soil, see, also, Cooper v. Smith, 9 Sergeant & Eawle, 31 (1822); not even (it was held in a subsequent case) at the terminus of a highway between high and low water mark. Chess v. Manoun, 3 Watts, 219 (1834); and see Bird v. Smith, 8 Watts, 434; also, the thoroughly considered case of Pearsall v. Post, 20 Wendell, 111-131, in which the doctrine of the Pennsylvania cases above cited is approved. There is ,a dictum contra per Bailey, Judge, in Peter v. Kendal, 6 Barnewald & Cresswell, 703.
“ Whether the decision in Chess v. Manoun, above cited, is reconcilable with McManus v. Carmichael, 3 Iowa, 1, is a question of some difficulty. See, on this subject, Prosser v. Davis, infra.
‘ ‘ Without committing ourselves to the entire correctness of all the positions taken in these cases, which we have referred to as illustrating the subject, we feel free in holding:
“1. That the dedication or taking of land for a public highway does not, in cases where the owner retains the fee and the public have only an easement, deprive such owner of his preferable right to a ferry, if one is established.
2. That a ferry license to a stranger will not authorize him, against the consent of the owner, or without compensating him therefor, to use the termini of such highway, certainly above high water mark (see on this point, Prosser v. Davis, infra), for the purpose of fastening boats and of receiving and discharging freight and passengers. Such a use is not a public use, so much as it is a use by the licensee or holder of the franchise for his own gain and advantage. Like the use of an ordinary road for railway purposes, such a use for ferry purposes would be an additional burden or servitude, for which compensation must be made to the owner. Milburn v. Cedar Rapids, etc., 12 Iowa, 246, 259. Forcibly illustrative of this question, see Mahon v. Railway, 24 N. Y., 658; Carpenter v Railway, 24 N. Y., 655; Wager v. Railway, 25 N. Y., 526; Bissell v. Railway, 23 N. Y., 61; Fletcher v. Railway, 25 Wend., 462; Davis v. Mayor, 14 N. Y., 526; Williams v. Railway, 16 N. Y., 97-106, reviewing Chief Justice Gibson’s opinion, contra, in Philadelphia v. Railway, 6 Whart., 25; and see, where owner parts with fee, Aldrich v. Wallace, 8 Dana (Ky.), 289; 16 N. Y., 97; arguendo, Wager v. Railway, 25 N. Y., 526-533.”
This decision was approved by the same court in the case of Prosser v. Davis, 18 Iowa, 367, and it is there held, that on the application of the riparian owner the proprietor of a ferry will be enjoined from landing his boat on the land of such owner that has not been condemned to that use and the owner compensated therefor.
It follows, therefore, that we are of opinion that the court below erred in not granting the injunction as prayed for by appellant. It will be borne in mind that appellee did not claim to be licensed by the Commissioners Court of Cooke County to operate a public ferry at the terminus of this road, but only claimed the right to operate a private ferry, regulating his own tolls, he being at the time a citizen of the Indian Territory., and we are therefore not called upon to decide whether or not the condemnation of the land for the purpose of a public road since article 4436 of our Revised Statutes has been in force will authorize the operation of a public ferry in connection therewith under a license from the Commissioners Court of the proper county. This last named article, after authorizing a riparian owner to operate a public ferry with the consent of the owner of the land on the opposite shore, provides, “if such consent can not be obtained he may apply to the Commissioners Court for the establishment of a public road from said opposite shore, and said court shall act on said application as in other cases.’ ’
In the case of Tugwell & Madison v. Eagle Pass Ferry Company, 74 Texas, 480, our Supreme Court strongly intimates, if it does not decide, ' that the condemnation of a püblic road from such opposite shore would, under this statute, authorize the owner of such public ferry to land his boat upon the land so condemned.
In this ease we only decide that the operator of a private ferry can not, without license from the proper Commissioners Court, land his boat without the consent of the riparian proprietor upon his land, even where it has been condemned for the purpose of a public road under our statute.
As establishing that the estate and rights acquired by condemnation proceedings for a public use in this State do not extend beyond the purpose for which the condemnation is made, see O’Neal v. The City of Sherman, 77 Texas, 182; Lyon v. McDonald, 78 Texas, 71.
For the error above indicated, let that part of the judgment of the court below which refuses the injunction prayed for by appellant Buford, and adjudges the costs against him, be reversed and here rendered, granting such injunction against appellee Smith, and adjudging appellee to pay the costs of this appeal and of the court below; and in all other respects let the judgment rendered by the court below be affirmed.

216266,International & Great Northern Railway Company v. Martin Mahula,1892-10-26,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
The appellee instituted suit against the appellant in the District Court of Medina County, Texas, on the 17th day of May, 1888, to recover the alleged value at St. Joseph, Missouri, of two carloads (49) horses shipped on July 26, 1887, by appellee from New Braunfels, Texas, to St. Joseph, Missouri, alleging their value at St. Joseph, Missouri, to be $1960. Appellee alleged, that appellant failed-and refused to deliver said horses to appellee upon his demand at St. Joseph, Missouri, although appellee had tendered to appellant all freight and charges which appellee claimed for transportation and feed, etc.
Appellant answered by general denial, and that stock was shipped upon two special contracts at a reduced rate of freight made on July 26, .1887, by appellee and Kenneth D. Wheatley with the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, which was at that time the lessee of the appellant.
The said shipment was made as, and was in fact an interstate shipment.
That the conditions of said contracts stipulated that in casé of loss or damage of any kind for which the Missouri Pacific Railway Company should be liable, then and in that event said company should only be required to pay the value of said horses so damaged at New Braunfels on date of shipment, and that the value of said horses when shipped at New Braunfels, Texas, did not exceed $19 per head.
That appellant, though a common carrier and bound to the public for torts committed by its lessee, the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, generally, could only be held liable for the torts of its lessee committed in the performance of some duty appellant as such owed to the public. That as such common carrier appellant did not owe it to the public to make interstate shipments, and if appellee saw fit to enter contracts for interstate shipments of his horses, then he must look to the lessee for his damages, and that he has no right to hold appellant responsible for such damages caused by its lessee, and that appellant is only liable in such cases for the damage done while said horses were being transported upon its own line.
Trial was had and a verdict and judgment were rendered for the appellee against the appellant for $1525.
The court erred in refusing to give to the jury the following charge requested by appellant:
“ The defendant asks the court to instruct the jury that, if they believe from the evidence that the Missouri Pacific Railway Company made and entered into the contracts set up by the defendant to ship these animals beyond the line of the International & Great Northern Railway, then the International & Great Northern Railway is not liable for any damages that occurred to plaintiff’s horses beyond the line of its road.”
The evidence in the record shows that appellee entered into two written contracts of shipment with the Missouri Pacific Railway Company to ship horses from New Braunfels, Texas, to St. Joseph, Missouri. There is a clause in each contract limiting the liability of the carrier to its own line.
The cause of action is based upon the refusal of the railway company to deliver the horses to appellee after they had arrived at St. Joseph, Missouri.
While the evidence is not clear in showing that the horses in controversy were the same covered by the two contracts of shipment with the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, and which were delivered at St. Joseph by that road, still it is sufficient to entitle the appellant to have submitted to the jury the issues raised by the special charge.
The number of horses, the date of shipment, the place where shipped from, the place of destination, and the names of the consignors and consignees as stated in the written contracts of shipment correspond with the evidence of appellee and witness Wheatley.
The witnesses for appellant speak of the horses being delivered at St. Joseph, Missouri, by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company. Such in effect is their testimony on the subject.
Under these facts, it should have been left to the jury to determine whether these horses were covered by the written contracts of shipment ■ with the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, and whether they were carried into St. Joseph, Missouri, by that road.
Such evidence would have a tendency to show that the horses were covered by the contracts of shipment with the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, and that they had passed out of the possession of appellant at the time such delivery was refused appellee, and that at such time they had gone into possession of another carrier.
If this should be the effect of the evidence, the appellant would be entitled to the benefit of the clause in the written contracts exempting the carrier from liability for damages resulting on other than its own lines. Such exemption made by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company in the written contracts of shipment would result to the benefit of each carrier over whose lines the horses may be transported. McCarn v.

219207,O. G. Denson v. John McCasland,1893-01-31,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This is the suit of a landlord against his tenant to recover rents and the value of supplies, etc., in the total sum of $362.65.
The crop was seized under a distress warrant and replevied by the tenant.. In his answer he set up certain offsets, and also pleaded in reconvention for damages. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the landlord for $36.35, upon which the court entered judgment in favor of the landlord for that amount, but, without stating any reason for so doing, adjudged the costs against him. From this judgment O. Gr. Denson, the landlord, has appealed.
By the second assignment of errors, he complains of the judgment of the court, in that the costs of the suit were adjudged against him, and asks that on this ground the judgment be reversed and rendered.
Our conclusion is, that inasmuch as he was successful in the suit to the extent of the amount recovered, and as his demand was reduced to an amount which would not have been within the jurisdiction of the court,. by a counter-claim and not by payment, no payment even being alleged, that he should have recovered his costs. Rev. Stats., art. 1421, 1428. It is true that article 1434 provides, that the court may, for good cause, to be stated on the record, adjudge the costs otherwise than as provided in the preceding articles of the chapter. The court does not seem to have proceeded under this article, as no reason is stated for adjudging the costs against appellant; and we see no good reason why the costs were not adjudged against appellee and the sureties on his replevy bond, as provided in article 3117.
There is another assignment, which calls in question the correctness of the court’s ruling in excluding testimony, but if this assignment should be sustained, it would lead not only to a reversal of the judgment, but also to a remanding of the cause, which is requested by appellant only in the event he can not have the judgment reversed and rendered.
The judgment will therefore be reversed and here rendered for appellant against appellee and the sureties on his replevy bond for the amount recovered below, with costs.

216204,E. A. Bates v. W. W. Van Pelt,1892-10-26,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
The appellee, W. W. Van Pelt, brought this suit April 20, 1889, in the District Court, against the appellant, E. A. Bates, for damages to his homestead, one acre of ground, 75 varas square, fronting on Garden Street, alleged to be a public street of the town of Batesville, in Zavala County. The petition shows that plaintiff has but one way to and from his premises, by and on Garden Street on the east, and that defendant obstructed this way b)r digging two ditches, one in the street next to his lot, and one across the street near the southeast corner of the same, both connecting with the “ mother ditch” on the north. Plaintiff asks for $600 actual damages and $1000 exemplary damages, and prays that defendant be compelled to fill up the ditches and open the street.
Defendant answered by plea in abatement, that the ditches were constructed by authority of the Comanche Irrigation Company, a private corporation, incorporated February 12, 1876, and that the ditches were for legitimate purposes of irrigation under the charter, and are the property of the company; that the corporation is still in existence; that its business is required to be conducted by its president and board of directors; that defendant is and at the time of the institution of the suit was president of the company, whose principal office, by its charter, is at Uvalde, Texas; that if plaintiff has been damaged as alleged, it was caused by the company and not by"" the defendant, who is not liable in his individual capacity, and he asks to be dismissed with his costs.
There was no order making the irrigation company a party defendant, nor was there any order in relation to the plea in abatement, except to overrule the plaintiff’s exceptions thereto.
The evidence showed that the ditches were dug for the irrigation company, as alleged by defendant, and were the property of the company.
The verdict of the jury was for plaintiff for $100 actual damages, and “ that the ditches complained of in plaintiff’s petition be destroyed.” Judgment followed for plaintiff for his damages, and that the ditches complained of be filled up and destroyed, and unless this is done by the defendant in twenty days after adjournment of the court, the clerk is ordered to issue a writ to the sheriff requiring him to do so. Defendant appealed.
Appellant insists, that the judgment of the court below is unauthorized because it requires defendant to fill up the ditches and remove obstructions over which he has no control or ownership.
We think in this respect the judgment went too far and was erroneous.
It is true defendant would be personally liable in damages for the wrong committed by him, and he could not defend the wrong by showing that he was acting for and at the instance of the irrigation company. Both would be liable for any tort committed by him as its agent, and the action could be maintained against each separately or jointly. Cool, on Torts, 133; 1 Beach on Priv. Corp., sec. 253; Railway v. Hackney, 83 Texas, 410.
Ordinarily the company would not be liable for the malicious acts of its servants. 2 Beach on Priv. Corp., secs, 442-444.
It seems from defendant’s answer that he thought the law would excuse him for the alleged trespass, because he was acting for the company in the discharge of his duties as its president, and that the company had a license from the State to clo the acts complained of, by its charter. A chartered company is liable for its torts, and has no more license to commit them than a natural person. The irrigation company was bound to so construct its works as not to trespass upon the rights of adjacent landowners, and its servants or officers committing such wrong would also be personally liable.
Delivered October 26, 1892.
But there being no controversy of the fact that the ditches were the works and property of the company, and that defendant had no control of them in his individual capacity, the court exceeded its powers in commanding that the ditches be filled up and destroyed.
The petition asked for such relief, and when the answer by plea in abatement set up the facts the company should have been made a party defendant. The company was to be affected by the relief prayed for, and it was a necessary party. The court’s judgment was erroneous.
On the question of jurisdiction, it should be said that the petition was sufficient to give jurisdiction to the District Court.
There was no plea that the amount claimed was fraudulently alleged to obtain jurisdiction, and without such allegations and a finding sustaining them the court had the power to hear the cause and render judgment for any amount found to be due. Ratigan v. Holloway, 69 Texas, 468; Dwyer v. Bassett. 63 Texas, 274; 66 Texas, 58.
Because of the error in the judgment, it should be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is so ordered.

216216,Hugh McGuffin et al. v. P. S. Sowell,1892-10-26,"KEY, Associate Justice.
This suit was brought by appellee, P. S. Sowell, as assignee of the firm of Roby & Nichols, to recover the value of certain personal property alleged to belong to him as such assignee and to have been seized and converted by appellant McGuffin as sheriff of Guadalupe County, etc. Appellee’s title to said property and right to recover for its conversion depends upon the validity of a deed of assignment, which reads as follows:
“ The State of Texas, Guadalupe County. — Know all men by these presents, that whereas the firm of Roby & Nichols, which said firm is composed of W. S. Roby and M. R. Nichols, residents of said State and county, are justly indebted in divers sums of money, which the said Roby & Nichols are unable to pay in full, to different creditors whose names are stated in the annexed list; and whereas the said Roby & Nichols desire to make a fair distribution of their property and assets among such of their creditors as will consent to accept their proportional share of their estate and discharge them from their respective claims in accordance with the provisions of the statutes;
“ Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises, and the sum of Si to us in hand paid by P. S. Sowell, of said State and county, the said Roby & Nichols doth by these presents bargain, sell, release, and set over unto the said P. S. Sowell all their real and personal estate, other than that which is by law exempted from execution.
“ To have and to hold unto him, the said P. S. Sowell, and his successors, in trust, for the benefit of creditors of the said Roby & Nichols aforesaid; and the said P. S. Sowell on his part agrees faithfully to perform his duties as assignee in accordance with the statute concerning assignments for the benefit of creditors.

November 27, 1886. <«C. L. Arbuckle,
“ County Clerk Guadalupe County.”
To this instrument was attached a list of creditors of Roby & Nichols, with the amounts due each.
November 11, 1886, M. R. Nichols, one of the two partners composing the firm of Roby & Nichols, executed this assignment by signing the firm name thereto and acknowledging it, as shown by the officer’s certificate.
Appellee accepted the trust and qualified as assignee on the same day, November 11,1886. On the following morning, November 12, 1886, the firm of Meyer & Bulte, defendants in the court below and appellants in this court, sued out an attachment against Roby & Nichols and had the same levied on the stock of merchandise, which appellee had taken possession of under the above deed of assignment. Appellee recovered judgment in the District Court for the value of these goods, and from that judgment this appeal is prosecuted.
After the levy of the attachment, and on the same day, W. S. Roby signed and acknowledged the assignment.
Previous to the execution of the assignment by Nichols, Roby verbally gave his consent for Nichols to make the assignment.
It was not shown whether or not the firm owned any real estate, nor what, if any, individual property not exempt from forced sale was owned by either member thereof.
Appellants contend:
1. That the deed of assignment does not upon its face purport to convey all the property other than exempt property belonging to each individual composing the firm of Roby & Nichols, as well as the property of said firm, and that for that reason the court erred in construing it to be a valid assignment.
2. That one partner can not make a valid assignment by virtue of the Act of 1879 for the benefit of accepting creditors for a firm without the written authority of all the members not signing the deed of assignment.
Upon the authority of Coffin v.' Douglass, 61 Texas, 406, and cases there . cited, we think the deed of assignment, if executed in a manner to bind both partners, conveyed all the property belonging to either, as well as. the partnership property, not exempt from forced sale.
It may be conceded that the terms of the instrument in this regard are ambiguous and susceptible of two constructions; but such being the case, the rule is well settled that the construction which will sustain its validity and render it operative should be adopted. Burr, on Ass.. 480.
As to appellants’ other proposition, it is true that in so far as Nichols was acting for Roby in executing the assignment he was Roby’s agent; and it is also true that an agent can not convey his principal’s real estate unless he has written authority so to do (.Revised Statutes, article 548); but it does not follow from this that every assignment executed by an agent without written authority is void.
An assignment under the statute for the benefit of accepting creditors must convey all the property not exempt from forced sale, whether individual or partnership, belonging to the person or persons making such assignment; but when the assignor owns no real estate subject to forced sale, we see no reason why an assignment made by an agent acting under verbal authority only should not be held valid.
Delivered October 26, 1892.
In Kittrell v. Blum, 77 Texas, 336, it is stated in the opinion that such an assignment would be valid, though such statement was not necessary to a decision of that case.
Applying this rule to the assignment before us, our opinion is that the court below erred, in the absence of testimony showing that Roby owned no real estate subject to forced sale at the time the same was executed by Nichols, in holding it to be a valid assignment. It purports to convey real as well as personal property, and this we think is sufficient to place upon those claiming under it the burden of showing the facts which will render it certain that it did pass title to all the property owned by each member of the firm not exempt from forced sale, as well as that belonging to the partnership.
If upon another trial it is made to appear that Roby owned no real estate subject to forced sale at the time the assignment was executed by Nichols, then it should be sustained and held valid; otherwise it should be held void.
The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.

219156,"J. H. Brush v. The Clarendon Land, Investment, and Agency Company, Limited, et al.",1893-01-31,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
December 13, 1888, the appellee company, as plaintiff, brought suit against J. H. Brush, D. H. White,"" W. A. Allan, A. S. McKinney, and L. H. Carhart as defendants. July 12, 1889, it dismissed its suit against the four persons last named, retaining J. H. Brush, appellant herein, as the sole defendant. Thereupon, at the instance of Brush, the parties- against whom the dismissal was had were again made parties to the proceedings.
The plaintiff sued to recover of the defendant Brush the sum of $6525, besides interest, alleged to be due on a contract for the pasturage of certain cattle at the rate of $1.50 per head per annum. The items claimed to be due for pasturage were as follows: For 1900 head of cattle from August 1, 1886 (at which last named date the defendant sold and removed about 675 head), $2850; on August 1, 1887, for pasturage on 1225 head, $1837.50; and August 1, 1888, $1837.50.
The defendant Brush, among other pleas (including a plea of payment of the first year’s pasturage), filed a special plea or cross-bill against the plaintiff company and against the remaining persons made parties at his instance. His allegations were, briefly and substantially stated, that himself, White, Allan, and McKinney were the joint owners of 1400 head of steer cattle placed in the pasture of plaintiff, and that himself, L. II. Car-hart, and W. A. Allan were the joint owners of 500 head of stock cattle there delivered; that a contract with the plaintiff company for the pasturage of the cattle was made between the plaintiff company and the parties named with reference to their several interests, and that these parties should be held to contribute to the payment of the pasturage, if any was due. He alleged, that on the delivery of the cattle to the plaintiff company, the latter undertook to perform the duties of an agistor with reference to them, and to take care of them with all reasonable diligence and attention; that in violation of its duty plaintiff had overstocked its pasture, and because of its willful and cruel negligence large numbers of the cattle were starved to death; that plaintiff had accounted for only 822 head of the cattle delivered to it; that the remainder, aggregating in value $24,382, had been lost through the willful negligence of the plaintiff or converted to its own use. The defendant prayed for relief in accordance with these allegations.
The court tried the case without a jury, and rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff against the defendant Brush for $1433.80, and in favor of White, Allan, McKinney, and Carhart against the cross-action of Brush; hence the latter has appealed to this court.
The defendant requested no special findings of fact by the trial court. We find in the record, however, the court’s conclusions of law. Wherever, as in this case, there is on any issue a material conflict in the evidence, and no conclusions of fact are sought or found by the trial court, it becomes our duty to so interpret the testimony as to sustain the legal conclusions or the judgment appealed from. Applying this rule, we find the following conclusions of fact:
1. On May 5, 1885, J. H. Brush, B. H. White, A. S. McKinney, and W. A. Allan entered into the following agreement:
“It is agreed by and between J. H. Brush and B. H. White, A. S. McKinney, and W. A. Allan, that in case J. H. Brush buys from 1000 to 2000 one or two-year-old steers, to be kept on the Clarendon Land and Investment Agency Company’s ranch in Donley County, Texas, till they are three years old, and then driven to market with the beef steers by said company, and to be sold by L. II. Carhart as ágent for account of said parties, and after said steers are bought, the said Brush shall execute to said White, McKinney, and Allan a contract for a three-quarter interest in said steers to be so kept and sold as above, then the said White, McKinney, and Allan will execute a written agreement to said Brush to jointly assume all liabilities of and pay for a three-fourths interest in said steers, and pay said Brush 10 per cent interest on the money invested in their part of said steers, to be computed annually; Brush to pay all transportation and other charges up to the time of the sale of the cattle, and to receive at the time of and from proceeds of sale of the steers the pay for said White, McKinney, and Allan’s part of the cattle, and then they are to receive all proportionate gain over cost, charges, and interest on the transaction, or pay their proportionate of the loss, if any.
u Clarendon, May 5, 1885.
“ J. H. Brush,
„ “B. H. White,
“A. S. Mckinney,
“ W. A. Allan.”
2. Subsequently, during the summer of 1885, J. H. Brush, L. H. Car-hart, and W. A. Allan entered into a verbal contract with reference to 500 head of stock cattle, the contract being in other respects of tenor similar to that of the preceding written agreement.
3. J. II. Brush bought with his own funds and delivered for pasturage to the plaintiff about 1900 head of cattle in May and June, 1885. He agreed to pay to the plaintiff for pasturage services the sum of 81.50 per head per annum. He and the plaintiff alone were parties to the contract of pasturage. All the cattle were kept in plaintiff’s pasture until about the month of July, 1886, when the defendant Brush sold to different persons about 822 head. Before selling them he obtained the written consent of White, Allan, and McKinney with reference to the sale of such as were steer cattle, and of Allan and Carhart with reference to the sale of such as were stock cattle. This consent was given by the parties named, not because they claimed any interest in the cattle pastured or sold, but purely to accommodate Brush.
4. After the cattle were delivered to plaintiff for pasturage, Brush never made nor offered to make a bill of sale transferring a three-fourths interest in the cattle to the remaining parties named in the agreement above set out. The cattle, except the number sold and about 150 head which were in the pasture when this suit was instituted, died from stress of weather during the winter of 1885 and spring of. 1886. This loss was not due to the negligence of plaintiff, which bestowed upon the cattle such care and prudence as would a reasonable person upon his property under similar circumstances. The 150 head of cattle referred to were held by the company subject to the demand and disposition of their owner Brush. The defendant Brush has never made any payment upon the amount due for pasturage; and a sufficient amount to cover the sum adjudged by the court below is due for the pasturage of cattle before the sale and before the loss above referred to.
1. There was no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the parties to this suit other than the defendant Brush.
2. The defendant Brush is liable to the plaintiff, under his contract of pasturage, in the amount adjudged against him by the trial court.
3. The plaintiff,' as an agistor, did not insure the safety of the animals entrusted to its care. It was held to ordinary care in looking after these animals, and is responsible for ordinary negligence with reference to them; and having bestowed such care upon them, it is not liable to the defendant Brush for their loss. Story on Bail., sec. 443.
4. As we interpret the contract between the defendant Brush and the remaining parties named in our first conclusion of fact, no interest in the cattle was to vest in these parties until Brush should execute in their behalf a contract transferring to them the interest specified in the agreement. The making of a bill of sale or contract conveying such interest is construed by us as a condition, a compliance with which on the part of Brush was necessary to beget liability on the part of the remaining parties to the agreement. The language of the contract, while quite obscure, and the circumstances under which it was executed, justify the conclusion that such an interpretation as we here state was intended by the parties. The contract left it quite within the option of Brush whether, in the first instance, he should buy the cattle at all, or in the second, whether he should transfer them to the remaining parties. This option he exerted by the purchase in the one case and the failure to transfer in the second. Anson on Con., 142.
5. As the cattle remaining in the pasture of the plaintiff were subject to the control and disposition of the defendant Brush, and as .it does not appear that plaintiff has converted them, appellant is not entitled to a judgment for their value.
6. Of the 150 head of cattle referred to in our conclusion of fact number 4, 21 head have been sold by the appellee’s manager pending this suit, by agreement of appellant and appellee. The proceeds, amounting to $420, have been deposited by the manager without prejudice to the parties to the suit. The judgment herein rendered is not to operate as a bar to the prosecution by appellant of any claim which he may have on account of the 150 head above mentioned, their proceeds, or value.
These conclusions, we think, dispose of the questions presented in appellant’s several assignments of error.
The judgment is therefore in all things affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered January 31, 1893."
216184,"Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company v. John Roemer",1892-10-26,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
This suit was instituted by the appellee, John Roemer, against the appellant, the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company, in the County Court of Guadalupe County, on the 11th day of September, 1888, for the avowed purpose of recovering damages of the said defendant in the sum of $1000 — $500 actual and $500 exemplary damages. The plaintiff alleged that on the 17th day of February, 1887, he purchased of defendant’s agent at Seguin a ticket which entitled him to one passage from the depot in Seguin to the depot in Kingsbury, a distance of about ten miles.
That on the said 17th day of February, 1887, at about 9 o’clock p. m., he boarded the cars of defendant, and that soon after said train had pulled out from the depot at Seguin the conductor came to plaintiff and took up his said ticket. That defendant’s servants failed to check said train of cars when the station of Kingsbury was reached, but that said train ran by said station at a great rate of speed, and never checked until it ran about two and one-half miles beyond said station, when it came to a halt; and that the servants of said defendant in charge of said train willfully deceived plaintiff and caused him to leave said train at a point two and one-half miles from the station of Kingsbury, the place of his destination. lie further alleged that the night was dark, cold, and rainy, and that he was in the manner aforesaid induced to leave said train at a late hour of the night, and that in making his way home to Kingsbury he slipped and many times fell, and from said falls received injuries to his person and suffered great mental and physical pain, to his damage aforesaid.
The defendant answered, first, by setting up by special demurrer the statute of one year’s limitation — the plaintiff having alleged that his injuries complained of were received on the 17th day of February, 1887, and the suit having been commenced on the 11th day of September, 1888. It further plead specially limitation of one year; that “while the train ran by the station of Kingsbury, which was for the train on which plaintiff was being transported only a flag station, that said train was never checked at said station unless some one wished to get off or on said train. That the servants in charge of the train were aware that plaintiff wished to get off at Kingsbury, but that the bell cord became foul on approaching the said station and the conductor was thereby prevented from giving the usual signal for the engineer to stop said train, and in consequence of said unavoidable accident the train was pulled by said station for a distance of about four hundred yards, where plaintiff voluntarily got off from said train; that nothing on the part of the servants of defendant was done in malice or hatred.”
The jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and gave him $500 damages — $250 exemplary damages and $250 actual damages — and it is from this verdict and judgment this appeal is taken.
The first assignment of error complains of the action of the trial court in overruling the special demurrer addressed to the petition, on account of the action being barred by the statutes of limitation of one year, the suit being filed about eighteen months after the injuries complained of were received.
The contention of appellant is that the action is one of tort, and is barred in one year from the date of infliction of the injuries, and is regulated by subdivision 1 of article 3202, Revised Statutes.
Upon the other hand, the appellee contends that the cause of action is based upon a breach of the contract to safely deliver and put him down at the place agreed upon.
Which of these diverse views is correct, presents the question for our determination.
The basis of this action rests not upon the naked violation of the contract to safely put the passenger down at the station agreed upon, but for the personal injuries received by the passenger growing out of negligent failure of the appellant to perform its duty to the appellee, and for the willful conduct of the servants of appellant in inducing appellee to leave the train at the point other than his destination. The damages sought to be recovered flow from mental and physical injuries sustained by appellee, resulting from the gross negligence of the servants of appellant.
The foundation of every tort lies in the violation of some legal duty or some unlawful act or omission.
The essence of the wrong in this case consists in the violation of the duty that the carrier owed to the passenger, and the willful and negligent failure to perform the acts tending to an observance of this duty. This duty is a thing different from the mere contract obligation, and the right of action rests not alone upon the contract obligations of the parties, but upon the negligence in failure to observe this legal duty. ‘ ‘ The duty and the tort grow out of the entire range of facts, of which the breach of the contract was but one.”
New Orleans, Jackson & Great Northern Railway Company v. Hurst, 36 Mississippi, 665, was a case in which the carrier carried the passenger beyond the station agreed upon in the contract of carriage, and compelled Mm to leave the train at a place beyond such station. The jury in this case awarded the plaintiff $4500, and it was insisted upon the part of the railroad company that the action was one of contract, and no special damages being claimed in the declaration, and as exemplary damages were not recoverable, the verdict of the jury was excessive.
The court say: “Under our system of pleading, the formal distinctions between actions are abolished, and the declaration states the facts which constitute the cause of action plainly, distinctly, and substantially. In determining, therefore, the character of action, we look to the substance of the whole statement and not to the mere formal language in which it is expressed. * * * Hence, where facts are plainly and distinctly stated, the action will be regarded as either in tort or contract; having-regard, first, to the character of the remedy such facts indicate; and second, to the most complete and ample redress which, upon the facts stated, the law can afford; with due regard to the rights of the defendant. The character of the action must be determined by the nature of the grievance rather than the form of the declaration. And in cases of this character (against common carriers), the courts are inclined to consider it as founded in tort, unless a special contract very clearly appears to be made the gravamen and object of the complaint in the declaration. These doctrines are clearly and distinctly announced in the case of Heim v. McCaughn, 32 Mississippi, 39.
“ The case before us presents under these views the inquiry whether this declaration seeks to recover damages for the breach of the contract stated therein, or whether the wrong or injury complained of was that the defendant in error, after acquiring the right to travel on plaintiff’s cars, by contract, to a certain depot, while lawfully in the enjoyment of that right, was compelled to leave said cars at a distance from the place of his destination, by defendant ?
“ The contract is stated as inducement to the action; as the foundation of the defendant’s in error right to be in the cars; to show that he was lawfully there.
‘ ‘ The declaration next shows that without the consent and against the remonstrance of the defendant in error, he was forcibly carried beyond the point where it was the duty of plaintiff in error to have allowed him to stop, and the declaration shows that he was compelled to leave the train at that point. Here is not only a breach of contract and violation of a public duty by the carrier, but a willful and forcible wrong. The case is therefore much stronger for defendant in error than were the facts in the case of Heim v. McCaughn, 32 Mississippi, 1.
“A violation of a general duty to the public was in this case regarded as sufficient to determine the character of the action as one founded in tort and not in contract, and sufficient to authorize the jury in awarding exemplary damages. The decision in this case is conclusive of the question presented in this as to the form of action as well as the right of the jury in such cases to find the damages.”
Cregin v. Brooklyn Crosstown Railway Company, 75 New York, 192, was an action by the husband against a carrier to recover for loss of services of the wife, and for expenses paid in consequence of injuries to her person, resulting from defendant’s negligence while she was a passenger. Held by the court to be an action grounded in tort.
From the entire range of the facts as pleaded, it appears that the contract was simply alleged as matter of inducement showing the obligation resting upon appellant, and of appellee’s right to be upon its train of cars. And that the gravamen of the action rests upon the violation of the duty resting upon appellant, of which the breach of the contract is simply an incident. The facts show an action for personal injuries resulting from a violation of the duty owing to appellee by the appellant. If it was simply an action founded upon contract, upon what principle could exemplary damages be awarded, as are claimed in the petition ? In the absence of our statute giving a cause of action to the heirs of a decedent, could the heirs of appellee have maintained a suit in the event he had died from the injuries complained of in this case ? We think not. It is just such character of action, as is fully illustrated by the books, that does not survive at common law. If it was an action simply upon contract, it would survive and the heirs would have their remedy.
We think the court erred in not sustaining the demurrer.
It is claimed by appellee that there is an allegation showing damage done to the clothes worn upon the person of appellee at the time the injuries were received, and that such damage being to property, that item is not affected by the statute of limitations of one year. We do not regard the pleadings as having this effect. There is no express allegation showing any amount of damages to the clothes of appellee. And the entire claim for damages seems to be based upon the mental and personal injuries received by the appellee.

219167,Belle Hunt Shortridge et al. v. S. B. Allen et al.,1893-01-31,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
April 20,1890, G. N. Rice instituted this suit of trespass to try title, to recover from appellees herein as defendants a survey of 640 acres of land, lying in Cooke County, and patented to the heirs of Estevan Mora. The plaintiff Rice claimed the land by virtue of certain conveyances executed by persons claiming to be heirs of Estevan Mora. Pending the suit, the appellants herein, Belle Hunt Shortridge and others, who are heirs of W. H. Hunt, intervened. Their claim is founded upon the transfer to W. II. Hunt, their ancestor, of the certificate by virtue of which the land was located. This transfer was executed by Jose Mora, Mauricio Mora, and Eulogio Mora, representing themselves to be the sole heirs of Estevan Mora. Before the trial in the court below, the defendants S. B. Allen and others purchased the interest of the plaintiff Rice, and thereby became admittedly the owners of more than one-tliird of the land in controversy. The suit was thus limited to an issue for the remainder of the land between the intervenors, as heirs of W. II. Hunt, and the defendants, as heirs of C. C. Alexander. This issue resulted in a judgment for the defendants, from which the intervenors prosecute this appeal.
January 13, 1855, a certificate for the land in controversy was issued to the heirs of Estevan Mora, on which certificate the land was patented September 12, 1859. November 10, 1854, three of the children of Estevan Mora, deceased, representing themselves to be his only heirs at law, sold the certificate, by warranty deed, to W. H. Hunt, the ancestor of intervenors. The grantors in this deed were not the sole heirs of Estevan Mora. The interest of the remaining heirs, amounting to more than one-third of the land in controversy, is the property of the defendants.
April 27, 1854, W. H. Hunt and A. M. and C. C. Alexander entered into the following contract:
“Memorandum of a contract entered into this the 27tli day of April, 1854, between A. M. and C. C. Alexander and William H. Hunt, both parties residents of the State of Texas and County of Fannin. The said A. M. and C. C. Alexander being the owners of the certificates described in the schedule hereunto attached, and being desirous to have them located, employ the said W. H. Hunt to locate them upon the following terms, viz.:
“ The said Hunt is to select the lands, cause them to be surveyed, return the field notes to the General Land Office, pay all government dues, procure the patents and deliver them to said Alexander at Bonham, entirely at his own expense. In consideration of which services the said A. M. and C. C. Alexander are to convey to the said Hunt one-third of the land so located, making him the owner of an undivided third of said lands. All certificates which may be added to the attached schedule hereafter shall be located by said Hunt under the terms of this contract.
“In testimony of which we sign our names and set our scrolls.
[Signed] “A. M. Alexander,
“C. C. Alexander, “Wm. H. Hunt.”
To this contract is attached a schedule of land certificates referred to in the m emorandum. In this list is the following entry: ‘ ‘ Estovan Mora, 2 claims, 640, 320; ■ P. 960;” the last named in the list being “ Elizabeth Jones, 3902.” The caption to this schedule is as follows: “ List of W. H. Hunt & Co. land certificates, located and unlocated, of which W. H. Hunt has an undivided one-third.” This memorandum is in the handwriting of Wm. II. 1-Iunt. The list of certificates, or the schedule attached thereto, is in the handwriting of one Fraily, who was the clerk of C. C. Alexander, except the last name appearing in the list, “Elizabeth Jones, 3902.” This is in the handwriting of W. H. Hunt. This memorandum or agreement, together with the transfer to W. II. Hunt, was among the papers of C. C. Alexander at his death, and has been in the possession of his executor ever since the qualification of the latter, in 1866. The heirs of C. C. Alexander own whatever interest A. M. Alexander had in the land in controversy.
W. H. Hunt died in 1864, C. C. Alexander in 1865, and A. M. Alexander in 1866.
S. B. Allen, the executor of C. C. Alexander, has paid the taxes on these lands since 1866, though it does not seem to have been rendered in the name of the estate in Cooke County. The taxes were paid in Fannin County, where Allen lived-, and were remitted by the tax collector of Fannin to the collector of Cooke County, except for the year 1879, when the land was sold for taxes because of the failure of the collector to remit. From this tax sale the executor subsequently redeemed the property.
Four years prior to .the suit the appellees, through their tenant, took possession of the land, fencing about 400 acres. The appellees, though well acquainted with them, did not inform the children of W. I-I. Hunt of the documents in their possession referring to this land. The children of Hunt, knowing that their father had previous'to his death dealt largely in land, had exerted diligent inquiry with reference to his claims. They had no intimation of Hunt’s connection with the land in controversy until after the institution of this suit.
The three assignments of error first urged by appellants complain alike, though in different terms, of the court’s finding, that Hunt, the ancestor of intervenors, sold the Mora land certificate co Alexander. This conclusion was evidently founded upon the recital contained in the memorandum heretofore set out, and entered therein by Hunt himself, showing that A. M. and C. C. Alexander are the. ‘1 owners of the certificates described in the schedule hereunto attached. ’ ’ This recital must be deemed binding upon Hunt and upon his privies in blood, in estate, or in law, and to estop him and them from asserting the existence of a state of facts different from that which the recital imports. Kimbro v. Hamilton, 28 Texas, 568.
The fact that the Estevan Mora certificate was issued after the execution of this memorandum or agreement does not affect the correctness of this conclusion, since by its language the agreement affects with its terms and conditions “ all surveys which may be added to the attached schedule.”
. The court also correctly held that the description of the Mora claim as given in thé schedule was sufficient to indicate that this certificate was in-O eluded in the transfer implied by the contract. The description reasonably identified the certificate or claim as the property intended to be transferred.
Appellants next insist that the court erred in finding ‘1 that the evidence is not sufficient to show that Hunt complied with his part of the contract for locating and procuring a patent for the land in controversy.” The evidence in the record, notably the recital in the caption preceding the list of claims or certificates attached to the memorandum, that • ‘W. H. Hunt has an undivided one-third” interest in the certificates constituting the list, in connection with the fact that the Mora claim had been , patented, indicates that there is probable error in the conclusion complained of. Such error, if it exist, will not require a reversal of the judgment. This action, while in form a suit of trespass to try title, must be viewed as in reality an action for specific performance, in so far as recovery is sought for the one-third locative interest stipulated for in the written agreement between the Alexanders and Hunt. The defendants pleaded against the recovery thus sought the statute of ten years limitation, and the defense of stale demand. If Hunt performed the locative services claimed by appellants, his cause of action matured with the procuring of the patent obtained in compliance with his locative contract. This patent having issued September 29, 1859, his cause of action then accrued, and the defense of stale demand began its course. Having thus commenced to run during the lifetime of W. H. Hunt, it is unaffected by the coverture or other disabilities of the intervenors; nor is its application changed by the fact, that by analogy to the statute of limitation it was suspended during the period intervening between the 28th day of January, 1861, and the 3d day of December, 1869. Cattle Co. v. Ward, 1 Texas Civ. App., 307.
Appellants seek to avoid the effect of stale demand by the plea that the appellees fraudulently concealed from them their interest in the land in controversy. For the reason that the right to specific performance and the cause of action thereon accrued during the lifetime of W. II. Hunt, and that he, at least, was necessarily apprised of the condition of the property, and that as above indicated the defense of stale demand was incipiently operative against him, it must be deemed to have continued against his heirs, and consequently this plea of fraudulent concealment can not be invoked.
It is therefore unnecessary to consider the plea of ten years limitations set up by appellees, or other questions discussed in the briefs of the parties.
The judgment is affirmed.

216193,Patrick McHugh et al. v. Nicholas Gallagher,1892-10-19,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
This is a suit by appellants as the heirs at law of Joseph Limerick and his wife Elizabeth Limerick, against appellee, to recover certain property described in an instrument set out in plaintiff’s petition, under which they allege the appellee claims title. They declare against this instrument, and say that it conveys no title to Eugene Bremond, the immediate vendor of appellee.
Delivered October 19, 1892.
A demurrer was addressed to the petition, which was sustained by the court, and judgment thereupon rendered, from which this appeal is prosecuted.
The evident reason why the court sustained the demurrer was, that it regarded the instrument as a conveyance from Joseph Limerick and his wife to Bremond, and vested the property sued for in him.
The sole question that we consider is whether the court erred in sustaining the demurrer.
We do not think that the instrument is of that uncertain and indefinite character of trust that the courts will decline to give effect to. But we are in doubt as to the meaning and legal effect of the instrument as operative as a conveyance, or whether testamentary ""in character.
It partakes of the nature of a purchase of the remainder after the life-estate has terminated, and has some of the elements of a conveyance of bargain and sale, and also some of its features suggest that its purpose was testamentary.
In construing the instrument we are to look to the intention of its makers, and when it is possible such information should be gathered from the face of the instrument; but when the instrument is uncertain in meaning, and its language ambiguous or of doubtful construction, resort should be had to the surrounding facts and circumstances that tend to show the meaning and purpose of the makers in executing the instrument. Evidence for this purpose was admissible under the pleadings, and the meaning of the instrument being doubtful and uncertain, the court should have heard evidence of such facts and circumstances connected with its execution as would tend, not to contradict the terms of the instrument, but to explain its purpose and meaning, in order to arrive at the intent of the makers. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 27 Texas, 340; Rogers v. Kennard, 54 Texas, 33; Grimes v. Watkins, 59 Texas, 139; Hunt v. White, 24 Texas, 652.

219214,Receivers of International & Great Northern Railway Company v. W. C. Wright and H. Bland,1893-01-11,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
This is an agreed case, and is submitted under the following statement and agreement of facts and issues:
“ Nature and Result of Suit.—Suit by Wright and Bland against Bonner and Eddy, to recover of them, in their official capacity as receivers, damages alleged to have resulted from unreasonable delay in receiving at Pearsall, for shipment to Chicago, 298 head of beef cattle, and from rough, negligent, and improper handling and carriage of same en route.
“Trial before the court, resulting in a judgment for plaintiffs for §945.15.
“ Agreed Facts.—1. May 26, 1890, Wright, one of the plaintiffs, verbally applied to Train Master Hume, at San Antonio, for twelve or thirteen cars, to be in readiness at Pearsall Station on the morning or the evening of May 28, 1890, to take out, on the morning of May 29, 1890, 298 head of beef cattle, belonging to plaintiffs, and destined for Chicago, Illinois, for sale on that market; and Hume promised to try to get the cars, and to wire the agent at Pearsall by the morning or afternoon of May 27, whether he could have them or not.
“ 2. Wright saw the agent at Pearsall and asked him if he had heard from Mr. Hume about any cars for him, and he answered, ‘ Yes,’ and that the cars would be at Pearsall to take out plaintiffs’ cattle on the next evening, May 28. He told the agent he wanted to know, as he did not wish to bring in the cattle unless they could be loaded out without delay the next morning, May 29. The agent stated to him that the cars would be at the station ready for him on the afternoon of the 28th, and that he could bring his cattle in and they would be loaded and shipped out early in the morning, about 9 or 10 o’clock, May 29. The cars arrived at Pearsall Station on the evening of May 28 to take out plaintiffs’ cattle the following morning, May 29, by 9 or 10 o’clock, and these cars were pointed out to Wright by the agent as the cars intended for the carriage of plaintiffs’ cattle.
11 3. Plaintiffs’ cattle were brought to the station and put by them into the big stock pen of the railway company, May 28, about 6 o’clock p. m.
“ 4. The cattle, when put in the pen, had not been inspected and could not be shipped until inspected.
“5. Early the next.morning the inspection began; but, after the inspection of about three or four car loads—about one-fourth of the cattle— one Jennings, another shipper, with about 300 cattle already inspected and ready for shipment, arrived at the station and demanded cars for their transportation.
“6. The agent, over the protest and objection of Wright, shipped Jennings’ cattle in the cars at the station which had been pointed out to him as the cars intended for plaintiffs’ cattle, and plaintiffs’ cattle were delayed' and held in the small pens contiguous to the large pen, into which they had been turned after the arrival of Jennings’ cattle, and while the same were being loaded into the cars, until about 6 o’clock in the evening of May 29. These pens were crowded and muddy, and the cattle were without food or water during the eight or nine hours delay occasioned by the refusal of the agent to permit the plaintiffs to have the cars which' were given to Jennings.
11 7. After the arrival of Jennings’ cattle, the inspection of plaintiffs’' cattle was suspended until after Jennings’ cattle were loaded, which consumed about two and a half hours.
"" “ 8. Had the inspection of plaintiffs’ cattle been proceeded with, and not suspended upon the arrival of Jennings’ cattle, the inspection could' have been completed and plaintiffs’ cattle loaded into the cars by 9 or 10 o’clock; and when the Jennings cattle arrived enough of plaintiffs’' cattle had been inspected to begin loading, and the balance of the cattle could have been inspected as fast as they could have been loaded, and the inspection and loading could have been carried on simultaneously without interruption to either, and both have been completed between 9’ and 10 o’clock in the morning. It usually took from ten to fifteen minutes to inspect and load a carload of cattle. It was the custom at the stock pens at' Pearsall, and along the entire line of the International & Great Northern Railway, to use the pens of the railway company for inspecting the cattle, and the practice was, when enough cattle had been inspected, to commence loading, and then to carry on the inspection and loading simultaneously. Plaintiffs’ cattle were in only two brands.
“9. The cattle sustained injury while delayed at Pearsall, and also* while en route to point of destination.
“ No question is made as to the character or extent of the injuries sustained by the cattle, nor of the amount of the judgment, if under the agreed facts the defendants are liable.
“ The question presented for the determination of the courtis, whether, under the agreed facts, the defendants were justified in giving to the Jennings cattle preference of shipment in the cars originally intended for plaintiffs’ cattle, and relieved from the consequences of the delay.
“ The appellants claim that the action of the agent in giving preference to the Jennings shipment was justified, and constituted a complete defense to its action for all injuries resulting from delay. Appellees, on the other hand, contend that the action of the agent was not justified and constituted no defense.”
The railway company has appealed, and in support of its general proposition, that under the agreed facts it is not liable for the delay in shipping plaintiffs’ cattle, and in giving preference to the Jennings shipment, cites article 784 of the Criminal Code and articles 4628, 4630, 4651, and 4251 of the Revised Statutes.
The article of the Criminal Code cited makes it a misdemeanor for any agent of a railway to receive for shipment any cattle unless they have been duly inspected according to law.
Article 4628 of the Revised Statutes requires the purchaser of cattle for shipment out of the county or for slaughter to procure a bill of sale from the owner, particularly describing the cattle.
Article 4630 provides, that when an inspector shall have inspected any animal or animals, he shall, on the presentation of a bill of sale or power of attorney from the owner or owners, duly signed and acknowledged, and on payment of his fees, deliver to the purchasers a certificate of inspection, which certificate shall not be complete until it and the bill of sale shall have been recorded in office of the county clerk and certified to by him under his hand and seal. It is then provided, that the certificate shall be delivered to the purchaser, and that it shall protect him from the payment of inspection fees for the same animals in any other district.
Article 4651 provides, that the inspector shall not make out certificate of inspection (which he is to record in his record) until he has examined the bills of sale and is satisfied that the person claiming the cattle has correct bills of sale or chain of transfer from the recorded owner, or is the owner himself, etc.
We do not think the plaintiffs were required to have all the foregoing acts of the Legislature complied with before they could deliver their cattle to defendants’ agent for shipment, or that the agent would be an offender under the code by receiving the cattle before such full compliance. After the cattle were in fact inspected, he would be authorized to receive them.
It is agreed, that if the inspection had been proceeded with and not suspended upon the arrival of Jennings’ cattle, the inspection could have been completed and plaintiffs’ cattle loaded into the cars by 9 or 10 o’clock, the time, according to the contract, when they were to be loaded; and it was the custom to carry on the loading and inspection at the same-time, when enough cattle had been inspected to commence loading.
We can not see how the inspection of the cattle, by the terms of the agreed facts, caused any delay. There would have been no breach of the contract or delay, if the agent had not stopped the delivery of plaintiffs’ cattle to receive Jennings’. A part of plaintiffs’ cattle were ready to be loaded, and they could have been inspected as fast as they were loaded. The fact that Jennings presented cattle for shipment could not affect the right of plaintiffs under their contract. Defendants were bound by the contract with plaintiffs, whatever may have been their obligations to Jennings. If the agent used the cars intended for plaintiffs’ cattle, they would still be bound on the contract with plaintiffs. Cross and Eddy v. McFaden & Logan, 1 Texas Civ. App., 461.
Under the facts and issues as presented, we are of opinion that defendants were liable for the delay, and were not relieved therefrom by the necessity, if it existed, to ship the Jennings cattle.
Appellants say, however, that the judgment can not stand, because the agreed facts fail to show how much of the judgment was for damages for delay, how much for injuries en route, and how much, if any, from other causes.
This objection to the judgment is answered by the ninth clause of the agreement, to-wit:
“ 9. The cattle sustained injury while delayed at Pearsall, and also while en route to point of destination.
“No question is made as to the character or extent of the injuries sustained by the cattle, nor of the amount of the judgment, if under the agreed facts the defendants are liable.”
We have decided the only question we are authorized to consider under the agreed case, and are of opinion that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.
Affirmed.
Delivered January 11, 1893."
216194,"H. T. Simon, Gregory & Co. v. Henry Ash",1892-11-03,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
This appeal is from a judgment in a garnishment in favor of the appellee, Henry Ash, and against appellants, who were judgment creditors of one Theo. Ash. To the judgment of the court, and to its previous rulings upon motions made by appellants, numerous objections are urged.
The first error assigned is, that the court erred in granting garnishee leave and further time to answer writ of garnishment, after having sustained appellants’ exceptions to garnishee’s original answer, and in refusing to render judgment for appellants for their debt, against garnishee, upon motion of appellants made to the court when it sustained their exceptions to the answer, on May 1, 1891.
The garnishee was served with a copy of appellants’ garnishment on the 17th day of December, 1890, and on the 24th day of April, 1891, at •the next term of the court after the service of garnishment, appellee answered, that on the 17th day of December, 1890, he was not indebted to defendant Theo. Ash, nor was he then indebted to him; that on the 17th day of December, 1890, he was in possession of two certain lots of merchandise and some money, and that he held the same by virtue of a certain deed of trust executed by Theo. Ash on the 15th day of December, 1890; and by said deed of trust he, the said Henry Ash, was authorized to sell said goods in due course of trade until sufficient money was realized to pay off certain debts in said deed specified, and if such sum was not realized by the 1st day of May, 1891, he was to sell the remainder of the goods at public auction; that a sufficient sum had not been realized to pay the debts, and that he was unable to say what amount of money would be realized until after he had disposed of the balance of the goods; that they would be sold for cash to the highest bidder on the 2nd day of May proximo, and he prayed for time until after said sale in which to make further answer; and he further answered that he knew of no other person who was indebted to Theo. Ash, or who had in his possession effects belonging to him.
This answer is not as full and specific as such an answer should be, and the court was right in sustaining exceptions to it. But it is insisted, that it is so defective that the court should have treated it as a confession by the garnishee, and rendered judgment for the debt of appellants. To this we can not assent. The garnishee can not be said to have refused or neglected to make answer to either of the inquiries propounded to him in the writ. When the answer of a garnishee- is defective, and exceptions to it are sustained, it does not follow that the court must treat the pleading as no answer, and visit upon the garnishee the penalty of failing or refusing to answer the writ. We do not think such a proposition can be sustained upon reason or by authority. The case cited by counsel (Freeman v. Miller, 51 Texas, 443,) does not sustain the position. In that case the garnishee failed to answer one of the two questions embodied in article 192, Revised Statutes. We think the-court did not err in refusing to render judgment for appellants, nor do we think there was error in granting appellee leave to file his amended answer at a later day of the term, and after the sale at auction of the remainder of the goods.
The next objection to the ruling of the court is, that the court refused the motion of appellants, made and heard on the 18th day of May, 1891, to compel Theo. Ash, their judgment debtor, and for whom a subpoena duces tecum had been issued on the 27th of April, 1891, to produce and bring into court his books and invoices showing his mercantile transactions from July 1, 1890, to December 15, 1890.
Without here deciding whether in a proper case it would be the duty of the court to sustain such motion, it is sufficient answer to this objection to say, that this court is not in possession of data sufficient to enable us to determine whether or not there was error in refusing the motion.
The record discloses the fact that Theo. Ash had ceased to be a resident of Anderson County, and was a resident of the city of San Antonio, and that the books and papers desired were in that city. From the facts before us, we can not therefore hold that the court would have been justified in compelling Theo. Ash, under the pains and penalties of contempt, to produce his books and papers into court.
The appellants, on the 21st day of May, just three days after their motion had been overruled, announced ready for trial when this cause was called for trial, and the trial proceeded. Had they on that day made a motion supported by proper affidavit for a continuance or postponement of the trial to a later day of the term, for the purpose of producing the desired books and papers to be used as evidence, we would have another and a different question before us.
The objections urged by appellee to this motion, that Theo. Ash is not a party to this suit, and that the books and papers are his private property, and therefore he can not be compelled to bring them into court, nor can the appellants use them as evidence in support of their contest with the garnishee, we dó not think are good. It is true that Theo. Ash is not nominally a party to this suit, but he is the judgment debtor of appellants, who are in this suit endeavoring to subject to the payment of their judgment property which they aver has been fraudulently conveyed to appellee. This suit is then but auxiliary to their former suit with Theo. Ash, and he has an interest in the issues formed between the parties to this suit; and he has certainly an interest in the property conveyed to the appellee, since the conveyance is but a mortgage and not an assignment. We take it then that Theo. Ash, though not joined as a party defendant with the garnishee, is a party in interest. But even third persons who have in their possession books or papers in which one of the parties have an interest may be compelled to produce them; and by interest, as the word is here used, we understand that if the documents are material evidence, for the party demanding them, such party has an interest in them, and their production may be compelled by either bill of discovery or by subpoena duces tecum. 3 Greenl., sec. 305. To this rule there are of course exceptions, but this case, in our judgment, does not fall within any of these exceptions. That these books and papers would be admissible in evidence for the purpose of contradicting the re: citáis in the deed, is we think manifest. This deed, as we have before remarked, is not an assignment; it does not convey the property to the creditors, and the law applicable to purchasers for valuable consideration from a fraudulent vendor does not apply to this case. When property is purchased for a valuable consideration from an insolvent debtor, and the conveyance is attacked as fraudulent by a creditor, it devolves upon him attacking the conveyance to show, first, that the conveyance was made by the vendor with the fraudulent intent to hinder or delay his creditors in the collection of their debts; and second, that this intent was known to the purchaser. But when the conveyance is made in trust to a third party for the benefit of certain preferred creditors, it is then immaterial whether this intent was or was not known to either the trustee or to the beneficiaries; and if the deed was executed with the intent to “ delay, hinder, or defraud creditors,” it is void. Baldwin v. Peet, 22 Texas, 710.
Says Judge Roberts, in the case cited above: “ The assent of creditors to a general assignment will be presumed, so as to give it effect, although they may know nothing of it when it is made; but when the assignment is made with fraudulent intent the assent of the creditors will not be presumed, and such deed is inoperative and void as to creditors, although the fraudulent intent was unknown to the trustee.”
The case of Baldwin v. Peet was one in which Baldwin sought by injunction to restrain a creditor from making his judgment by sale under execution of goods, wares, and merchandise in Baldwin’s possession, and which he was holding under an assignment made for the benefit of his creditors by an insolvent debtor, and the deed of conveyance was attacked by the execution creditor as fraudulent; and upon the trial in the lower court the jury were instructed, that if the deed was made with the fraudulent intent to delay, hinder, or defraud the creditors of the vendor, it was void, and that it was ‘1 immaterial whether that intent was known or not to the trustee.” And upon appeal to the Supreme Court that court declared that such charge was not erroneous.
The language of the statute of frauds would seem to rebut the idea that the party attacking a deed made upon good consideration only, such as the one under discussion, must, in addition to proving a fraudulent intent on the part of the vendor, show that that intent was known to the trustee. Article 2465, Revised Statutes, after denouncing as null and void conveyances made with the intent to defraud, delay, or hinder creditors, purchasers, or other persons of or from what they are or may be lawfully entitled to, shall as to such creditors, purchasers, or other persons, their representatives or assigns, be. void, concludes with. this declaration: ‘ ‘ This article shall not affect the title of a purchaser for valuable consideration, unless it appear that he had notice of the fraudulent intent of his immediate grantor, or of the fraud rendering void the title of such grantor.”
The only issue between the appellants and the garnishee, as we understand the law to be, was, what was the intention of Theo. Ash in making the conveyance? If the intention to hinder and delay the creditors influenced him, in whole or in part, as an object of making the deed, the deed would be void. If, on the other hand, to hinder and delay his creditors was only contemplated as an incident, and his real purpose and object in making the conveyance was to pay debts due the parties named in the conveyance, the deed would be valid. Vide Baldwin v. Peet, and authorities therein cited. Upon this issue, and upon it alone, rested the right of the appellants to subject the property conveyed to the appellee to the payment of their judgment against Theo. Ash, although the case was tried, it seems, upon the assumption by both appellants and appellee, that the deed would be valid, notwithstanding it might have been made with intent to hinder and delay his creditors by Theo. Ash, unless it was shown that such intent on the part of Theo. Ash was known to Henry Ash, the trustee.
Holding the view we do, as expressed above, as to what was the issue between the parties, our conclusion is, that it was the right and the privilege of the appellants to inspect the books and invoices named in their motion, and to put them in evidence if they should contain anything which was relevant and material to the matter in issue, and that Theo. Ash, if he was guilty of disobeying the subpoena duces tecum, was in contempt of court, and upon a proper showing it would have been the duty of the court to compel him to produce the desired books and invoices.
The objections of the appellants to the judgment of the court, upon the ground that the deed was fraudulent per se, we hold to be not good. The deed contains nothing which of itself would make the conveyance absolutely void. The rule laid down in Baldwin v. Peet, that a conveyance is not fraudulent per se unless it contains a provision or clause by which some benefit or advantage is reserved to the debtor at the expense of the creditors, or unless the instrument by inherent defects is inoperative as a conveyance, has been recognized and observed in an unbroken chain of decisions by the Supreme Court of this State, and is still the law, except so far as modified by the Act of 1879, regulating assignments. And applying the testas prescribed in that rule to the deed under consideration, it can not be said to be fraudulent upon its face, and the court would not have been justified in declaring it void for any of its provisions.
The authority given the trustee to employ attorneys and to carry on the business for four and one-half months, and the diiection that after the debts are paid any remainder of goods or balance of money arising from their sale should be turned over to the maker of the deed, are all badges of fraud, but none of these provisions, or all of them combined, make the deed void. They are simply facts tending to establish the fraudulent intent of the maker of the deed. The case of Gallagher & Co. v. Goldfrank, Frank & Co., cited by counsel in support of his first proposition under fourth error assigned, is not in conflict with the case of Baldwin v. Feet and other decisions in accord with the decision in that case. In the case cited the trustee was authorized to sell in the usual course of trade for an indefinite time; in the case under consideration the trustee is only authorized to continue to sell in due course of trade until May 1, 1891.
Appellee’s counter-proposition to second proposition under fifth and sixth errors, to-wit, “A writ of garnishment served, upon a trustee in charge of goods for the benefit of preferred creditors will reach only such surplus as may remain in the trustee’s hands after executing his trust,” is entirely correct, we think, when the deed is valid; but the proposition is not sound when applied to a deed which is invalid because executed with the intent to defraud or to delay or hinder creditors. In the case of Carter v. Bush, 79 Texas, 29, there was no charge of fraud in the execution of the deed of trust under which the garnishee was holding and disposing of the property conveyed by the debtor. We hold with the appellants, that if the deed of trust in this case is void for fraud, and the trustee had notice that the same would be contested by nonpreferred creditors, and he afterwards, without an order of court, disposed of the goods, he acted in his own wrong, and is liable to the appellants for the value of the goods in his hands at the date of notice given after the service of the writ of garnishment. Vide Morris v. House, 32 Texas, 492.
Nor do we concur in the counter-proposition to first proposition under eighth assignment of error. We hold that if any of the debts recited in a deed of trust made for preferred creditors be false and fictitious in whole or in part, and it be so charged in the pleading of the attacking creditor, the deed is void for fraud. Vide Brasher v. Jameson, Gregg & Co., 75 Texas, 139, and Blair v. Finlay & Brunswig, 75 Texas, 210. And it matters not whether the other creditors, whose claims are just and true, know of the fact or not.
Where an erroneous statement as to the amount of a debt has been unin tentiortally made, or where through inadvertence a debt is recited in the deed as still subsisting which has been paid or against which there is a setoff, such misstatements may be satisfactorily explained, and if so explained they should not avoid the instrument.
Delivered November 3, 1892.
We deem it unnecessary, in view of the disposition we must make of the caso, to consider the other assignments of error, and their counter - propositions, presented in the briefs of counsel.
After a careful consideration of the whole case, we think that the judgment of the lower court should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial; and it is so ordered.
Reversed and remanded.
Justice Williams did not sit in this case."
219201,The International & Great Northern Railway Company v. Frederike Kuehn et al.,1893-01-11,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
This is the second appeal of this case; the former is reported in 70 Texas, 582, to which we refer for statement of the case as there presented. The case went to trial again upon the same amended petition upon which it was submitted before, and an amendment styled a trial amendment. On the last trial there was verdict and judgment thereon for plaintiffs Mrs. Kuehn, now Mrs. Nolte, for §1500, and the two minor children, Willie Kuehn and Herman Kuehn, for §2000 each, or §5500 in all. Defendant has appealed.
The first assigned error is, that the court erred in overruling defendant’s general demurrer to the petition, as amended by the trial amendment filed November 20, 1889, because it shows no cause of action.
The fifth assignment of error is to the effect, that the court erred in overruling defendant’s special demurrers to plaintiffs’ pleadings, because they do not show proper precaution to prevent injury to deceased. Both of these assignments will be considered together.
On the former appeal it was held, that the petition upon which the trial was had (the same now before us, the second amended petition, filed December 8,1885), was good. Before the last trial, on November 20,1889, plaintiffs filed what is styled a substitute for trial amendment, in which it is alleged that defendant and its servants saw deceased Kuehn attempting to cross the railway in ample time to have checked and stopped the train, prevented the accident, and saved the life of deceased, but that defendant moved on at a rapid rate, regardless of his safety, and failed and neglected to stop the train, although it could have done so. That Kuehn did not see the train until he was ascending the steep to cross the road, and at a time when he could not with safety turn to the right or left, and could not stop with safety. It was also alleged, that the place where the road crossed was level before the railway was built, ‘1 and that the company failed and neglected to leave the crossing in as good order as it was, or as it might have been.”
These allegations were made in addition to those of the amended petition.
In that petition it was shown that plaintiff was compelled to drive his wagon over the railway at the crossing in order to reach his home; “ that the crossing was within the corporate limits of the city of New Braunfels, and the ordinances of the city required trains at that point not to exceed in speed the rate of six miles an hour, and that defendant had placed a sign board to that effect at the corporate limits,’ ’ and the following: “ On the said 27th day of February, 1883, at the point of intersection of the Seguin and New Braunfels road and defendant’s railway there was a wagon-crossing, which was constructed in an unskillful and negligent manner, and the top of the roadbed at said point of intersection was greatly above the level of the wagon road, and the dirt approaches to the wagon-crossing were unusually and excessively steep and very difficult of ascent, and an unusual and unnecessary period of time was required for heavy vehicles to cross said track; and defendant had carelessly and negligently erected ditches, cattle guards, and fences on the side of the said crossing, so as to render the same very narrow, and dangerous for vehicles to back or turn to avoid a train of cars.”
Other allegations are made, showing the collision, the injury, and such facts as would complete the statement of the case.
Taking all the allegations upon the subject in the amended petition and the trial amendment, it can not be said that they show a case of contributory negligence on the part of deceased that would certainly prevent a recovery by plaintiffs, or that deceased failed to exercise such care as the occasion demanded. The amended petition on which the first trial was had was on former appeal held to be good. The additional fact set up in the trial amendment, that deceased saw the train while ascending the way to the crossing, when he could not turn to the right or left or stop with safety, does not conclusively show that the collision was caused by his negligence. His position and all his surroundings calling for care on his part must be considered. The steep and narrow approach, the danger of his wagon running backward if he stopped, the impossibility of turning with safety, the speed of the approaching train as he may have presumed it to be according to the averment made, are all facts to be considered in connection with the time he is alleged to have seen the train. The distance of the train from him at the time he saw it is not stated. It may be the jury, upon the facts, will conclude that he was guilty of contributory negligence in driving on after he discovered the train, but we are not prepared to say they could not do otherwise under the facts as stated. It is not always negligence to cross a railway track at a regular crossing in front of a moving train. All the facts and necessities of the occasion, the responsibility therefor, the knowledge or means of knowledge of the person charged with negligence, are to be considered in deciding the question. The petition presented a question for the jury if the facts stated are true, and not one that should be decided by the court on demurrer.
Before the trial plaintiffs filed a motion to exclude parts of the answer of defendant’s witness Jones, on the ground that the question suggested the answer, and assumed that the bridge was crossed, the bell rung, and the whistle blown. The answer of the witness was, that the train made a good deal of noise [crossing the bridge] and ringing the bell [and in the usual travel along the road]. The court struck out the portions of the answer in the above brackets. Defendant excepted, and assigns error, that the question did not suggest the answer or assume the facts as stated.
There was an issue as to whether the bell was rung or the whistle blown; no dispute about crossing the bridge. The court allowed the only-part of the answer that was subject to the objection, and which should have been stricken out, to stand and to be read to the jury.
Appellant insists that there was error in admitting, over defendant’s objections, that part of witness Bartlett’s answer to the seventh direct interrogatory, because the witness answered matter that was not responsive to the question asked. The witness was testifying by deposition. The objection was made on the trial, and not by motion before announcement. The objection, as stated in the assignment, was to the form and manner of taking the deposition, and could not be made except by motion filed before announcement for trial.
There was an issue as to whether Kuehn died of the injuries received in the collision with the train or of Bright’s disease, Mrs Nolte, formerly Mrs. Kuehn, was allowed to testify, over objection of defendant, that Kuehn complained of his wound from the time of the collision up to the time of his death. Error is assigned to the ruling, because his complaints are hearsay, and that he was making evidence for himself.
The rule is, that complaints of existing suffering and exclamations of present pain are admissible as res gestee. If the complaints were made .after Kuehn had brought this suit for damages, or after the litigation was in view, they would not be admissible. 1 Whart. Ev., sec. 268, and authorities cited; 1 Greenl. Ev., secs. 102, 100.
There was no error in admitting testimony that there were trees near defendant’s right of way, or other obstructions preventing or interfering with the view of the train from the road where Kuehn was, whether the facts were alleged or not.
There was error in refusing to exclude the answer of the witness Beu • stedt, that “they [the persons operating the train] could have stopped and not have hit the wagon had they driven slower.” The witness was not an expert; his answer was an invasion of the province of the jury.
It was not error to allow proof of how much cotton and corn Kuehn could raise in a year, and how much he could earn in dollars and cents. It was not error to allow a witness to state how long it would take a team to cross the railway dump on the crossing from the beginning of the approach. 1 Greenl. Ev., 61.
It was error to admit testimony that the approach was too narrow to .allow a wagon to turn around on it with safety. The facts only could be stated to the jury. It was in proof that the ascent was steep, that the way was narrow; its dimensions were given; and it was shown that there was a precipice on each side, or at least steep sides, and that to back down the steep there was danger of running over the sides.
The question comes within the rule of the case of Shelley v. City of Austin, 74 Texas, 608. The jury should have been left to form their own conclusion from the facts. Cooper v. The State, 23 Texas, 336; Haynie v. Baylor, 18 Texas, 509.
It is insisted that it was error to allow proof that defendant had a signboard about seventy-five yards northeast of the crossing, with a direction upon it, ‘1 Trains will not here exceed six miles an hour.’ ’
The petition alleged that there was such a signboard at the corporate limits; the proof showed that it was within the corporate limits, over a mile. It was not necessary to plead the fact at all; but having been pleaded, it is contended that it must be proved as alleged, and that there is a fatal variance in the averments and the proof. The gist of the allegation was, that by the regulations of the company trains were not allowed to run faster than six miles an hour at the place where Kuehn was hurt. The proof was responsive to this issue. It would be a very technical application of the rule to hold that there was an essential variance, and we do not think it should be so held. This difficulty can be easily obviated before another trial 1 Greenl. Ev., secs. 56, 64.
In regard to the evidence of Hamilton, a life insurance agent, who testified that he was familiar with the Carlyle mortuary tables, and had worked under it, we may say, that while it is our opinion that an expert may give such testimony, it would have been more satisfactory if the-tables themselves had been offered.
This same witness was permitted by the court, over objection of defendant, to state the cost of raising a child in Guadalupe County, and that it would cost $10 per month. Defendant reserved exceptions to the ruling upon several grounds, among which was that the testimony did not give a proper basis for damage; and error is now assigned upon the same ground. The two minor children of deceased recovered each $2000 by the verdict and judgment. The testimony was clearly inadmissible. The measure of damages for these children was not what it would cost to board or educate them, but the pecuniary benefit they could reasonably expect to receive from their father during the probable duration of his-life. To ascertain what they might reasonably expect to receive from him, proof of his age, circumstances, health, habits of industry, sobriety, economy, occupation, skill and capacity, and such like facts, would be admissible. He was under oblications to raise his children, and to see that they were supplied with necessaries during their minority, but the cost of doing so would not be the measure of their legal loss by his death in a suit therefor. It might be much less or much more. Railway v. Cowser, 57 Texas, 300; City of Galveston v. Barbour, 62 Texas, 174; March v. Walker, 48 Texas, 375; Cotton Press Co. v. Bradley, 52 Texas, 601; Winnt v. Railway, 74 Texas, 32; Railway v. Douglass, 69 Texas, 694; Railway v. Lester, 75 Texas, 60; 75 Texas, 224; 78 Texas, 541.
We are not inclined to say that there was no evidence of gross negligence of defendant and its servants, and that the court should have so instructed the jury, as requested by the defendant.
In discussing the question of the degree of care to be used by a deaf person who was struck while walking on a railway track, Chief Justice Stay ton says: “The fact that such was his condition made it the more necessary that he should not place himself in a place of danger.” Artusy v. Railway, 73 Texas, 191.
This is correct reasoning, but we do not think it would be proper to single out the fact and so instruct the jury, especially where the court, as in this case, has fully and carefully instructed the jury as to contributory negligence.
On the former appeal of this case, Justice Walker, in speaking of the court’s charge, said: “ Having given a clear exposition of the law applicable to the facts, it was the court’s duty to refuse charges asked upon the subject covered by the general charge upon the effect of isolated facts as negligence or not.” 70 Texas, 581. The jury should be left to decide for themselves the meaning and force of the facts, unless made negligence per se by statute.
So we conclude there was no error in refusing the requested charge of defendant, that extra care was required of deceased in case his sight and hearing were defective.
Defendant also asked the court to instruct the jury, that “ when Kuehn was about to drive his wagon and team across the railway track, it was his duty to look and listen for an approaching train before attempting to cross the track, and not to drive carelessly into a place of possible danger; and if he failed to do so, and such failure contributed proximately to the injury, then plaintiffs cannot recover.” This instruction again singles out a particular fact and argues it for the jury, and for that reason is objectionable.
The court, in the general charge, told the jury, that “it was the duty of deceased to look out for the approach of the train, and to observe all reasonable precaution before attempting to cross the track.” And again, “A person about to cross the track of a railway upon a public highway is bound to exercise all reasonable care and caution to avoid injury in crossing.” Again, the court charged: “You are instructed as a matter of law, that it is not the exercise of ordinary care and prudence for a person to drive with a team directly onto a railway crossing without making an effort to ascertain whether a train is approaching, or whether it is safe to drive on the track with his team.”
This last charge was too much in favor of defendant; it told the jury, in effect, that certain acts would amount to negligence on the part of deceased.
There were other more general instructions upon the same subject. There was no error in refusing the special charge requested.
In the general charge the court instructed the jury, that the deceased and the railway company had an equal right to cross the road at the point where the accident happened, and that the law imposes on both parties the duty of using reasonable and prudent precautions to avoid accident and danger; and while it was incumbent on the railway company in running its train on the occasion referred to, to give the required signals by ringing the bell and sounding the whistle at least eighty rods before reaching the crossing, it was the duty of deceased to look out for the approach 'of the train, and to observe all reasonable precaution before attempting to cross the track.
This charge is objected to by appellant, because it declares that “ both ICuehn and the defendant had equal rights to the crossing.” This charge -does not so declare; but it might have been so understood. The company has precedence in the use of its road and crossing, but that precedence is regulated by law. The respective rights of the company and the public are well. understood, and are explained in so far as they are applicable to this case in other portions of the court’s charge. The company’s rights are recognized, and the jury by the charge are required to •observe them. So qualified, and qualified by the company’s precedent right to the use, there was no error in the charge. The supposed vice in the charge is, that it may have been construed to mean that deceased and defendant each had an equal right to cross at the same time.
In another special requested charge, the court is asked to tell the jury, that if ICuehn knew the crossing was bad, he should have been much more careful before attempting to cross. It was not necessary to so instruct the jury. A general charge upon the care to be used by deceased was sufficient and correct.
It was not error to instruct the jury to the effect, that if the signboard mentioned was near the crossing, ICuehn could presume that trains would not run faster than six miles an hour. But it would have been error to •charge, as requested by defendant, that all testimony as to the signboard .should be discarded from the consideration of the jury.
We do not think it incumbent upon us to decide as to the effect of the testimony offered to establish contributory negligence of ICuehn.
The witness Busch lived nearly one mile east of the crossing, near the railway track. He testified, that he had often timed the speed of the trains in coming from the bridge to his house, and it took one minute and forty seconds. The crossing where ICuehn was hurt was between the bridge and witness’ house.
The evidence was admissible to show the customary rate of speed of trains along by the crossing, travelling in the same direction of the train in question. It was shown that Kuehn lived near the crossing and often passed over it. The customary rate of speed of the train at this place was pertinent, as it gave him the right to regulate his conduct by it. For the same reason, it was not error to allow proof that it was the habit of persons operating the trains not to ring the bell in passing this crossing.
The evidence was admissible for the additional reason that it tended to prove that the bell was not rung on the occasion of the accident. There was a conflict in the testimony as to whether the bell was rung at the time or not; the testimony offered strengthened the probability that it was not rung. The fact was not a distinct collateral fact.
In the case of Grand Trunk Railway v. Richardson, 91 United States, 454, the question was whether the company’s locomotive caused a fire. Testimony was admitted, over objections, “ that at various times during the summer before the fire occurred, defendant’s locomotives scattered fire when going past the mill and bridge, without showing that either of those which the plaintiffs claimed communicated the fire were among the number, and without showing that the locomotives were similar in their make, state of repair, or management to those claimed to have caused the fire complained of.” Justice Shaw, delivering the opinion, said: “ The question has often been considered by the courts in this country and in England, and such has, we think, been generally held admissible, as tending to prove the possibility and the consequent probability that some locomotive caused the fire, and as tending to show a negligent habit of the officers and agents of the railway company.” 1 Whart. Ev., secs. 41, 42, 43, 40.
If special acts are admissible to show a habit of negligence, as decided in the foregoing case, the habit itself would undoubtedly be. There was no error in admitting the testimony.
Other errors assigned need not be noticed, as the questions will not probably arise on another trial.
Because of the errors committed on the trial, as before noted, the judgment of the lower court should be reversed and the cause remanded; and it is so ordered.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered January 11, 1893."
216287,"L. G. Huddleston, Administrator, v. H. Kempner",1892-11-03,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
This is an action by the appellee against the appellant as administrator of the estate of F. M. Huddleston, deceased, in the District Court of Anderson County, upon a rejected claim.
Defendant pleaded usury. Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, establishing the claim as presented to the. administrator. The facts are:
1. Plaintiff, H. Kemper, on March 3, 1890, was a cotton, factor and commission merchant in the city of Galveston, where he had an office and sample rooms, and employed clerks and carried on his business, to which he gave his personal attention.
2. On March 3, 1890, the plaintiff loaned the defendant’s intestate $3896.63, which was evidenced by several promissory notes payable to plaintiff, with 10 per cent interest until maturity, and after maturity 12 per cent interest per annum, together with 10 per cent as collection fees on the amount of principal and interest thereof, if sued upon or placed in the hands of an attorney for collection.
3. At the same time, and as a part of the same transaction, F. M. Huddleston contracted in writing with the plaintiff that he would ship and consign to him during the cotton season of 1890-91, extending to February 15, 1891, for sale by him on commission, subject to the customary charges in Galveston, Texas, and commissions to himself for the sale and handling thereof of 2-1 per cent of the amounts of the accounts of sale thereof, one bale of cotton for every $10 loaned, and in default of shipment of said cotton that he would pay plaintiff on February 15, 1891, $1.25 for each bale he so failed to ship, as liquidated damages. A mortgage upon real estate was executed by Huddleston to plaintiff to secure the money loaned, as well as the stipulated damages under the cotton contract, and all other indebtedness which might accrue; and as further security assigned to plaintiff certain collateral promissory notes. Such contracts were customary between cotton factors and their customers.
4. It was shown by the evidence that plaintiff used his capital in connection with his business in making advances to cotton shippers and to pay drafts drawn on cotton, in order to induce shipments of cotton, and not as a money lender; that he gave his personal attention to his business of cotton factor, and had an office, sample rooms, several clerks, and had provided every facility for carrying on his business.
5. F. M. Huddleston, on March 3, 1890, and up to his death, which occurred October 10, 1890, was engaged in a general merchandise business at Alder Branch in Anderson County. It was customary to make advancements and loans to merchants in the interior to assist them in buying bacon, lard, flour, and other goods to advance to the farmers to help them make their crops, especially cotton, consignments of which the plaintiff sought to induce.
6. After the death of Huddleston the notes were sent to plaintiff’s attorney for collection out of his estate. A claim was prepared and presented for the amount of the notes, interest, and attorney fees. No claim was made for the stipulated damages for failure to ship cotton, and no recovery was had therefor.
1. Whether or not the contract was usurious was a question for the determination of the court trying the case without a jury, under all the evidence. Such contracts have been usually upheld by the courts, when fairly made with the purpose of inducing consignments to the factor. Huddles-ton was a country merchant, and by his contract agreed to consign cotton to the plaintiff for sale on commission. The case of Cockle v. Flack, 93 United States, 343, is very similar to this case; and the cases of Norwood v. Faulkner, 53 American Reports, 717; Dozier v. Mitchell, 65 Alabama, 511; and Callaway v. Butler, 7 Southeastern Reporter, 224, are in point, to the effect that such contracts are not usurious when made in good faith for the purpose of inducing shipments of products to factors and commission merchants. There are no conclusions of fact in the record found by the court, but its judgment upon the statement of facts necessarily involves the conclusion that the transaction was not a cover for usurious interest.
It has been held by our Supreme Court, that a commission merchant may charge a commission for advances and legal interest thereon; and that such a transaction was not a mere loan for the sake of interest. Mills v. Johnson, 23 Texas, 309, 324. Appellant claims that it was a mere loan made by Kempner to Huddleston.
We think that the evidence shows very conclusively that it was a loan or advancement made in connection with the business of plaintiff, for the purpose of promoting the consignment of cotton to him as a cotton factor and commission merchant.
2. The attorney fees stipulated for in the notes were properly allowed by the court, although the maker of the notes had died, because they were placed in the hands of an attorney for collection. Simmons v. Terrell, 75 Texas, 275; Morrill v. Hoyt, 83 Texas 59.
3. It was also proper to allow interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum after maturity, for such were the terms of the contract, and the delay caused by the death of Huddleston would not have the effect to change the tenor of the note.
4. Appellant’s second amended assignment of error is, “ that the court erred in finding against appellant’s exceptions in his supplemental answer to appellee’s first supplemental petition.”
Delivered November 3, 1892.
The record shows no ruling of the court below on these exceptions, and they will be held to have been waived.
There is no error in the judgment of the court below, and it will be affirmed.

Justice Williams did not sit in this case."
216260,"Wilson Lumpkin v. L. E. Williams, Administrator",1892-11-03,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
The appellant, on August 18,1890, instituted in the District Court of Anderson County a suit against appellee, administrator of the estate of T. J. Williams, deceased, and one J. M. Silliman, for the purpose of setting aside a judgment rendered by default against appellant in said court, in favor of said Williams and said Silliman, on the 23rd day of April, 1889. The judgment was for the amount of a note with interest, executed by appellant to T. J. Williams on January 11, 1886, for $900, and foreclosure of mortgage upon several tracts of land, given by appellant to secure the payment of said note. This judgment and decree settled the respective rights of the estate of Williams and of Silliman in said note and mortgage; and from that judgment L. E. Williams appealed to the Supreme Court by writ of error, and that court affirmed the judgment. Appellant’s petition contained in substance the following averments: That T. J. Williams, to whom appellant executed the note and mortgage which constituted the basis of the judgment sought to be set aside, was an attorney at law, and for many years before the note was executed, and up to the time of his death, he was appellant’s attorney and confidential adviser, and that the note was given in payment of attorney fees due from him to Williams; and that a few days after the execution of the note Williams asked appellant to execute to him a mortgage, to secure the note, on appellant’s lands, not including his homestead, and to this proposition appellant assented, and Williams wrote the mortgage on three tracts of land, one of which was a tract of 640 acres off the Sarah Hodges survey. Relying on the assurances of Williams that the mortgage did not affect or include his homestead, appellant signed and acknowledged the mortgage. That upon this tract of 640 acres was situated the homestead of appellant, which had been continuously occur piéd by himself and wife, and after the death of his wife, in 1866, by appellant and his children, for about twenty-five years previous to the execution of the mortgage, and was still occupied by himself and family; that it was the distinct understanding with Williams that his homestead was not to be included in the mortgage, but by mistake of Williams it was included; that upon calling Williams’ attention to the mistake he promptly corrected the error by executing to appellant a release to 200 acres, to be taken out of the said 640 acres, upon which the appellant’s homestead is situated, and that said Williams assured appellant that his homestead could never be subjected to the lien of said mortgage under any circumstances; that the release so executed was by Williams duly acknowledged on the day of its execution, and on same day recorded in same volume in which the mortgage was recorded. That appellant never saw the release after it was filed for record, until the institution of this suit; that he thought at the time the release was written on the back of the mortgage, and so believed until he was informed by the officer before whom the release was acknowledged, a short time before the institution of this Suit, that it was written on a separate paper from the one on which the mortgage was written; that appellant did not take the release from the clerk’s office, because,he believed that it was a part of the mortgage, and that Williams was entitled to its custody, and supposed it was in his possession.
That at the time he was cited to answer the suit of the administrator, T. J.' Williams, he still believed the release was on the same paper on which the mortgage was written, and that relying on the assurances of Williams, the mortgagee, that his homestead could never be subjected to-the payment of the note, and having no defense to make against the note, he did not believe it necessary for him to make an appearance in the case or take any steps to protect his homestead from the mortgage. That the citation did not describe the lands on which the foreclosure was sought other than as three tracts of land; that he knew that there were three tracts covered by his mortgage, but he never supposed that the 200 acres out of the 640 acres of the Sarah Hodges survey, released from the mortgage, was a part of the lands which the administrator of Williams was seeking by his suit to subject to the payment of the note which was due from appellant to the estate of plaintiff’s intestate; and that appellant never knew or had reason to suspect that the decree foreclosing said mortgage rendered in said suit made said 200 acres, or any part thereof, liable for his debt to said plaintiff until about three months before he instituted this suit. That he confided in the assurance given him by Williams at the time he executed the release, and on what he then believed to be the fact, that the release was written on the same paper on which the mortgage was written; that Williams was at the time he executed the release the attorney and legal adviser of appellant, and had been for several years before, and so remained to his death. That had he known that the plaintiff was seeking to foreclose the mortgage upon his ""homestead, or had he reason to suspect that such was his object, he would have defended the suit.
He charges that both the plaintiff, Williams, and the defendant, Silliman, had both actual knowledge and constructive notice before the institution of said suit that his homestead was exempt from the mortgage, and that they both knew at the time the judgment was rendered against him that he did not resist the suit because he was ignorant of their purpose to subject his homestead to the payment of said note.
Appellant further averred, that when he discovered that his homestead was included in the decree of foreclosure he endeavored to induce the said Silliman and the plaintiff to release his homestead from the operation of said decree, and that said Silliman readily acceded to appellant’s request, and that the said plaintiff, who is the brother and the administrator of the estate of the said T. J. Williams, deceased, expressed his willingness to release the homestead, but said that he must first consult his counsel, and after consulting his counsel he refused to make the release. And appellant concluded with prayer, that said administrator and said Silliman might be made defendants to this suit; that the judgment rendered against him on the 23rd day of April, 1889, by default be set aside, and that he be permitted to make his defense to the suit, or that the said judgment be amended so as to release his homestead. And pending this suit appellant, by amended petition, averred that an order of sale had been issued upon said judgment, and he prayed for an injunction, enjoining the sale of his homestead; and the writ was granted and the sale of the homestead enjoined.
Defendant Silliman made no appearance in the suit, but defendant Williams appeared and by his counsel filed motion to dissolve the in junetion and dismiss the suit, which motion was sustained and the injunction dissolved and appellant’s suit dismissed.
The grounds upon which the defendant rests his motion are five:
1. The want of equity in the petition.
2. The suit was filed more than twelve months from the date of the judgment sought to be set aside.
3. That the grounds for injunction existed before the judgment.
4. Petitioner had a legal remedy by appeal or writ of error.
5. That petitioner shows that he was guilty of gross negligence in not making his defense, if he had one, to the suit at the time of the trial.
The rule under which a court of chancery permits a judgment to be opened, after the expiration of the term of court at which the judgment was rendered, for the purpose of making defense to the suit, requires that the party seeking such relief must have a legal and equitable defense, and he must not have been guilty of culpable neglect in not making his defense; and he must further show that he has no remedy for the wrong and injury inflicted by the judgment. This rule has been long established and enforced -by courts of equity. Our statute, article 2875, Revised Statutes, declares, that' no injunction to stay execution upon any valid and subsisting judgment shall be granted after the expiration of one year from the rendition of the judgment, unless it be made to appear that an application for an injunction has been delayed in consequence of the fraud or false promises of the plaintiff in the judgment, practiced or made at the time of or after the rendition of such judgment; or unless for some equitable matter or defense arising after the rendition of such judgment.
The question for our decision is, are the averments in appellant’s petition sufficient under the rules of law, as recited above, to entitle him to the relief sought by his suit; and upon the answer to this question depends the correctness or incorrectness of the judgment appealed from. In considering a motion to dissolve and dismiss, the allegations of the petition must be taken and held to be true.
That the appellant had a meritorious defense to the original suit, so far as the plaintiff in that suit sought to subject appellant’s homestead to the payment of the moneyed judgment recovered by plaintiff, we think there can be no question. The mortgagee had released the homestead from the operation of the mortgage before he- assigned it,- and the release was duly recorded on the day of its execution.
Was appellant’s application for injunction within the time prescribed by article 2875, Revised Statutes? The petition charges that both the plaintiff and defendant, Silliman, at and before the rendition of the judgment foreclosing the mortgage lien upon appellant’s homestead, had actual knowledge, and constructive notice as well, that the homestead had been and was released from the operation of the mortgage executed by appellant to the plaintiff’s intestate, and that they, the said plaintiff and the said Silliman, knew well that defendant was ignorant of any purpose on their part to take a foreclosure upon his homestead, and that they knew that he would interpose a defense if he had known of their purpose to subject to the payment of the debt due the plaintiff’s intestate the homestead of appellant. These averments, in our judgment, meet the requirements of the statute, and demonstrate that the appellant’s application for an injunction was delayed in consequence of the fraud practiced by plaintiff on defendant at the rendition of the judgment. By these averments the judgment of foreclosure was manifestly obtained by the fraud of the parties in concealing from the court the fact that a portion of the lands covered by the mortgage, which was occupied and claimed by defendant as his homestead, had been released by the mortgagee. We therefore hold that the second ground set out in the motion to dissolve the injunction and dismiss this suit is not good, and could not be a basis of the judgment sought by the motion.
This brings us to the consideration of the only other ground for the motion, which we deem it necessary to notice, to-wit, that appellant’s defense to plaintiff’s suit being known to appellant at the time of citation upon him, he was guilty of such gross neglect in not prosecuting his defense within the time prescribed by law as should deny him the remedy sought by his petition. This point is the only one of any difficulty presented by the record.
The rule, that he who seeks relief from equity from the effects of a judgment rendered against him after personal service, must show that he was not guilty of culpable neglect in not making defense to the suit before judgment, is simple and easily understood, but its application is often attended with difficulty. In our examination of authorities cited by counsel for appellee, we find no case entirely analogous to the one under consideration.
The case of Wicke v. Lake, 27 Wisconsin, 410, is more analogous in its salient points to this case than any we have found. In this Wisconsin case the appellee, Lake, was made a party defendant to a suit for the foreclosure of a mortgage. Lake was owner by title paramount to that of the mortgagee of a portion of the land mortgaged. When cited tó answer the plaintiff’s suit, he consulted with his codefendants, and was informed by them that they had a complete defense to the suit in the opinion of their counsel; and he then consulted counsel of ability and experience, who, after examining the defense made to the suit by his codefendants, assured Lake that the defense was a complete one to the recovery by the plaintiff. Belying upon this advice, Lake failed to answer the suit, and judgment was taken against him by default, and the plaintiff recovered against the other defendants, obtained a decree foreclosing the mortgage upon all of the lands covered by the mortgage, including that portion to which Lake had title; and his excuse for not defending the suit was held sufficient, upon his application to have the judgment set aside as to him and to allow him to answer. In the lower court the excuse set up by Lake was held insufficient, but upon appeal to the Supreme Court the judgment of the lower court was reversed and the cause remanded, with order that the judgment by default be set aside and that appellant be allowed to make his defense.
Delivered November 3, 1892.
In this case it is shown by averments in the appellant’s petition, that Williams, to whom he executed the mortgage, was an attorney and counselor at law, and was at the time of the execution of the mortgage, and so continued until his death, appellant’s attorney and confidential adviser, and that Williams assured him when he executed the release that his homestead could never be held liable for the mortgage debt, and that he need give himself no uneasiness about the exemption of his homestead from the operation of the mortgage. The appellant further avers in- his petition that he believed at the time of the execution of the release that it was written on the same paper as that containing the mortgage, and that he still believed this until after the judgment and a short time before the institution of this suit, when the release was found in the clerk’s office in which it was recorded; and that believing this, coupled with the assurance of the mortgagee that his homestead could never be subjected to the operation of the mortgage, he thought it unnecessary to make any defense against the suit for foreclosure of the mortgage. And another fact which seems to have lulled him into security is, that the citation did not describe the land further than as three tracts, and the mortgage he knew to be upon three tracts, one of which was the 640 acres upon which was his homestead.
In view of all the facts, we are unable to say that the petition did not show-sufficient excuse for appellant’s failure to defend the suit and show that his homestead was released from the operation of the mortgage; and we therefore think that the court erred in sustaining the appellee’s motion to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the suit.
The judgment of the lower court will be reversed and the cause remanded for another trial.
Reversed and remanded.
Justice Williams did not sit in this case."
219137,McCurdy & Daniels v. J. P. Locker,1893-01-18,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
This is a suit of trespass to try title, brought by appellants McCurdy & Daniels, against appellee J. P. Locker, for the Wm. McFarland 320 acres survey in Bosque County, patented February 9, 1847.
Defendant pleaded not guilty, disclaimed all interest in the McFarland survey and possession thereof; “ that he is not now and was not at the institution of the suit in possession of said land and premises described in plaintiffs’ petition.” But he sets up that he was in possession of the south half of the E. D. Johnson 320 acres survey, which 160 acres are described in the answer as beginning at the southwest corner of said Johnson; thence north 30 west 760 varas to the northwest corner, marked by a pile of rock; thence north 60 east 950 varas to the northeast corner of this; thence south 30 east 760 varas to the southeast corner of this; thence south 60 west 950 varas to the beginning.
Defendant also set up, in bar, statute of limitation of five years to the same 160 acres.
The McFarland and the Johnson surveys were made by the same surveyor, the former on the 28th and the latter on the 29th day of September, 1846. The original field notes of the McFarland call for two willow trees as witnesses of its northwest corner, and thence north 60 east 950 varas to its northeast corner, where two live oak trees are called for as witness trees. The Johnson calls to begin at the northwest corner of the McFarland; thence to run north 60 east 950 varas to the southeast corner of the Johnson, at both corners calling for the very witness trees named in the McFarland; that is to say, the north line of the McFarland is the south line of the Johnson.
The locality of this line was in dispute, plaintiffs claiming it at one place and defendant claiming it to be further south. This question was submitted to the jury, together with defendant’s plea of limitation. The verdict located the line where plaintiffs claimed it to be, “ 20 varas north 30 west from the branch as claimed by plaintiffs;” but the jury also found in favor of defendant’s plea of limitation, and awarded him the land actually occupied by him, about 34 acres, a strip off of the north end of the McFarland, 200 varas wide, for which judgment was rendered in his favor, and plaintiffs appealed.
There are several assignments of error to rulings of the court on the answer of defendant, to the admission of testimony, to the charge submitting the plea of limitation, and other matters; but they nearly all relate to one subject, more or less directly, that as defendant disclaimed ownership or possession of any part of the McFarland survey, and as his plea of limitation and deeds restricted his claim to the E. D. Johnson survey, he could not recover under the plea any part of the McFarland,, where the jury found the disputed land to be.
This is doubtless correct. The statement of facts shows that plaintiffs, owned the McFarland, and that defendant owned the south half of the Johnson survey as described in his answer. The deeds to support the' pleas of limitation, according to the statement of facts, describe the land conveyed as the “south half” and “off the south end” of the Johnson survey, as described in defendant’s answer.
Under his pleadings, defendant could not recover any part of the McFarland survey; but if the plea of limitation had claimed or described land on the McFarland, there was no deed or deeds to defendant of any part of it. His deeds confined him to the Johnson. To maintain the-plea of five years limitation, there must not only be proof of adverse and continuous possession for the necessary period, paying the taxes, but the possession must be under deed or deeds duly registered, describing the land so claimed. The description must be such as will give notice to the owner of the claim. The owner is conclusively presumed to know the contents of the recorded deed—the description of the land—but nothing more. Had the owners of the McFarland survey read the deeds to Lusk, and from him and wife to defendant, they would have had no intimation therefrom that he was claiming any part of the McFarland. Defendant’s claim by possession was based upon the supposition or belief that the land was on the Johnson, and his plea rests his right of recovery on that fact.
The fact that it was alleged that the lines and corners were marked did not change the description which included the land within the Johnson; such marks, if any, were not given. The description in the deeds of the land—the south end of the Johnson—would still remain the same.
A deed may by mistake refer to a wrong survey and yet be sufficient to support the plea, if it otherwise, by external objects found on the ground, definitely designates the land in possession. It is not necessary to discuss the effect of such conflicting description, as no such question arises in this case. Flanagan v. Boggess, 46 Texas, 335; Kilpatrick v. Sisneros, 23 Texas, 137; Brokel v. McKechnie, 69 Texas, 32; Udell v. Peak, 70 Texas, 549; Jones v. Andrews, 62 Texas, 668.
Defendant’s possessory claim is based upon the supposition that the land is a part of the Johnson, both as regards the plea and proof. But the plea could not change the proof. By the case as made, there was no occasion for a plea of limitation, predicated on a deed, as if the land was not on the south end of the Johnson, plaintiffs could not recover it. They only showed title to the McFarland. We do not say the verdict fixing the boundary is correct, but it did fix it so as to leave the disputed land on the McFarland, where plaintiffs claim it. This was conclusive upon the jury, and the rest of their verdict was impossible. The verdict was inconsistent, and did not authorize the judgment.
The judgment was erroneous, and should be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is so ordered.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered January 18, 1893"
216201,International & Great Northern Railway Company v. J. B. Hall,1892-11-03,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
Action for damages from personal injuries received by appellee while engaged in the service of appellant repairing cars. Judgment was recovered for $3500.
The suit.was instituted November 13, 1888, and on a former trial appellant recovered judgment for $6000, which was reversed by the Supreme Court because the amount of the judgment was excessive. 78 Texas, 657.
At the time of the injury plaintiff was 25 years old. He was by occupation a house carpenter, and had been in the employ of defendant about three months in its repair yard at Palestine, repairing cars. On October 11, 1888, he was engaged at work with other workmen putting a sill in the end of a flat car. He, was between two cars, which stood two or three feet apart, when a switch engine which ran in on the repair track struck the cars' in front of him, and pushed the car on which he was at work against the next car, and broke his arm below the elbow.
A. T. Wood was foreman of the switch engine, and had charge of it in making up trains and putting cars where they belonged. Cars in bad order were taken out of trains and switched on to the repair tracks. The foreman of the switch engine or a switchman would throw the switch for that purpose. On the day of the accident Wood went in on the repair track with the switch engine to get out a couple of cars. He said: “We hallooed out to look out, the same we always do when we want to go in. I think the bell was ringing at the time. That was all the engineer had to do, and the fireman even did that. It was his duty to ring the bell, and besides that we hallooed to look out on that occasion. There were no flags out, and I did not see anybody under the cars.” There were a number of engines moving in the yards and bells were ringing; the shops were close by, and they were noisy from the beating of metal, the running of machinery, and the men at work.
Plaintiff testified, that he did not know that the engine was coming in, and that the first that he knew that anything was going to happen the cars were coming against him, and he did not have time to get out; that no one had given him notice, and that no notice at all was given. That the company had never given him any instructions about any rules it liad for giving notice, and he did not know whether they had any rules or not; that he supposed they would protect him, and that they had rules suffi-' cient for that purpose. Plaintiff was employed in the car building department, of which one, Siddons was master; he worked under a foreman named Williams, but Siddons had the authority to employ the men.
Whenever the switch engine went on to the repair track to take ears in or to bring them out, the usual notice was to halloo “ look out,” and the bell was kept ringing while the engine was moving. It was usual for the switchman or the foreman of the engine to halloo out to the men on the repair track whenever an engine came in.
The switches leading to the repair track were kept locked, and the switchman carried the key and unlocked the switch whenever it was necessary to run in an engine.
There were rules to protect the men working on the repair tracks. When an engine was about to go in on a track the rules were for the switchmen to notify the men by ringing the bell of the engine and also to halloo to the men. The foreman of the repair yard would also, if he were there, notify them. It was the duty of both the foreman of the engine and the foreman of the men to give notice. It was the rule that somebody must always, give notice. There was a conflict of evidence as to the use of flags. It was testified that the company furnished the workmen with flags, which were stuck up on the track, and that when a flag was up it was forbidden to touch a car with the engine. There was no flag up when plaintiff was injured. Some of the evidence showed that flags had not been brought into use when the accident occurred.
With respect to the injury, the plaintiff testified that his right arm was broken just below the elbow and a mark was left where it was broken; that he could not use it at all for about four months; that the arm was about a half-inch shorter and was weaker than it was before, and he could not lift much that was heavy with it; that it hurt him when he worked. It diminished his capacity as a carpenter. Before he was injured he could make $2.50 a day, but since he could only make 82.25. He worked for the defendant at 82, but that was because he got a steady job. The occupation of a carpenter required heavy lifting, and he could do no heavy work. He could not use a plane as long and as well as before, nor reach to nail overhead without a great deal of inconvenience. That his arm seemed stiff, and he could not turn his hand up without bending his elbow in toward his body; this arm was not so large as the other since it was broken, and the development of the muscle had been affected; it was not so large. The bone bulged out where it was broken.
Dr. West, a physician, testified, that the rotation of the arm was destroyed by the formation of callus between the two bones which united them; that the bone was broken near the joint, and it was unusual for a fracture of that kind to leave any use at all; that it was a comminuted fracture — that is, the bone had been broken in pieces. The arm had been shortened, he thought, from the overlapping of the bones. In a lateral strain plaintiff could bear as much pressure as he ever could, but not as much in lifting at right angles. With the bones grown together and lapped an injury of that kind would last plaintiff as long as he lived. lie thought both bones had been broken.
Dr. Colley testified, that it was a simple fracture of the ulna, the inner bone of the right arm; that the arm was well, and he did not see why plaintiff could not use it as well as he could before; there was a protuberance which might grow less. Dr. Colley was defendant company’s surgeon and treated plaintiff in the hospital of the company to which he had been taken after the accident.
Dr. West had examined plaintiff’s arm and was familiar with' its condition.
Appellant has assigned errors:
1. That the verdict is contrary to the law and the evidence, because the evidence showed that plaintiff had worked in the yard about three months before the injury, and knew all about the rules and regulations under which that work was carried on, and the methods adopted and practiced to protect the men at work, had never complained, and therefore assumed the risk of such imperfect methods, if they were imperfect.
2. The verdict of the jury was excessive in amount, under the evidence.
3. There was error in permitting plaintiff, over defendant’s objection, to prove that defendant caused danger flags to be used after plaintiff’s injury.
On the former appeal of this case the charge of the court below was the same that was given on the trial from which this appeal is had, and the Supreme Court then approved the charge, and said: “It was the duty of defendant to establish regulations which would have advised its servants who were engaged in moving cars on to the track where plaintiff was at work of his position, and it should also have provided adequate means of warning them of the approaching danger.” 78 Texas, 660. That the means of warning plaintiff of the approach of danger were inadequate, is involved in the finding of the jury under the charge of the court; and no question of that is made by the appellant; but the question is, that the plaintiff was aware of the means used and should not have continued in defendant’s service without complaint; that by doing so, he assumed whatever risk there was in so continuing. The court correctly instructed the jury, that if the defendant had failed to establish reasonable rules to protect employes, and plaintiff knew this, or by the use of ordinary care might have known it, and still continued in the employment exposed to such danger, he could not recover. Whether the plaintiff knew of the rules established for the protection of the workmen, or by the exercise of ordinary care might have known them, was a question for the determination of the jury, and for us to set aside the verdict in this respect we should be able to say that plaintiff, from his service of three months in the repair yard of the defendant, was bound to know what means, if any, were provided for the protection of the workmen, for he testified that the company had never given him any instructions as to what rules it had about giving notice; that he did not know whether it liad any rules or not, but that he was working under the supposition that it would protect him and that the rules were sufficient for that purpose; and the only evidence from which we could infer that he knew the rules, or might have known of them, was the time of service.
The defendant would not be liable for the negligence of a fellow servant of the plaintiff if it furnished adequate means and rules for the protection of the plaintiff while at work; nor would the defendant be liable, although the means furnished and the rules established were inadequate, if the plaintiff had knowledge thereof, or by the exercise of ordinary diligence might have liad knowledge thereof, and voluntarily continued in the service of the defendant. But if the precautions taken by the defendant were inadequate, and the plaintiff did not know what precautions were being taken, and was not chargeable with the want of ordinary care in failing to ascertain what the precautions were, then the defendant would be liable. We can not say that the plaintiff was guilty of negligence in failing, within the time he was in the service of the defendant, to ascertain the precautions that were being used. He was relying on the defendant to protect him, and it not having been shown that anything had occurred to attract plaintiff’s attention to just what precautions were being taken, we do not feel authorized to say that three months service in the yard would be considered evidence of negligence on his part.
While the amount of the verdict may seem large, yet plaintiff has received a permanent injury, and the usefulness of his right arm has been impaired for life. It does not appear that the jury was influenced by passion or prejudice, and we will not disturb the verdict.
It has been held that it is error to admit evidence of changes on the part of a railway company to improve the service after an accident, and properly so, although the change should have been suggested and caused by the accident itself, because it is for the public good that the operation of railways should be rendered as safe as possible. ■ But the evidence objected to, as to the use of the flags after the accident had occurred, was in rebuttal of the testimony of the witness Siddons, that flags were kept for use by employes before and at the time of Hall’s injury, and plaintiff offered the evidence for the purpose of showing that the custom of using flags was after and not before the injury to plaintiff. The evidence was to show when the flags were used, and not to show negligence by failure to use them; and the court admitted it for the purpose for which it was offered alone, and so instructed the jury. There was no error in the admission of the evidence under the circumstances.
Delivered November 3, 1892.
We find no error in the record, and the judgment of the court below will be affirmed.

219264,McCurdy & Daniels v. G. W. Bullock,1893-01-18,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
This suit, in form of trespass to try title, was brought by appellants, McCurdy & Daniels, against Gr. W. Bullock, the appellee, for the Isaac Fessenden 320 acres survey in Bosque County,
Defendant answered, that he was not in possession of the lands described in plaintiffs’ petition, and disclaimed any interest, right, title, or possession of the Isaac Fessenden 320 acres survey; but says that he is, and was at and prior to the institution of the suit, in the quiet and peaceable possession of 160 acres of land, part of the Charles E. Hawkins survey; beginning at the southeast corner of the Hawkins, “ thence north 30 west 752 varas to a tract sold J. W. Cartwright; thence south 60 west 1290 varas; thence south 30 east 752 varas; thence north 60 east 1290 varas to the beginning."" He then sets up title to the land so described by possession under the statute of five years limitation. He also pleads improvements made in good faith.
It was admitted that plaintiffs owned the Fessenden 320 acres survey, and that defendant owned the 160 acres described in his answer, in the southeast corner of the Hawkins. The Fessenden survey of 320 acres was made May 24, 1850; the Hawkins survey, of nearly 4000 acres, was patented in 1854. Its last line from its southeast corner calls to run “ thence south 60 west with Fessenden’s and Kennedy’s lines 3093 varas to the beginning,” making a part of its south line identical with the north line of the Fessenden.
The deed of Dunnan to defendant, under which he claims title by limitation under the five years statute, describes the 160 acres as out of the southeast corner of the Hawkins, describing it in his answer. There was a conflict in the testimony as to the boundary line between the Fessenden and the Hawkins. The court instructed the jury to ascertain the locality of this line and establish it; and also submitted to them a charge upon defendant’s plea of limitation.
The jury returned the following verdict: “We, the jury, find the northwest corner of a survey made for George W. Lively, from which a live oak bears north 76 west 125 varas, marked K, another marked — bears north 77 west 125 varas; thence south 60 west, partly with the south line of the McFarland survey, 1900 varas to the northwest corner in prairie; thence south 30 east 770 varas, recrossed a creek 950 varas to corner, from which a live oak bears north 54 east 26 varas, marked D, another marked E bears north 87 east 33 varas. We, the jury, further find, that the defendant has had in peaceable possession for over five years the land sued for, and we find for defendant.”
Thereupon judgment was rendered, declaring that it appeared from the verdict, “ that the north line of the Fessenden as originally located upon the ground began at the northwest corner of the George Lively survey, a pile of rocks, from which a live oak bears north 76 west 125 varas, marked It, and another live oak bears north 77 west 125 varas; thence south 60 west, partly with the south line of the McFarland survey, and at a point where the next boundary line of the said Fessenden survey would intersect said north line running north 30 west from the southwest corner of said Fessenden survey, which is a known comer.” It is then decreed, that the north line of the Fessenden 11 be and the same is hereby established”—where is not stated. The decree recites, that it further appears to the court from the verdict upon defendant’s plea of limitation, that defendant had been “in the quiet and peaceable possession of all that part of the Fessenden survey as claimed by him in his said plea of limitation, by deeds duly registered, describing the lines and corners on the ground of 160 acres out of the southeast corner of said Hawkins survey, and paying all taxes due thereon, occupying, cultivating, using, and enjoying the same for more than five years next before the filing of this suit; and it further appearing from said verdict, that the jury had found for defendant the land claimed by him as aforesaid, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed by the court, that the plaintiffs, W. H. McCurdy and N. H. Daniels, composing the firm of McCurdy & Daniels, take nothing by their suit herein, and that the defendant, George Bullock, do have and recover of and from the plaintiffs the said land claimed and occupied by them; and that the said defendant, as to plaintiffs’ said suit herein, go hence without day, and that defendant recover of and from the said W. I-I. McCurdy and N. II. Daniels, plaintiffs,” and their sureties, all costs, etc.
From this judgment the plaintiffs have appealed.
The verdict of the jury is not explicit as to where they locate the north line of the Fessenden, whether it is where the plaintiffs claim it or where the defendant claims it. The verdict adds no calls to the calls as given in the field notes of the survey that will certainly enlighten us upon this subject. The verdict adopts the call in the Fessenden as its beginning corner, that is, the northwest corner of the Lively survey, witnessed by two live oaks, and then runs the course and distance as called in the Fessenden Survey to its northwest corner in the prairie. It then runs the course and 'distance, crossing a creek, as called in the Fessenden, to its southwest corner, identifying it by the two live oak bearing trees called for in the original survey. The evidence does show that there are two live oak trees on the ground (twin trees nearly answering to the call in the original field notes) where plaintiffs claim the corner to be; the trees are too young, however, and are not marked at all. If these are the trees intended by the verdict as locating the northeast corner, then the line run from this point as stated in the verdict would fix the boundary where plaintiffs contend it is. We can not be certain that this was the conclusion of the jury, because there is testimony tending to show that the southwest corner is identified by the bearing tree marked D where the defendant says.it is. From the entire verdict, we think it does nothing more, and intends nothing more, than to adopt the field notes as given in the Fessenden survey, without finding any known point or line.
At all events, the verdict does not authorize a judgment for defendant establishing the line of the Hawkins and the Fessenden where he contends it is; and the judgment, if it does so, is incorrect.
We do not pretend that it may not be so established, but only that the verdict does not so locate it. Had the verdict so located it, there would be an end of the controversy, as the plaintiffs could not recover any land on the Hawkins survey, and there would be no necessity to notice the finding on defendant’s plea of limitation.
The court’s charge should have directed the jury, that if they found the line where defendant claimed it, to so declare, and to identify it by some known object, if the evidence furnished it. The same character of charge should have been given in case the line was found to be where plaintiffs claimed it, and, as we will hereafter see, such finding would have determined the suit.
There is no question of limitation in the case, and, as insisted by appellants, no such issue should have been submitted to the jury. The deed read in evidence by defendant as a basis for his plea of limitation under the five years statute purports to convey a part of the Hawkins survejq and calls for no external objects that could place the survey outside the Hawkins. It would not authorize a recovery under the five years statute of any part of the Fessenden, wherever it proves to be. Possession and payment of taxes could only mature the deed into a good title; it could not amend the description of the land or apply the deed to other land.
In this respect, the same question is raised in this case as in the case of' these plaintiffs, McCurdy & Daniels, against Locker, ante, p. 220, to which we refer.
We are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded; and it is so ordered.
Reversed and remanded.

216199,B. F. Ivey v. J. W. Harrell et al.,1892-11-03,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Action of trespass to try title by appellant against appellees, to recover a tract of 540 acres of land, part of the Daniel Reel league. Appellees pleaded various defenses, but one of which need be stated. That was a plea setting up as a bar to this action a former judgment of the District Court of' Rusk County. Appellant in reply to this plea asserted that the judgment was void, for the reasons hereinafter considered. The parties to that judgment were not made parties to this suit, and there was no prayer for reviewing or setting it aside.
The case was tried by the court without a jury, and a judgment rendered for the appellees, on the ground that the former judgment precluded appellant from recovering.
There is no statement of facts, but the findings of law and fact of the district judge are in the record, and the question for determination here is, whether or not the conclusion of law that such former judgment was not void, but bound plaintiff, was correct.
In order to reverse that ruling, it must affirmatively appear to be wrong-from the facts found, for we are without any other means of reviewing it.
The material facts thus found are: That plaintiff, prior to that judgment, had title to an undivided interest in the land sued for; that in 1875, there was pending in the District Court of Rusk County a suit in which Berry and others were plaintiffs and Ilarnage and others defendants, which involved what is called the west quarter of the Reel league. In that suit, in 1875, two separate pleas of intervention were filed, one by the Flanagans and one by the Iveys. Among the latter were the appellant and his brothers, who were joint owners with him. Appellant at that time was a minor, but several of his brothers who intervened with him were adults, and had employed attorneys to represent them in the intervention. The minutes of the court recite that the intervenors appeared, and that S. R. Whitley was appointed guardian ad litem for plaintiff, and that lie qualified by giving the bond fixed by the court and taking oath as required by law.
It appears by the two interventions that the north quarter of the Reel league, of which the land in controversy is a part, was introduced into the-litigation in that suit. A trial was had at the August Term, 1875, at. which all the parties, plaintiffs, defendants, and intervenors, including plaintiff represented by his guardian ad litem, appeared. A verdict was. rendered as to the matters in issue between the plaintiffs and defendants, and a judgment was rendered thereon settling the title to the west quarter of the league. An agreement was then presented to the court between the intervenors, settling their controversies as to the north quarter, and a judgment was entered in accordance therewith for partition of that pait of the league among the several claimants. Appellee was represented in this agreement and judgment by his guardian ad litem.
After the judgment was rendered an execution for costs issued against the Iveys, and was levied on all their interest in the Reel league. At the sale, N. G-. Bagley, who was their attorney in that suit, bought in the land for $10. It was worth $500 or $600. It does not appear that any of the defendants are claiming under that sale, Bagley’s representatives not being made parties.
It is claimed by appellant that the judgment was void because he was not legally a party to the suit. The law then in force provided for the appointment of a special guardian to take care of the interests of a minor in a suit pending or about to be commenced, to which such minor was a proper party, such appointment to be made by the court in which the suit was pending or about to be commenced. Pasch. Dig., arts. 6969, 6970. Before that statute was passed, and since its repeal, minors could sue by next friend, and there is nothing in those provisions which would prevent a suit or an intervention being brought before the court in that manner. The brothers of appellant brought him into court by the plea of intervention, and in the absence of the record showing to the contrary it would be presumed, if necessary to support the action of the court, that in so doing they acted in the capacity of next friend.
The fact that the proceeding was an intervention could not affect the question, for intervenors may occupy the position of either plaintiffs or defendants, and all the elements of a cause of action or ground of defense may be contained in such pleading. Parties may come into court by that method as effectually as by original suit. When they were introduced into the suit it was proper for the court to appoint guardians for them. Bond v. Dillard, 50 Texas, 309.
We must conclude therefore that the plaintiff was before the court in the case of Berry v. Harnage in such a manner as to give that court jurisdiction over his person. Martin v. Weyman, 26 Texas, 468.
The fact that the judgment was rendered on the agreement of the guardian does not render it void. The guardian acted under the supervision of the court, and, in a collateral proceeding, it must be presumed that the court ascertained the facts upon which the agreement was based and al lowed no wrong done to the minor.
It might be erroneous for a court to base its judgment upon an agreement of the guardian, but this would not render its action void. It is the judgment which binds, and not the agreement. Ilollis v. Dasliiell, 52 Texas, 187.
If, by the interventions in the ease of Berry v. Harnage, other land was improperly introduced as the subject of the. controversy, the action of the court in allowing it might be irregular, but its jurisdiction would not be affected. A state of facts might be supposed"" in which it would have been proper to bring all of the land in, in order to adjust controversies and rights which extended through all of it. Whether such a case was made by the pleadings or not, parties were before the court seeking to litigate over a subject of which it had jurisdiction, and its judgment entertaining and determining their suit can not be collaterally attacked.
The judgment as between the intervenors is found by the court below to be a part of the final judgment settling the controversy of the plaintiffs and defendants, and there is no merit in appellant’s contention that it is a separate decree.
This can not be treated as a direct proceeding to set aside the judgment. The allegations and prayer of the petition show no such object, and none of the parties to that judgment are before the court. The same may be said as to the execution sale to Bagley. His representatives are not made parties, and it is not made to appear that any of the defendants hold under that sale. Neither the pleadings nor the findings of the judge show that the proper parties are before the court to enable us to pass upon the validity of that sale.
Delivered November 3, 1892.
The court below was right in treating the suit simply as an action of trespass to try title, and not one to review and set aside the judgment and the sale to Bagley, and its judgment should be affirmed.

This suit was brought by August Garteiser,. against the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company, to-recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him through the alleged negligence of defendant, its agents and employes, on the 25th day of March, 1887, while plaintiff was in the act of crossing a bridge on a hand car on the line of defendant’s railway.
Among other matters, the defendant’s answer contained a general denial and a plea of contributory negligence.
The specific charges of negligence in the plaintiff’s petition, are:
1. Failure to ring the bell or blow the whistle upon the part of defendant’s employes when the train which occasioned the accident in question approached and crossed a certain public road near the bridge.
2. The excessive rate of speed at which the train was running at the time.
A verdict and judgment were rendered in favor of the defendant, and plaintiff has appealed.
The assignments of error are numerous, and complain of nearly every paragraph of the court’s charge, and of its refusal to give certain special instructions asked by plaintiff.
At the time in question, the Southern Pacific Railway Company had possession of and was operating appellee’s railway, and one Heinemann had a contract with saifl company to fence the right of way of the railway. Appellant and five other men were employed by Heinemann to assist him, and together they constituted what was called “the fence gang.” They were furnished by the company with a hand car to transport themselves and tools from place to place on the road, as their work required. This car was furnished to Heinemann under his contract with the company. Appellant had no contract with the company.
There is some conflict in the testimony as to the particular instructions Heinemann had received from the representative of the company who employed him, as to the care he should observe in crossing bridges, passing curves, etc.
On the morning of March 25, 1887, Heinemann and his fence gang started on the hand car from Seguin to the place of their work, over two miles east of Seguin. To reach their destination they had to pass over the Gerónimo bridge, on appellee’s railway. The weather was foggy, and when they got about half across the bridge they saw a freight train approaching and about to cross the bridge from the opposite direction. The threatened collision between the train and the hand car was not known by those operating either in time to avert it. The collision occurred ; the men on the hand car jumped off, and appellant fell through the bridge and was injured. The train was going west and the hand car east. There was a public road crossing the railway not far east of the bridge, and the railway track made a curve near the bridge, on the east side of the stream.
There is conflict in the testimony as to the rate of speed at which the train was moving, and as to signals (whistle and bell) at the road crossing, and between there and the bridge. The train was an extra, not running on schedule time.
Appellant testified, that he was acquainted with the road where the accident curred; knew that the railway ran across the public road east of and near the bridge; that when he and his associates reached the bridge, they stopped and listened for trains and could hear none.
The first, second, and third paragraphs of the charge contain only a statement of the issues in the case and an introduction to the succeeding paragraphs. Paragraphs 10 and 11 are abstract propositions, and do not bear on any special fact in this case.
Paragraphs 14 and 15 relate to statutory signals at road crossings, and therein the jury are told that said signals are solely for the benefit and protection of parties on the road crossing, and that a failure to give said signals would not be negligence so far as plaintiff was concerned; and that it would be sufficient if the whistle was blown before reaching the crossing.
In the fourth, seventh, eighth, and twelfth paragraphs the jury are told, in substance, that the railway company has the right to make rules to regulate the running of trains and hand cars on its railway; that all persons using hand cars are bound to know, of and to obey these rules. That any notice of such rules given to Heinemann was notice to plaintiff; and that if the company had rules requiring flagmen to be sent out ahead of hand cars in foggy weather, then if the jury believe the weather was foggy at the time of the accident, and no flagman was sent out in advance of the hand car, and that the failure to so flag the train caused the collision, then plaintiff could not recover. That if the rules of the railway company did not require signals by bell or whistle to be given by the train which collided with the hand car, on account of fogs, or on approaching bridges, etc., and that if said rules only required such signals to be given when approaching road crossings, or when in dangerous proximity to obstructions upon it road track, and such obstructions are discovered by some of the employes in charge of the train, then it was not negligence on the part of the employes not to have blown the whistle of said train after passing the first public road crossing east of the bridge. And the fourth paragraph, in effect, told the jury that appellant was chargeable with the contributory negligence of Heinemann, if the latter was guilty of any.
In paragraphs 5,6, and 9 the jury are told that a railway company has the right to run extra or special trains on its roads whenever it deems it proper to do so, and that all persons rightfully on the track are chargeable with notice of this fact. That a person rightfully on the track can only expect from the company such care and consideration as it owes to the general public, and has no right to expect anything more, and is bound to use the highest degree of care to protect himself from accidents.
The fifth, sixth, and ninth paragraphs of the charge required appellant to exercise a degree of care greater than that imposed upon him by law. He was not a trespasser, nor was he on the railway track by mere courtesy or permission. A fair construction of the testimony shows that Heinemann and his employes, under his contract with the company, had a legal right to the use of the track in the manner they were using it. Of course this right was subordinate to the company’s right to run its trains on the track; and whenever it became necessary for one to yield its use to the other, the right of the company was superior. Under these circumstances, it was not proper to instruct the jury that appellant was required to exercise “the highest degree of care.” While expressions in text books and decisions may be found stating as a fact that persons on the track of a railway are requirad to use the highest degree of care to protect themselves, still, without qualification, it is not in a case of this character an accurate statement of the law, and should not, under the rules that prevail in this State, be given as a charge to a jury.
All that the law required of appellant on the occasion in question, was the exercise of such care for his own safety as ordinarily prudent persons would have exercised under like circumstances; and the court could not legitimately tell the jury that such care was “the highest degree of care.” Railway v. Dyer, 76 Texas, 156; Railway v. Garcia, 75 Texas, 583; Railway v. Brin, 77 Texas, 174; Artusy v. Railway, 73 Texas, 191.
Although in Brown v. Griffin, 71 Texas, 654, a charge is approved which appears to encroach upon it, the rule obtains in this State, that in the absence of a statute or other express provision of law declaring a particular act or omission unlawful, the court can not properly instruct the jury that such act or omission constitutes negligence. Railway v. Murphy, 46 Texas, 356; Railway v. Chapman, 57 Texas, 82; Railway v. Lee, 70 Texas, 496; Railway v. Hill, 71 Texas, 451; Campbell v. Trimble, 75 Texas, 270; Railway v. Anderson, 76 Texas, 244; Calhoun v. Railway, 84 Texas, 226. The fourth, seventh, eighth, and twelfth paragraphs of the charge contravened this rule.
As regards rules and regulations by the company for the government of hand cars on its road, it was not permissible for the court to do more than tell the jury, that if there was proof of such rules or regulations, and it was shown that appellant knew, or by the use of ordinary diligence might have known, of such rules or regulations, then that fact might be considered by the jury in determining whether or not he had been guilty of contributory negligence. Railway v. Lamothe, 76 Texas, 220.
That portion of the charge which instructed the jury, that the statutory signals required to be given by railway trains when they approach and cross public roads or streets were for the sole benefit of-persons travelling such roads and streets, and that a failure to give them would not be negligence as to persons travelling on the railroad track, was incorrect. It was held in Railway v. Gray, 65 Texas, 32, that while the primary object of the statute was the protection of persons using the public roads and streets, that as to persons rightfully travelling in hand cars on railway tracks, whether or not a failure to give such signals would constitute negligence must be determined by the jury. Appellant asked a charge embodying the doctrine announced in that case, and the refusal of the court to give it was error.
The fifteenth paragraph of the charge was inaccurate in not stating the distance from the crossing that the signals are to be given; and the latter part of it, telling the jury that if the whistle was blown the failure to ring the bell would not be negligence, was violative of the rule already referred to, denying the right of the court to tell the jury that any given .state of facts will or will not constitute negligence.
The court also erred in charging that notice of the company’s rules to Heinemann would be notice to appellant. If the former had been the agent of the latter, the charge might have been correct. But the evidence shows the reverse. Heinemann was the master and appellant his servant.
For a like reason, the court was wrong in charging that co-operative negligence on the part of Heinemann would be imputed to appellant, and preclude his right of recovery, if otherwise any existed.
Under the English rule, as declared in Thorogood v. Bryan, 8 Common Bench, 115, this holding would be correct; but the American doctrine, as settled by the great weight of authority, is, that the negligence of another person, not participated in by the plaintiff, will not be attributed to him unless he has some right of control over such person, or they are, on terms of equality, engaged in a joint enterprise. In some States there are exceptions to this rule, when suits are brought for persons non sui juris, and contributory negligence of parents, guardians, etc., is interposed as a defense.
In support of the general rule, the following authorities are referred to: Beach on Con. Neg., beginning on page 103; 4 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 82, and cases there cited; Little v. Hackett, 116 U. S., 366; Railway v. Kutac, 72 Texas, 643; Markham v. Navigation Co., 73 Texas, 247.
The general objection to the charge, that it gave undue prominence to appellee’s side of the case and minimized appellant’s, thereby indicating to the jury that in the opinion of the court appellant was not entitled to recover, is to some extent true. This results, however, from the court’s-misapprehension of the law applicable to the case, and not through any design to improperly influence the jury. Besides, it is to some extent, cured by the special charge asked by appellant and given, which presented the appellant’s theory of the case affirmatively to the jury.
For the errors pointed out in the charge of the court, the judgment is reversed and cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered January 18, 1893."
216237,John R. Wallace et al. v. H. B. Pruitt et al.,1892-11-03,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellants sued appellees in the District Court of Leon County in trespass to try title, to recover 720 acres of land, a part of the M. Skinner league. Appellees pleaded not guilty and the statute of limitations. At the trial appellants showed that they were the heirs of B. R. Wallace, and proved a regular chain of title from the State to R. J. Towns. They then offered in evidence the following document, which had been duly recorded in Leon County:
'""■The State of Texas, County of Travis. — Whereas, Benjamin R. Wallace and myself are the joint and equal owners of several tracts of land, situate in Leon County, in this State, viz., a league of land granted to Skinner, a league of land granted to Midkiff, and one-half of the league of land granted to Allen, which tracts are more particularly described in the deed of Nathaniel Robbins to me, on record in the County Court of Leon County; now, know all men by these presents, that I, Robert J. Towns, do by these presents authorize and empower the said Wallace to sell any portion of said land, not exceeding one-half thereof, and to make title thereof in our joint names and apply the proceeds thereof to his own use; the title to the purchaser to be made with special warranty.
“ Witness my hand and scroll for seal, this 20th day of November, 1855.
“R. J. Towns.” [Seal]
Appellees objected to its admission in evidence; because, first, it was not a deed of conveyance; second, the recitals therein were not evidence against defendants, who rely on their possession, and are strangers thereto; third, it did not estop R. J. Towns, because not shown to have been acted upon. The court sustained the objections, and excluded the document, to which appellants duly excepted.
Appellants also offered a deed from the tax collector of Leon County to Pruitt, one of the defendants, for part of the land in controversy, reciting a sale and conveyance of it as the property of “an unknown owner,” for the purpose of showing common source. This, upon objection that an unknown owner was not a common source, and that defendants relied upon their possession, was excluded. It was shown in connection with this Offer that' the defendants, except1 one, claimed under Pruitt.
Thereupon judgment was rendered for appellees, the judge in his conclusions of law holding that the instrument did not connect appellants with the title shown to be in Towns. The appellees showed no title in themselves. From this judgment the present appeal is prosecuted, and the decisive question is, whether or not the instrument signed by Towns was sufficient to vest in Wallace title, legal or equitable, to an interest in the lands.
Appellants contend that the recital of a joint legal ownership in Wallace estopped Towns, and was admissible to show the acquisition of his legal title to one-half by Wallace; and that even if such recital has not the effect of an estoppel, it is prima facie evidence of such acquisition of title, and therefore admissible.
Appellants contend that the statement was only an ex liarte admission of Towns, not shown to have been acted upon, and not evidence against them; and that even if it estopped Towns, it could have no effect against strangers to the instrument.
That the maker of a deed may be estopped to deny the truth of recitals therein, is a well settled doctrine of the common law.
Says Greenleaf: “In regard to recitals in deeds, the general rule is, that all parties to a deed are bound by the recitals therein, which operate as an estoppel, working on the interest in the land if it be a deed of conveyance, and binding both parties and privies; privies in blood, privies in estate, and privies in law. Between such parties and privies the deed or other matter recited need not at any time be otherwise proved, the recital of it in the subsequent deed being conclusive. Thus the recital of a lease in a deed of release is conclusive evidence of the existence of the lease against the parties and all others claiming under them in privity of estate.” 1 Greenl. Ev., sec. 23.
Bigelow, after tracing the history of the rule, and showing that it arose from the peculiar efficacy once given to an instrument by the use of a seal, and referring to modern legislation dispensing with the use of ""seals, says: “In such States the question of estoppel by statements and recitals in written instruments must depend upon intention, to be determined (from the writing itself) by the consideration whether the statement or recital was designed to furnish a basis of action by the parties; in other words, whether they intended to bind themselves, to contract, that the facts should be as stated.” Bige. on Estop., 269.
“ Where the recital involves a contract, it estops; if it does not involve a contract, it operates only as a unilateral general admission, and is open to explanation. But a recital in-a deed, though not estopping, may make, •even against the heirs of the grantor, a prima facie case.” 2 Whart. Ev., sec. 1040.
' The general doctrine of estoppel arising from recitals in deeds, has been recognized by our Supreme Court. Hardy v. De Leon, 5 Texas, 243, 244; Williams v. Chandler, 25 Texas, 11.
The instrument signed by Towns evidently came within the rules, above quoted from Bigelow and Wharton, for determining whether or not a particular recital works an estoppel against the grantor and his privies. It was evidently intended to “ furnish a basis for action” to Wallace, and “to contract” that the fact should be as stated; for the instrument proceeds, in view of the fact of joint ownership, to clothe Wallace with full lawful power to secure his interest out of the lands -by a sale, and the execution of joint conveyances by special warranty. The recital involved a contract with Wallace, which is stated by Wharton as the test by which its effect as an estoppel is to be determined. As against Towns, and all parties claiming under him, the instrument would therefore be admissible in evidence; and whether we hold that it would create against them an estoppel or not, it would certainly make a prima facie case.
The case of Burk v. Turner, 79 Texas, 276, is referred to by both parties. In that case there was no general discussion of the doctrine of estoppel by deed. Both parties claimed under one who had conveyed to two persons a land certificate, reciting in his deed a complete chain of title to himself.
The plaintiff proved no chain of title to this grantor, but relied on common source and the recital in the deed. The defendant, while holding title to one-half the land under this conveyance, also asserted that the common grantor had no chain of title, but that the title had remained in others, from whom such grantor claimed to have acquired it, and that as against them he (defendant) had perfected title by limitation.
The court say: “The recital of a particular fact is at least evidence against the parties to the conveyance and their privies. It follows that the facts stated in the conveyance from Lane to George J. Turner and R. J. Turner were prima facie proved by the introduction in evidence of that conveyance as against the defendant, who received a deed and went into possession of the land under that title. The burden was then shifted upon the defendant, and in order to defeat the action it was incumbent upon him to show that the recital as to one or more of the conveyances was not true. The deed of Lane was evidence for him as well as against him; and if he had shown that either Ashby, the original grantee, Clare, Manifee, or Hodges had never transferred the certificate, and that he had acquired the title of either by the statute of limitation, he would have been entitled to a judgment, unless we should hold him estopped, which we are not now prepared to do.” The defendant had failed to show these facts, and judgment was therefore against him. So this case does not, as we understand it, either reject or affirm the doctrine of estoppel by recitals in deeds.
However, if the instrument from Towns to Wallace was admissible against appellees at all, the decision of the question before us would be the same, whether it estopped Towns and his privies or was only prima facie evidence.
It is clear that as against Towns and his heirs, and other parties holding under him, the instrument would have been admissible, and sufficient at least to make a prima facie case. But appellees claim that they were strangers to the document, and therefore not to be affected by it. The attitude in which the case stood when the paper was offered was this: The evidence showed legal title in Towns, with appellants seeking by this document to show that their ancestor had acquired title from or with him to an interest in it; and appellees, by their objection, standing on their possession and asserting the title to be still in Towns. Any transaction the effect of which would be to vest Towns’ title to the land or a part of it in appellants was, for the mere purpose of deraigning title, admissible, though it might appear to be entirely between Towns and Wallace, and although appellees may not have been parties to it. The mere fact that appellees would not be bound by such transaction would not render it inadmissible to prove title in appellants through Towns, for a deed of conveyance or a judgment between Wallace and Towns would not estop them unless they claimed under it.
There is no doubt that the authorities all say that a recital in a deed does not estop strangers to it, but only parties and their privies in blood, in estate, or in law. Washburn, after stating this rule, adds: “ But a person in possession, sustaining his possession by no other title than a denial that a former owner had parted with his right, is not a stranger. He becomes privy in estate to him whose title he maintains, and is concluded by what destroys it in. his hands. For, if title can be traced by B to A, and B can fasten upon A the incapacity of asserting his right in consequence of his admission that he has conveyed to B, it is not just that one standing on A’s claim only, and relying on no superior right, should be permitted to contest the existence of a fact which those interested have settled.” 3 Washb. Real Prop., secs. 49, 50. He refers to Kinsman v. Loomis, 11 Ohio St., 478, and other authorities.
Bigelow states the same proposition (Estoppel, p. 280), and refers to the same ease without criticism.
In that case one of the deeds in plaintiff’s title recited the execution of another deed necessary to complete the chain. The deed thus recited was not otherwise shown. The defendants showed no paper title, but stood upon their possession, claiming, as do the appellees here, that the recital did not bind them, and did not, as against them, prove the former deed. But the court held that it did, and, after using the language above quoted from Washburn, adds: “ The law therefore wisely attaches the disability of A to all who maintain his title, and permits such estoppels to be used not merely defensively, but to sustain actions of ejectment. 2 Hill Abr., 401.
“The present case affords a proper application of these rules. The sole defense consists in maintaining an outstanding title in Swift; but a fact is shown by Swift’s admission which proves this title has no existence, and that the estate has passed to plaintiff, an admission which binds not Swift only and his heirs and assignees, but all who seek protection under the shelter of his name.” 11 Ohio St., 479.
These expressions are so applicable to this case and dispose so fully of the question before us, that we need add nothing to them. We do not wish to be understood as holding, however, that appellees are estopped by the recital in Towns’ deed from showing any defense to the action or any title to the land. We mean only to decide that the instrument can be used to deraign title from Towns.
There is another view of that document which equally entitles appellants to use it as evidence. It recites that the subscriber and Wallace are the joint equal owners of the land, and the evidence as it stood at the trial shows that the absolute legal title was in Towns. The effect of the deed was therefore to acknowledge that Towns was holding the land to the extent of one-half in trust for Wallace. The instrument was good as an acknowledgment or declaration of a trust.
“ There is no particular formality required or necessary in the creation of a trust, and the statute of frauds will be satisfied if the trust can be manifested or proved by any subsequent acknowledgment by the trustee, as by an express declaration, or any memorandum to that effect, or by letter under his hand, or by his answer in chancery, or b.y his affidavit, or by a recital in a bond or deed, or by a pamphlet written by the trustees.” 2 Perry on Trusts, sec. 82.
“But if there is an absolute conveyance of the legal title to the supposed trustee, and there is no declaration of a trust prior to or at the time of the conveyance by the grantor, and the cestui que trust attempts to charge the grantee with a trust in respect to the land, he must produce some writing signed by the grantee of the legal title in order to charge him with the trust.” Perry on Trusts, sec. 83.
Pomeroy (2 Equity Jurisprudence, sec. 1007) says: “When the trust is not created in and by the instrument of conveyance, it may be sufficiently declared and evidenced by the trustee to whom the land is conveyed or who becomes the holder of the legal title; and this may be done by a writing executed simultaneously with or subsequent to the conveyance, and such writing may be of the most informal nature.”
Numerous illustrations of the doctrine, in adjudged cases, are given by these authors. The one most nearly in point, which we have examined, is in Insurance Company v. Campbell, 95 Illinois, 267, in which the holder of an absolute deed to land gave written notice, signed by her, that it in fact belonged to a named beneficiary. The court held this a sufficient declaration of the trust.
Delivered November 3, 1892.
We therefore conclude from these authorities,, that even if we should hold that by the deed the legal title to one-half the land did not pass from Towns to Wallace by estoppel, that instrument is still’ sufficient to show an equitable title in Wallace to such half, and that this would be sufficient to entitle appellants to recover, until appellees show some superior right.
This mates it unnecessary to pass upon the ruling as to the tax deed: Had the deed from Towns to Wallace been properly excluded there would have been no reversible error in ruling out the tax deed. It did not show that defendants held under Towns; and if it had, appellants could not connect themselves with him without the instrument we have been considering. The rule as to common source had no application. No other facts were shown that would have given effect to the tax deed in appellants’ favor.
Because of the error of the court in excluding the instrument from Towns to Wallace, the judgment is reversed and the case remanded.
"" Reversed and remanded."
219108,H. Schultze v. Alamo Ice and Brewing Company et al.,1893-01-18,"KEY, Associate Justice.
Appellant brought this suit against the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, a corporation, for the recovery of a debt and foreclosure of a mechanic’s and builder’s lien on certain real estate in the city of San Antonio. There were several other defendants, only one of whom, S. D. Scudder, contested appellant’s alleged lien. Some disclaimed, and others made default. The Alamo Ice and Brewing Company was one of the latter.
Appellee Scudder averred in his answer, that prior to the accrual of appellant’s alleged lien, the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company executed a deed of trust on the property, to secure a debt for borrowed money, to himself and W. J. B. Patterson for $15,000, and that in pursuance of the trust deed it was sold to said Scudder. He also averred that he was the owner of a judgment lien against the property superior to appellant’s asserted lien.
The trial court filed findings of facts, which we adopt, as follows:
“1. That the defendant the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company is indebted to the plaintiff, H. Schultze, in the sum of $1824.51 principal, and $174.30 interest, aggregating the sum of $1998.81.
“ 2. That said debt found to-be due the plaintiff is so due him for labor and material furnished by him to the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, under a contract with said company for the construction of a house or factory situated upon the lot of land described in the pleadings, and being 1 all that certain tract or parcel of land lying and being in the State of Texas, county of Bexar, within the corporate limits of the city of San Antonio, on the corner of West Houston and Cameron Streets, bounded on the north by said West Houston Street, on the east by said Cameron Street, on the south by the old Odet property, and on the west by San Pedro Creek.’
“ It is further found as a fact, that said material and labor so furnished by plaintiff to said defendant toward and upon the improvements on said property was furnished between the 1st day of March, 1887, and the 14th day of December, 1887. That the account attached to the plaintiff’s petition, amounting to $2624.50, for said labor and material, is correct, except that on February 16, 1888, plaintiff received from said company $800 in the capital stock of said company, and allowed credit accordingly.
“ 3. The court further finds as a fact, that previous to December 14, 1887, the defendant the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, being unable to construct the wood and frame work necessary for the support of the iron and tin work yet to be done by plaintiff, the plaintiff, with consent of said defendants, stopped work and delivery of materials. That plaintiff did on said 14th day of December, 1887, and within less than four months after the accrual of his said debt, file for registration in the office of the county clerk of Bexar County the itemized account of his said claim, verified by affidavit as the same appears in exhibit A, attached to plaintiff’s petition, and did cause the same to be recorded; said exhibit A, with the affidavits and certificates thereto attached, being now here referred to by the court, and not deemed necessary to be herein copied, because said exhibit shows fully the steps taken.
“The court further finds, that plaintiff made the verbal contract for said labor and material furnished with the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company substantially as alleged by him, and performed said contract substantially as alleged by him, until further performance was prevented by said defendant in the manner aforesaid.
“ 4. That in February and March, 1887, and up to and until the 3d day of November, 1887, the Alamo Ice Company was the owner of the lot of land on which said building was constructed, and on that day the said Alamo Ice Company conveyed the said land to the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, by deed duly executed, acknowledged, and recorded.
“5. That the Alamo Ice Company was chartered on the 23d day of May, 1881, for the purpose of manufacturing and selling ice and such other articles as the machinery used in making ice may be adapted to.
“ 6. That the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company was chartered on the 12th day of October, 1886, for the purpose of manufacturing ice and beer.
“ 7. That the officers and some of the stockholders of the Alamo Ice Company and the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company in February and March, 1887, were identical, J. H. Smye being the president, and W. C. Peters the secretary of the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, and having held those positions in the Alamo Ice Company prior to selling out. And in in the fall of 1886, Smye and Peters, having received new stock in lieu of it, transferred their stock in the Alamo Ice Company to the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, subject to some debts for which a portion of it was pledged. That this stock so transferred constituted a majority of the capital stock of the Alamo Ice Company. That the other stockholders made transfers of their stock from time to time until the 15th of November, 1887, before it was all transferred and new stock of the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company issued in place of it.
“ 8. That on the 10th day of November, 1887, the Phil Best Brewing Company recovered a judgment in the Federal court at San Antonio, against the Alamo Ice Company, otherwise known as the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, for $3145.12, an abstract of which was duly filed, indexed, and recorded in the records of the office of the county clerk of Bexar County on the 11th day of November, 1887, at 2:30 o’clock p. m.
“9. That on the 15th day of November, 1887, the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, through its proper officers, made a deed of trust on the property in the angle of Houston and Cameron Streets, heretofore described, to secure three notes of $5000 each, which deed of trust named H. P. Drought as trustee, and was duly recorded on the 15th day of November, 1887.
“ 10. That the judgment in the United States court in the case of the Phil Best Brewing Company v. Alamo Ice Company was rendered on the 11th day of November, 1887, and execution was issued thereon on the 29th day of December, 1887, and returned 6 by order of the plaintiffs attorney’ on the 5th day of May, 1888.
“11. That from the 1st of March, 1887, until the 3d day of November, 1887, the possession of the lot of land and the improvements and plant thereon was in J. H. Smye and W. C. Peters, who were stockholders, directors, and officers in the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, and held the same positions in the Alamo Ice Company prior to selling out and transferring their stock in that company.”
And the following is added, as further findings of facts by this court:
12. The testimony further shows, that in 1886, J. H. Smye, its president, and W. C. Peters, its secretary, owned six-tenths of the capital stock of the Alamo Ice Company; that the firm of Leroux & Cosgrove and Alfred Giles owned the remaining four-tenths of its capital stock. That the owners of a majority of said stock determined to enlarge the business by including therein the manufacture of beer, and for that purpose the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company was chartered and organized; all the stockholders of the Alamo Ice Company agreed to this change in the business except Giles, and it was not shown that appellant knew of his objecting until after he furnished the labor and material constituting the debt sued on. That appellant was engaged to furnish said labor and material by said Smye and Peters, president and secretary of the two corporations, while they were in possession of and managing the property. That part of the same was furnished after November 3, 1887, though what proportion is not shown. That Smye and Peters considered themselves in possession of the property for the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company at the time they employed appellant. That appellant did not know the condition of the title to the property until in December, 1887.
13. It was shown that all the stockholders of the Alamo Ice Company except Giles knew that appellant was furnishing labor and material to build the house on the land in question, and none of them objected.
14. The testimony also shows that the three notes for $5000 each, mentioned in the ninth finding of the court below, were made to Patterson & Scudder, and were for borrowed money, part of which was used in the construction of the improvements on the lot in controversy, and that said debt was secured by the trust deed referred to in said finding. Patterson admitted in his answer that his partner, Scudder, had acquired all the rights of Patterson & Scudder under the deed of trust to the property in question.
15. At the time of taking the trust deed, Scudder caused the record to be searched, and found no encumbrances on the property.
The District Court rendered judgment for appellant against the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company for the amount of his debt; but held, that on the facts shown he had never acquired a lien on the real estate in question. It was also held, that appellee Scudder under his pleadings and proof was not entitled to affirmative relief, and was given judgment for his costs onty.
1. As appellee Scudder failed to connect himself with the recorded judgment in favor of the Phil Best Brewing Company, and lias assigned no error upon the action of the court in excluding evidence offered for that purpose, we deem it unnecessary to specially consider that branch of the case.
2. Appellant alleged in his petition that the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company was the owner of the land at the time the contract for labor and material was made, and said company, as defendant, filed no answer, but made default. Under these circumstances, as against this company, appellant was not required to prove its ownership of the land at the time the contract in question was made; and as the record does not show that the trust deed to secure the mone3’"" borrowed by said company from Patterson & Scudder has ever been foreclosed, he was, at least, entitled to a judgment establishing and foreclosing his lien against the property in question, subject to the Patterson & Scudder debt. In other words, as the evidence does not show that the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company’s equity of redemption has been sold and bought in by Scudder, as alleged in his answer, and as the company made default, appellant was entitled to a judgment subjecting the company’s right of redemption to the satisfaction of his debt.
3. Appellant contends, however, that he is entitled to a judgment establishing his lien against the property and according it priority over the mortgage lien of Patterson & Scudder, or any right or title dependent upon their mortgage. On the other hand, Scudder resists this contention, and claims, that as the mortgagor, the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, had no title to the land upon which the house was built at the time it contracted with appellant to furnish labor and material for its construction, appellant could not, and did not, acquire a lien on the property, although said company acquired title thereto prior to the execution of the mortgage under which appellee claims', and pending performance by appellant of his part of the contract.
These diverse propositions present the principal, if not the controlling, question in the case. The trial court concurred in the views urged by counsel for Scudder, and held that appellant never acquired any lien on the property.
In this ruling we think there was error.
In this State, builders’ and mechanics’ liens rest upon both constitutional and statutory provisions of law. The former is in the following language: “Mechanics, artisans, and material men of every class shall, have a lien upon the buildings and articles made or repaired by them, for the value of their labor done thereon or material furnished therefor; and. the Legislature shall provide by law for the speedy and efficient enforcement of said liens.” Const., art. 16, sec. 37.
So much of the statute relating to this subject as bears upon the questions involved in this case reads as follows: “Any person or firm, lumber dealer, artisan, or mechanic, who may labor or furnish material, machinery, fixtures, and tools to erect any house or improvement, or to repair any building or improvement whatever, under or by virtue of any contract with the owner or proprietor thereof, or his agent, trustee, or contractor, upon complying with the provisions of this act, shall have a lien on such house,” etc. Rev. Stats., art. 3164.
It is true, perhaps, that a strict interpretation of the statute will limit-its benefits to those who furnish labor, material, etc., under a contract with the owner, or with his agent, trustee, or contractor, made while he is such owner.
But in view of the broad language of the Constitution and our statutory provision which declares that the rule of the common law, that statutes in derogation thereof shall be strictly construed, shall have no application to the Revised Statutes, and that the provisions thereof shall be liberally construed, with a view to effect their objects and to promote justice (General Provisions Revised Statutes, section 3), we do not think this interpretation ought to prevail in this case.
Mr. Jones, in his treatise on Liens, section 1248, uses this language: “ One having merely a contract for the purchase of land can not subject the freehold to a mechanic’s lien, although he subsequently, after the completion of the work for which a lien is claimed, takes a conveyance of the fee in pursuance of a contract.”
A number of cases are cited by this author to support the doctrine announced, many of which have very little and some have no application. The strongest case referred to is that of Howard v. Veazie, 3 Gray, 233. In this and all other cases cited by this author to support the text, rights, of third persons differing from the rights of the parties to the contract were involved.
In the case mentioned, the Massachusetts lien statute was construed. In that State it is provided, that 11 such lien shall not attach unless the contract is made in writing and signed by the owner of the land, or some person duly authorized by him, and recorded in the registry of deeds for the county where the land lies.” The same statute declares, that “if the person who procures the work to be done has an estate for life only, or any other estate less than a fee simple, in the land on which the work is to be done, he shall nevertheless be considered as the owner for the purposes of this chapter, to the extent of his right and interest in the land, and the lien before provided for shall bind his whole estate and interest therein.”
It was held by the court, that the word “ owner,” as used in that statute, had reference to the time of the execution of the contract; and it was also held, that the lien was dependent upon and existed when the written contract was executed and recorded.
The cases of Hayes v. Fessenden, 106 Massachusetts, 228, and Middleton Savings Bank v. Fellows, 42 Connecticut, 36, are in line with the case of Howard v. Veazie; but the Connecticut case is weakened by the dissent of two judges of the five composing the court?
A somewhat similar rule appears to prevail in Maine. Connor v. Lewis, 16 Me., 268; Johnson v. Pike, 35 Me., 291.
Other authorities, however, not cited by Mr. Jones, support a much more liberal construction of lien statutes. In the case of Coleman v. Goodnow et al., 36 Minnesota, 9, it was shown, that the plaintiff furnished the last of the material for the erection of a building, about the 16th day of December, 1880; the building was commenced in October, 1880, the defendants being in possession of the premises at the time; it was not shown that they had any contract to purchase, and when the contract was made the defendants had not acquired title to the land, but the same was owned by one Pease, who conveyed the same to the defendant Goodnow, November 23, 1880. In that case the mechanic’s lien was upheld; the court holding that the acquisition of title by Goodnow united in him the ownership of the house and lot, and that the lien rested upon his interest in both, and that he would not be permitted to defeat it by setting up title in a third person previous to that date. It is true, that the opinion does not disclose the terms of the statute then in foi;ce in that State, nor have we had access thereto. We infer, however, from the tenor of the opinion, that the statute in question required a contract with the owner. See also Hooker v. McGlone, 42 Conn., 95.
Mr. Phillips announces the true rule to be, that the person for whom the improvement is made will be estopped from denying that he is the owner of the land. Phil, on Mech. Liens, sec. 187. ,
In construing remedial statutes, regard should be had for the spirit as well as the letter of the law. In order to effect its object and attain the ends of justice, the statute in question should be liberally construed; but to avoid injustice to others, not its beneficiaries, it should also be fairly construed.
Applying this rule of construction in the case at bar, and bearing in mind the fact that before appellant filed his account, as required by the statute, to secure his lien, and pending performance of the contract by him, the other party to the contract, the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, acquired title to the premises, we hold, that as between them he has his lien on the property; and unless appellee Scudder is protected as an innocent purchaser or mortgagee, this lien is superior to his claim.
That the Constitution is to be considered in determining who are the beneficiaries under, and the extent and scope of the law securing such liens, see the opinion in Keating Implement and Machine Company v. Marshall Light and Power Company, 74 Texas, 605. In that case a very plausible construction of a provision of the statute was repudiated, because its adoption would restrict a right fixed and secured by the Constitution.
The rule of construction, applicable in many States of the Union, that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly' construed, probably had considerable influence in producing the line of decisions that place rigid interpretations upon statutes creating and securing mechanics’ and material men’s liens. Indeed, Mr. Jones, in section 1554 of his treatise on Liens, says: “ Mechanics’ liens are in derogation of the common law, depending for their existence wholly upon statutes; and therefore, upon the question whether a lien attaches at all, a strict construction is proper.” As before said, and for reasons given, this rule of construction has no application in this State.
4. Appellee Scudder, however, claims protection as a bona fide mortgagee and purchaser for value and without notice. This claim is founded upon these facts: November 15, 1887, Patterson & Scudder made a loan of $15,000 to the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, to secure which a trust deed was executed by said company on the property in question; at the time of making this loan, they caused the records of Bexar County to be examined, and found no evidence of appellant’s lien or claim on record, and Patterson admitted in his answer that the averments in Scudder’s answer, to the effect that the property had been sold under the deed of trust and purchased by him, Scudder, were true. As against appellant, the record contains no proof of such sale.
It was not charged in the answer, and there was no evidence tending to show, that the money was loaned or mortgage taken because of any concealment, misrepresentation, or other fraudulent conduct on the part of appellant. Appellant’s claim against the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company was founded upon a verbal contract, by the terms of which he was to furnish all the sheet iron, tin, galvanized iron, and other like material, as well as the necessary labor, to cover the sides and roof of a factory; and under article 3166, Sayles’ Civil Statutes, he was allowed four months after his demand became due to secure his lien by filing for record his verified account. His debt was not due until the company notified him of its insolvency and inability to complete the building, and directed him to quit work thereon; and he at once filed his account in compliance with the statute referred to.
It follows, therefore, that although appellant’s lien was not of record when the mortgage was taken, the fact of it not being recorded does not rest upon any negligence or fault of his. Under the existing conditions, it could not have been recorded sooner than it was—December 14, 1887.
This being the case, the doctrine of innocent purchaser founded upon noncompliance with registration statutes has no application; and it follows, no fraud being charged against appellant, that if his lien antedates the mortgage, it must be accorded priority.
It was held in Trammell v. Mount, 68 Texas, 215: “The lien of a mechanic, though not fixed before record of the contract or bill of particulars, when it is fixed, relates back to the time when the work was performed or material furnished, and hence takes precedence of all claims to the property improved which have been fastened upon it since that time.” In Keating Implement and Machine Company v. Marshall Light Company, supra, this doctrine was reaffirmed, and the broad proposition asserted, that within the period of time allowed by the statute for the lien to be fixed by being recorded, every person dealing with the property is charged with notice of the existence of the lien.
In our opinion, appellant’s lien existed at and from the time he begun performance of his contract, and no sufficient showing is made by the facts proved or alleged to postpone it to the mortgage under which Scudder claims.
The judgment of the District Court will therefore be reversed, and judgment rendered in this court for appellant against the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company for $1998.81, with interest at 8 per cent per annum from the 26th day of March, 1889, and establishing and foreclosing his mechanic’s lien as prayed for against all the defendants.
Reversed and rendered.
Delivered January 18, 1893."
216242,East Texas Fire Insurance Company v. James K. Clarke & Co.,1892-11-17,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
Action by Jas. K. Clarke & Co. against the East Texas Fire Insurance Company, to recover on a policy of insurance, written by the defendant, upon a saw mill situated in the State of Florida.
The defense is, that the policy was rendered void on account of the violation of the conditions thereof by the execution of a mortgage upon the insured property by Jas. It. Clarke, a member of the firm of Jas. It. Clarke & Co. . Trial was had by a jury, and verdict and judgment were for the plaintiffs.
This is the second appeal. On the first it was held that the mortgage was prohibited by the conditions of the policy. 79 Texas, 23.
The case now before us turns upon the question as to whether or not the mortgage which was executed by the plaintiff Jas. K. Clarke was ever delivered. .
It was shown by the-evidence, that on August 16, 1887, Jas. K. Clarke was indebted to the Southern Bank of the State of Georgia in a sum of money, for which he executed his promissory note, payable to said bank or order; and that on the same day, in order to secure his note, he executed a mortgage to the bank on land in Alabama, and the saw mill and machinery, situated on leased land in Florida, covered by the policy of insurance sued on. It was in usual form, purporting to be executed by Clarke alone, and contained no reference to his wife or her right of dower. It was properly acknowledged, and was delivered to Mr. Crane, the vice president of the bank, by the attorney of Clarke, and on August 29, 1887, the cashier of the bank sent it to Florida for record, and it was recorded there August 31, .1887. The property was destroyed by fire October 8, 1887.
On the trial in the court below evidence was admitted, over the objection of the defendant, to the effect, that when the mortgage was executed it was intended that Mrs. Clarke, the wife of the plaintiff, who executed the mortgage, should waive her dower interests in the property; that it was delivered to Mr. Crane, the vice president of the bank, with that understanding; and that plaintiff Jas. K. Clarke did not intend that the mortgage should become operative or effective until such dower rights had been waived, and so told Mr. Crane. A bill of exception was taken, and the action of the court in admitting the evidence has been assigned as error.
The mortgage is perfect on its face, and bears no evidence that Mrs. Clarke was to unite in its execution. Parol evidence was not admissible to prove that it was not to become operative as a deed until it should be completed by the waiver of dower interest by Mrs. Clarke. The mortgage was delivered to the bank by the attorney of Clarke; it was accepted by the bank and recorded. This is fatal to the contention that it was delivered as an escrow, only to become operative on the performance of a condition, “ for a deed can never be an escrow if delivered to the grantee himself, unless for the express purpose of being handed to another person, even though accompanied with an express condition, and not to take effect unless such condition is complied with.” 3 Waslib. Real Prop., 584. It was said by the Supreme Court of Georgia, in the case of Jordan v. Pollock, 14 Georgia, 154, in discussing the question, that a stubborn principle of law interfered and declared that a deed delivered to the grantee could not be an escrow: 1 ‘ One of those stern technical rules which the law, generalizing for the public good, establishes as controlling intention, and serving as lights and guides to the wayfarer in search of legal rights. That rule is, that a deed can never be delivered to the grantee himself as an escrow; but if intended to operate as such, must be delivered to a third person for him. If a deed be delivered to him, the law, for wise purposes and on just principles, vests the interests convej-ed instantly in him.” This rule is inflexible and unvarying. The exception stated by Mr. Washburn, “ unless for the express purpose of being-handed to another person,” is in fact no exception, for in that instance it is not a delivery, but the grantee is made the mere agent to deliver the deed to another person. Tiedeman, in his work on Real Property, also states the rule, and collates quite a number of authorities. Sec. 815. In Hargrave v. Melbourne (Alabama), 5 Southern Reporter, 285, it was contended that the wife of one of the grantors was to unite in the execution of the deed, which had been delivered to one of the grantees, and that the deed was not complete; but it was held that the delivery of a deed, complete on its face, to the grantee, is an absolute delivery, whatever conditions may be orally annexed .to qualify or postpone its operation, and it was not competent to prove by parol evidence that it was an escrow. The court erred in admitting the evidence as complained of. We think, moreover, that all the evidence before the court, including that which was erroneously admitted over the objections of these defendants, conclusively shows that the mortgage was executed and delivered; that it was a valid mortgage, and was binding upon the interest of Jas. K. Clarke in the property mortgaged, notwithstanding the fact that when it was delivered there was an understanding that Mrs. Clarke was to release her dower interest in the property, and that it was not complete without such release. There was no condition to be performed by the bank, and the delivery as to Clarke himself was absolute.
Delivered November 17, 1892.
We deem it unnecessary to inquire whether Mrs. Clarke had a dower interest in the property or not, as the mortgage was complete and absolute without the release. It is not necessary to notice the remaining assignments of error further than to say that Clarke should not have been permitted to testify as to what his intention was when the mortgage was delivered.
The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded."
216197,J. T. Hand v. A. J. Swann et al.,1892-11-17,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellant owned 8 acres of land in the southern part of the city of Tyler, 377-¡- feet in length north and south, and on May 5, 1871, he conveyed to John H. Rowland 1 acre in the southwest corner of said 8 acres, 281 feet east and west by 157 feet north and south, of which appellee Swann is now the owner by mesne conveyance from Rowland, having bought from Yarbrough and Wimberley, March 3, 1873.
On May 5, 1871, appellant conveyed to W. D. Burress 1 acre in the northwest corner of the 8 acres, 281 feet east and west by 157 feet north and south, of which the appellees 11. J. House and Edwina Duncan are now the owners by inheritance from their mother, Louisa L. House, who purchased from Burress on October 28, 1875. The width of the strip of land left by these deeds, between House on the north and Swann on the south, is 63] feet, which has never been conveyed by appellant to any one; east of and adjoining the two lots of 1 acre each, conveyed by appellant to Rowland and Burress respectively, there is a strip of land 59 feet east and west and extending 377] feet north and south through the block, which has never been sold by appellant to any one. Appellee Swann has enclosed an area 308 feet east and west by 176] feet north and south, which includes the 1 acre to which he has title, and extends 19] feet north on the 63] feet strip and extends 27 feet east on the 59 feet strip.
Appellees House and Duncan have possession of an area 308 feet east and west by 169] feet north and south, extending south 12 feet on the 63] feet strip and east 27 feet on the 59 feet strip, which is enclosed by fence.
This suit is an action of trespass to try title, brought by appellant January 23, 1890, to recover the strip of land thus held by appellees. The latter pleaded title by limitation of ten years, and on the trial the court decided in their favor on that plea. Appellant has brought the case here on appeal; and the sole question presented is whether or not such holding of the court below was correct.
It is conceded that appellees’ possession had lasted for a sufficient length of time to bar appellant’s title, if possessing the other requisites; and the question for our determination is whether or not such possession was adverse.
The evidence introduced by appellees was, that the land was enclosed, as shown above, at the date of the deeds from Yarbrough and Wimberley to Swann and from Burress to Mrs. House, respectively; that they bought with reference to the enclosures, supposing their deeds passed title to the area within the fences; and that they had held open, notorious, and visible possession ever since, claiming to the fences as their boundaries, and recognizing no other claim to the land embraced therein. In view of the findings of the court below, we must conclude that these are the true facts, notwithstanding some conflict in the evidence as to the time when the fences ""were placed as they now stand. Appellant never had any of the 8 acres enclosed.
The mesne conveyances under which appellees claim embrace only the land described in the deeds from appellant to Rowland and Burress.
In 1888 a survey of the premises was made, disclosing the fact that appellees had land enclosed which was not embraced in their deeds as above explained. Until that survey was made appellees did not know what area was enclosed within their fences, though Swann had paid taxes on an acre and a quarter. The following letter from Swann to appellant, of date December 27, 1888, was offered in evidence.
“ I find you are right about the strip of land in rear of myself and House, a part of which we have enclosed and paid taxes on for over fifteen years, thinking survey was all right until this survey. I have conferred with Reuben House, and am authorized to make this offer to quiet and clear titles of all cloud on his part and mine: We will pay you $100 net cash for the two strips of land which lie in the form of a T; we will have deed written at our costs by Dr. Wells, and will forward you for signing. Let me hear from you.”
Negotiations followed concerning the purchase by appellees of the land still owned by appellant, adjoining the lands of the former, but no agreement was arrived at.
Swann acted as appellant’s agent to render and pay taxes upon land other than that embraced in the enclosures from 1876 until 1883. He was not appellant’s agent with reference to the land in controversy, and did not recognize his title to it. In the summer of 1889, while the parties were negotiating for a settlement, appellant asked appellees if they intended to try to take his property from him by limitation, and Swann replied that he could not afford to plead the statute against appellant. House made no reply. The letter was written, and these conversations took place, in the effort to settle their differences, and in connection with the offer by appellees to purchase the land they had enclosed and that adjoining it.
We think this evidence is sufficient to show that appellees’ possession was adverse. The case differs from those where one extends his fence upon the land of an adjoining owner, intending only to assert a claim to the true line when ascertained. In such cases the possessor recognizes the title of his neighbor to the land defined by the true boundary, when that is ascertained, and hence his enclosure of a part of the land that does not belong to him is not hostile. Huckshorn v. Hartwig, 81 Mo., 648; Winn v. Abiles, 35 Kan., 85.
Here appellees bought with reference to the enclosures, and all the time claimed all the land embraced by them, and recognized no oth er right. The fact that they supposed they owned all the land enclosed does not render their claim any the less hostile, but rather strengthens it. The authorities cited all recognize the distinction. Alexander v. Wheeler, 69 Ala., 340. In the case last cited the rule is thus stated: “ If a partition fence be extended by one of two adjacent owners, so as to embrace within his enclosure a portion of his neighbor’s land, through mere inadvertence or ignorance of the location of the real line, or for the purpose of convenience, and with no intention to claim such extended area, but intending to claim adversely only to the real or true boundary line, wherever it may be, such possession would not be adverse or hostile to the true owner. There can be no adverse possession without a coincident intention to claim title. If the claim, in other words, is not up to the partition fence as extended, but only to the true line, there would be no adverse holding of the new enclosure, but only up to the true dividing line. But the rule is different where the fence is believed to be the true line, and the claim of ownership is up to the fence as located, even though the established division line is erroneous and the claim of title was the result of the mistake. In such case there is a clear intention to claim to the fence as the true line, and the possession does not originate in admitted possibility of mistake.” The Texas cases cited by appellant do not conflict with this. Tucker v. Smith, 68 Texas, 481; Bracken v. Jones, 63 Texas, 184; Blassingame v. Davis, 68 Texas, 598.
Delivered November 17, 1892.
The title had vested in appellees before their negotiation concerning a purchase. These were engaged in for the purpose of compromising differences and clearing the title, and under well recognized principles of law should not be allowed to prejudice the claim of either party.
The judgment was right, and it is affirmed.
Affirmed."
216284,E. L. Alford and Wife v. L. P. Alford,1892-11-17,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
This was an action of trespass to try title, brought by appellee, December 28, 1889, in the ordinary form, for tlxe recovery of 109 acres of land in the possession of appellants, who were made defendants, and for damages.
The appellants pleaded not guilty, and upon the trial there was a verdict and judgment for appellee for the land and $162.50 damages, from which this appeal is prosecuted. Appellee introduced in evidence the following deed from himself to appellants:
“ The State of Texas, Harrison County. — Know all men by these presents, that I, L. P. Alford, joined herein by his children, J. P. Alford, W. L. Alford, and II. C. Alford, for and in consideration of an agreement by E. L. Alford and wife Mollie Alford, during their life, and at their death to their heirs, this day executed and delivered to me, to care for and support me during my natural life and furnish me with the necessaries and comforts suitable to my age and physical condition, and with clothes to wear, the receipt of which said agreement is hereby acknowledged, have this day bargained and sold, and by these presents do hereby bargain, sell, release, and convey unto the said E. L. Alford and wife Mollie Alford, during their natural life, and at their death their heirs, the following described property:
-*• -*• $ -x-
“ To have and to hold the same, together with all and singular the rights, members, hereditaments, and appurtenances thereto belonging, unto them, the said E. L. Alford and Mollie Alford, their heirs and assigns forever: upon condition, that they shall faithfully comply with all and each of the stipulations in their said agreement to me, and before mentioned as the consideration of this instrument; that if said agreement is not so complied with, then this conveyance shall be void and of no force and effect; and a vendor’s lien is hereby expressly reserved on said land by L. P. Alford to secure the faithful performance of said agreement executed by E. L. Alford and wife, during their natural life, and at their death to their heirs, as the consideration hereof; and the right to live on and use said land during the term of his natural life is hereby expressly reserved. And at the death of him, the said L. P. Alford, if all of the provisions of said agreement have been complied with, said premises by this conveyance shall become their absolute property in fee simple.
“This November 2, 1888.”
Appellee then proved that at the time of the execution of this instrument there was a verbal undertaking on the part of appellants to do the things for which the deed stipulated as its consideration, and introduced evidence for the purpose of showing that they had failed to perform their part of the contract.
It was shown that appellants moved into the house on the premises mentioned in the deed, and lived there with appellee for about six months, when appellee left, appellants remaining in possession. Appellee testified: that he occupied his old room in the house, using his own furniture; that he ate at the same table with appellants; that the food and cooking were bad; that the coffee was not good and had grounds in it; that no clothes were given him, and that he had to pay for his own washing; that his bed was not properly cared for, and many vermin were allowed to get on it — so many that he could not use it for a month after he left; that on three or four occasions, the details of which he fully gave, appellant E. L. Alford, who was his son, cursed and abused him.
Appellee was 78 years of age, and his wife had died only a few days before the agreement was made between him and appellants. He complained to his daughter-in-law of the way in which his son was treating him, and she replied she could not help it.
The testimony of appellants denied these facts testified to by appellee, and there was other evidence offered on each side, making a conflict on the material points. It was shown that appellants offered to pay to ap-pellee $100 per year for 1889 and 1890, but the time when this was done does not appear.
Appellants offered to prove that they had made valuable and permanent improvements on the land; which was objected to by appellee, on the ground that no improvements had been pleaded; and the court sustained the objection. Appellants reserved exception.
It was shown that the land had been common property of appellee and his deceased wife and was their homestead, and that she left children surviving her, among whom was appellant E. L. Alford.
The motion for a new trial, assignment of errors, and briefs, present the points discussed in the opinion.
Under their first assignment of error appellants contend that appellee did not show such title as is sufficient to enable him to recover in an action of trespass to try title. Their position seems to be, that by the deed title to the land vested in them, and that it could not be recovered in such a suit, but that the remedj' upon a breach of the contract was a suit to rescind or cancel the deed.
There is some difficulty in determining the exact legal effect of that instrument. In consideration of the agreement of appellants to care for and support appellee during his natural life, and furnish Mm with the necessaries and comforts suitable to his age and physical condition, and with clothes to wear, it conveys, by its premises, the land to appellants during their natural lives and at their death to their heirs. It then provides, that they shall hold the property to themselves, their heirs, and assigns forever, upon condition that they shall comply with their agreement.
The deed then proceeds to reserve a vendor’s lien to secure the performance of appellants’ contract, with the right of appellee to live on and use the land during his natural life, and to provide that if at his death the contract shall have been performed by appellants the land shall become their property in absolute fee simple.
All of these provisions show that an estate upon condition was intended to be created; some of them indicating that the title was never to pass until there was a performance of the condition, and others that the estate was to take eifect at once, but subject to forfeiture by failure to perform the agreement.
It is not very material to the present inquiry to which class of conditions the one in question belongs. Whether it was precedent or subsequent, the failure of appellants to perform it defeated their right to the property.
Looking to the purpose of the conveyance, we think the intention was to vest in the grantees the present possession and enjoyment of the land, subject to the reserved right of the grantor to live on it also, and have such use of it as was consistent with the right conferred on the grantees, and was proper to enable them to care for, support, and maintain Mm there, as agreed upon; but that the title was never to pass unless at the death of the grantor the agreement had been fully performed.
This imposed upon appellants, at all times, the burden of doing the things required by the contract, and a failure at any time to do so worked a forfeiture of any right they may have acquired under the deed.
This would be the case also if the title vested subject to the condition to be thereafter fulfilled. Tied, on Real Prop., sec. 277. It follows from this, that in either view of the instrument, if appellants had broken their contract before the suit was brought, the title which appellee conveyed to them was determined, and Ms right to recover the property became perfect.
This virtually disposes of the second point made by appellants, that all the makers of the deed were necessary parties to the suit. All that was required of appellee was to show title to the property as against appellants. He had the title when he made the deed, for one-half of the land belonged to him absolutely, and he had the right to occupy all"" of'it dur-o ing his lifetime as his homestead. If, therefore, appellants’ rights under the deed were at an end, Ms title was complete. For this reason' also it was not necessary for Mm to demand possession or give notice to appellants before he brought suit. Tied, on Real. Prop., sec. 277.
There was no error in excluding evidence of improvements, because none were pleaded.
This brings us to a consideration of the sufficiency of the evidence to show a breach of the contract on the part of the appellants. On several points it is quite indefinite. In what respects and to what extent the food and drink were bad is not explained, nor whether or not the neglect of appellee was common or habitual. While there is evidence that no clothing was furnished him, and that he had to pay for his own washing, it is not shown that he needed more clothing than he had, nor that he ever asked that appellants either furnish it to him or pay his laundry bills-His evidence, however, does, if taken as true, show that he was subjected to indignities by his son, which may have rendered it unbearable for him, with proper self-respect, to continue to live with appellants. The contract contemplated that they should all live together at his old home, and that he should there receive the care and support for which he provided.
Delivered November 17, 1892.
Mistreatment of him by appellants, of such a character as to render his life there intolerable, would be as much a breach of their agreement as a failure to furnish him the necessaries of life. This evidence, together with the testimony as to the personal discomforts he was allowed to suffer while living with appellants, was sufficient to support the finding of the jury. The question was submitted to the jury by a charge which was fair to both sides, and we can not, consistently with settled rules, disturb their verdict.
Affirmed."
216183,Martha Storer and Husband v. W. H. Lane et al.,1892-11-17,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
Martha Storer, joined by her husband William Storer, brought this action in the District Court of Harrison County, August 1, 1889, against William H. Lane, Wade J. Lane, and Mrs. O. P. Gibbons and her husband C. R. Gibbons, as the heirs cf George Lane, deceased, to recover 2854 acres of land situated in Harrison County, being a part of the league and labor of land patented to Seth Sheldon as the assignee of Jose Arocha, by virtue of certificate 111 issued by Board Land Commissioners of Nacogdoches County.
Plaintiffs in their petition alleged sole heirship of the said Martha Storer to the said Seth Sheldon, and that she was entitled to the land in her separate right. The petition set out the proceedings of the Probate Court of Harrison County in the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased, by which the said George Lane became the purchaser of said certificate at administrator’s sale; averred that the said Lane was the attorney of the administrator of said estate, and became the purchaser of the certificate for a grossly inadequate price; that the proceedings under which said sale was had were void; and prayed for title and possessipn of the land as in trespass to try title, or that defendants be adjudged as trustees for the benefit of plaintiff Martha Storer; that the said administrator’s deed be set aside, and for writ of possession.
Appellees presented a general demurrer to the petition, and specially excepted, because:
1. There was a collateral attack on the judgments, orders, and decrees of the Probate Court of Harrison-County.
2. The cause of action was a stale demand.
3. No fraud was alleged against Lane in the purchase of the certificate.
4. There was no proffer to return the purchase money.
5. It did not appear that the County and District Courts of Harrison County, in which the proceedings in the estate of Seth Sheldon were had, did not have jurisdiction over said estate.
On March 21, 1891, defendants’ demurrers to the petition were heard, and the court overruled the exception as to stale demand, but sustained the general demurrer and special exceptions numbered 1, 3, 4, and 5; and the plaintiffs having declined to amend, the suit was dismissed. Both parties excepted to the rulings adverse to them. Plaintiffs alone have assigned error.
The petition alleges, that on January 1, 1889, the plaintiff Martha Storer, in her separate right, was seized and possessed in fee simple of the land, fully described in the petition by metes and bounds; that said land was situated in the county of Harrison, and was patented on the — day of May, 1882, to Seth Sheldon, assignee of Jose Arocha, by patent No. 605, volume 23, by virtue of headlight certificate No. Ill, issued to Seth Sheldon, assignee of Jose Arocha, by Board of Land Commissioners of Nacogdoches County, February 1, 1838. That defendants unlawfully entered thereon, ejecting plaintiffs, and held possession thereof. It was averred also, that defendants’ possession was not actual. That the plaintiff Martha Storer was married to William Storer on the 3rd day of April, 1862, and that since that date she had always been a married woman and a resident of Canada; that she was the only daughter and sole heir of Seth Sheldon, and was entitled to the land sued for in her separate right as the heir of said Sheldon. That defendants’ pretended claim to said land grew out of a sale thereof made in the administration of the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased; that they claim as the heirs of one George Lane, who was an attorney at law. That letters of administration were first taken out in the County Court of Harrison County on said estate, in the year 1846, by one Chatfield; that in 1856, one T. A. Harris became the administrator thereof, and so continued until the day of his death, July 25, 1873, since which time there had been no administration of said estate, and no necessity for any; nor has any necessity existed for such administration since January 30, 1860, when the said Harris-filed in said estate (after disposing of all the property that had then come into his hands, and no property afterwards came into his hands) an itemized account, duly sworn to, showing that a balance of $438.36 remained in his hands, after payments of all debts, claims, and expenses.
It was alleged further, that the said George Lane was the attorney for said estate from May, 1847, until November, 1871, and was cognizant of all the facts pleaded. That the said certificate had never been inventoried as the property of said estate, but on August 20, 1867, an application, sworn to, was filed for the sale of said certificate. Said application recited that the administrator was informed that his intestate had some claim to or interest in the said headlight certificate No. Ill; that he did not have, nor had he ever had, any papers showing what that interest was, or in any manner relating thereto; did not know the nature or extent of the interest; did not know where the certificate was, and had never seen it. He represented that all the debts of said estate had been fully paid off and discharged, except some that had been refused payment, and a portion of the expenses of administration which remained unpaid. That afterwards, on May 19, 1871, said Lane filed another application in said estate to sell said certificate; that- it referred to the application filed August 20, 1867, and made it a part thereof, and represented that the facts in said petition still existed; that an order of sale had been made, but no sale had ever been made thereunder; that the same cause existed for said sale, to-wit, the payment of a portion of the expenses of administration; and asked for a renewal of the previous order of sale; that no sufficient notice of said application for sale, or of the sale thereafter made, was given.
It was further alleged; that the District Court of Harrison County, which then had jurisdiction of probate matters, made an order July 1, 1871, on said application, directing a sale of said certificate; and that a sale thereof was made on the first Tuesday in August, 1871; that when said sale was made, the said certificate was not in the possession of said Harris, but the said Lane had learned by correspondence through an agent, and knew that it was on file in the General Land Office at Austin, and bid in said certificate at said sale, for himself, at the sum of $300; that a sworn report of said sale was returned by said administrator September 26, 1871, and without a continuance thereof for one term, as required by law, the sale was confirmed by the court November 20, 1871, and on December 4, 1871, said administrator executed a deed to said Lane for the said certificate, which said deed was never recorded until May 19, 1882. That all of the papers in connection with said sale are in the handwriting of said Lane, and he represented the administrator therein; that the price at which said certificate was bought was grossly inadequate; that it was worth the sum of 85000.
Plaintiffs averred, that by reason of the facts alleged the said sale was void, and that the title to said certificate never passed to the said Lane; .that said Lane died in 1885, and left the defendants as liis sole heirs, and that their claim is by inheritance from said Lane. That during bis life- • time the said Lane sold the remainder, to-wit, one-half, of said certificate, which was located on other lands, and was worth far more than the sum of 8300 pretended to have been paid by him for said certificate at said sale. That both said Lane and said Harris knew there was no necessity for the sale of said land, and that plaintiff Martha Storer was the heir.
That after sale, on April 22, 1872, said Lane wrote a letter of inquiry to the children or relatives of Seth Sheldon, deceased, and admitted the claim of plaintiff to property in the said estate; that after sale no other action whatever was taken in said estate, and at the time thereof said certificate was the only property that belonged thereto.
Plaintiffs prayed judgment as in trespass to try title, or that defendants be estopped from asserting any title to said land, or that defendants be constituted trustees for plaintiffs’ benefit, or that the title to said land be adjudged to be in plaintiffs and divested out of defendants; that any deed from the administrator to Lane be cancelled and held for naught; and that plaintiffs have the title and possession of said land, for writ of possession, costs, and such other and further relief as the case demanded.
As a collateral attack upon the orders, judgments, and decrees of the Probate Court of Harrison County, made in the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased, plaintiff Martha Storer could not maintain her suit. The recovery of the land in an action of trespass to try title would involve the nullity of the order of the court directing the sale of the land, and the decree of confirmation of the sale, and directing a deed to be executed by the administrator to the purchaser, Geo. W. Lane. At the time the application upon which the sale was ordered was made, the probate law of 1870 was in force, and it did not prescribe what the application should contain, as the law now in force does. Gillenwaters v. Scott, 62 Texas, 672.
If we treat the sale as one of personal property, being a land certificate, there was not even the necessity of obtaining an order of sale. 2 Pasch. Dig., arts. 5629-5635.
From the petition it appears that the administration of the estate had been pending for a number of years, and that a report filed by the administrator in 1860 showed a balance due the estate of 8438.36, after-payment of all the debts and expenses of administration; yet the application made for the sale of the land purported to be for the payment of the expenses of administration, and a purchaser need not look beyond the application and orders of qourt to ascertain whether or not the court had jurisdiction to make the order of sale. Property belonging to the estate may be sold for the payment of expenses of administration. If this was only an action of trespass to try title to recover the land sold in accordance with the application and orders in the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased, we should hold that it was a collateral attack on the proceedings of the Probate Court of Harrison County, and that the court below did not err in sustaining the defendant’s demurrer.
But it is also sought to set aside the deed executed by Harris as administrator of the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased, to Geo. W. Lane, the ancestor of the defendants, in pursuance of proceedings in said estate, which, if had as alleged, were fraudulent. While fraud is not alleged eo nomine, still facts are alleged which would constitute fraud; and such being the case, it is unnecessary to charge the fraud as a conclusion.
Plaintiffs alleged, that Lane was the attorney for the administrator of the estate; that in 1860 an account had been filed showing that the estate had been fully administered, and that there was a balance in the hands of the administrator; that in 1867 an application was made to sell the certificate to pay expenses of administration, which on its face discouraged bidders for the certificate by showing a want of knowledge as to its actual existence or ownership; that in 1871 this application was renewed and the certificate sold, while Lane in fact knew that the certificate was on file in the General Land Office, and was cognizant of all the facts with respect to the administration, and that no necessity existed for the sale of the certificate; that he bought the certificate at administrator’s sale for a grossly inadequate price, procured a confirmation of the sale, had a deed executed to himself, and afterwards, in 1882, procured a patent for the land; and not until then did he record his deed.
No other proceedings were had in the estate after the account filed in 1860, except to sell the land certificate; and the papers in connection therewith were alleged to be in the handwriting of Lane. The administrator died in 1873, since which time there had been no administration.
Unexplained, these allegations would show fraud on the part of the administrator and Lane in the proceedings resulting in the sale of the certificate. In McCampbell v. Durst, 73 Texas, 420, it was held, in a similar case, that it was a direct proceeding to vacate the deeds, which included the deed of the administrator of Burst’s estate, and that it might be done if the facts alleged were true, although the orders in probate stood.
Without determining, however, whether the facts in this case would authorize the setting aside of the deed, we are clearly of the opinion that they are sufficient to charge the defendants as trustees of the legal title for the benefit of the plaintiff Martha Storer. Martin v. Robinson, 67 Texas, 369-381; Fisher v. Wood, 65 Texas, 204. As shown by the authorities cited, this does not violate the principle that the proceedings of a court of competent jurisdiction may not be collaterally attacked, for the proceedings leading to the sale and investing the purchaser of the land with the legal title may stand, and yet the holder of the legal title inajr be constituted a trustee for the benefit of the equitable owner.
The facts alleged in the petition are sufficient to charge the defendants as trustees of the legal title for the benefit of plaintiff Martha Storer, and the defendant’s demurrer should have been overruled, unless it appears from the petition that the demand is stale.
The court below overruled the defendants’ exception setting up stale demand, and there is no cross-appeal; but if the judgment can be sustained on that ground we are not concluded from a consideration thereof, because the court below did not consider that it presented a defense, especially since under our practice this defense may be raised by a general demurrer, as seems to have been done in Smith v. Hampton, 13 Texas, 459.
At the time of the proceedings in the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased, which resulted in the sale of the land certificate, the plaintiff was, and continued to be up to the time of the institution of this suit, a married woman. She was married to her coplaintiff in 1862. Lane’s deed for the certificate was executed in December, 1871. It does not appear when the land was located, but it was patented in May, 1882, and the deed from the administrator to Lane was recorded in 1882.
Prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes in 1879, there was no law fixing a period of limitation to an action of this character; and when the defense of stale demand was invoked it was usual to apply the longest period of limitation by analogy to the statute, to determine when the demand would become stale. If it should be granted that there are no circumstances shown in the petition as an excuse why the plea of stale demand should not be invoked, and that equity would not follow the law in excepting a married woman from the application of the principle, yet less than ten years had elapsed when the Revised Statutes were put in force.
By the Revised Statutes the indefinite equitable defense of stale demand was eliminated from the body of our law, and instead of meeting such a plea now with excuses, it should be met with legal exceptions, as, for example, coverture or infancy. Article 3207 of the Revised Statutes is: “Every action other than for the recovery of real estate, for which no limitation is otherwise prescribed, shall be brought within four years next after the right to bring the same shall have accrued, and not afterward.” This article includes the plaintiffs’ cause of action.
Stale demand had not run against Mrs. Storer when this law took effect. It provided a"" law of limitation, instead of the equitable stale demand, which is met by the fact that the plaintiff Martha Storer is a married woman, and the statute was never set in operation against her.
Delivered November 17, 1892.
It was not necessary for the plaintiff to tender back the $300 purchase money bid by Lane for the land certificate, for the double reason that the purchase appeared to be fraudulent, and he had already disposed of and conveyed more of the land in value than the amount of the bid.
The court erred in sustaining the demurrers of the defendants, because the plaintiffs’ petition showed a good cause of action, and the judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded."
219056,"Heirs of Tomas de la Vega v. J. C. League, John W. Lapsley, et al.",1893-02-02,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
The conclusions of fact reached by the court from the evidence in this cause are: That in 1830 the government of Coahuila and Texas conceded to Jose Maria Aguirre, Raphael Aguirre, and Tomas de la Yega, residents of Coahuila, and Mexican citizens, each eleven leagues of land, the concessions being made under the-colonization law of 1825, and under the conditions prescribed by said act.
That in the year 1832 Stephen F. Austin purchased said three concessions from the said Jose Maria and Raphael Aguirre and the said Tomas de la Yega, and in accordance with the request of said Austin, they constituted Samuel May Williams, who was the secretary of Austin’s Colony at the time, their attorney in fact, to procure titles for said thirty-three leagues of land, and to take possession thereof, and to sell the same to such person or persons, and for such price or prices, and upon such terms as he, the said Williams, might determine.
That the power thus conferred upon said Williams is evidenced by a testimonio, executed on the 5th of May, A. D. 1832, in the city of Leona Vicario, in the State of Coahuila, by Juan Gonzales, regidor of the ayuentamiento of said city, and second alcalde of the same and its jurisdiction, owing to the sickness of the incumbent of said office, and acting by authority in the absence of a notary within said jurisdiction, with three instrumental witnesses and two assisting witnesses.
That said testimonio was proved for record in 1856, by the affidavit of Juan Seguin, made before the clerk of the County Court of Travis County, and the affidavit of James Hewitson, made before the clerk of the County Court of Galveston County, each affiant averring that he was acquainted with the handwriting of Juan Gonzales, whose signature was to the instrument purporting to be a power of attorney from Jose Maria Aguirre, Raphael Aguirre, and Tomas Yega, and executed on the 5tli of May, 1832, before said Gonzales, regidor of Leona Vicario; and that he believed the said signature to be that of said Gonzales; and further, that said affiant was acquainted with the handwriting of each of said persons whose names were signed to said instrument as assisting witnesses; and that said affiant believed the signature of each of said witnesses written upon said instrument was his genuine signature; and that said power of attorney was afterwards duly recorded in said year 1856, in the office of the county clerk for McLennan County, and also in the office of the clerk of the County Court for Falls County.
That said Juan Gonzales, in the following year, 1857, appeared before Peter Dowd, the then clerk of Starr County, and acknowledged that said instrument was executed before him, and that he signed the same, as recited therein, at the request of said Tomas Yega, Raphael Aguirre, and Jose Maria Aguirre, and by their authority and their direction, and in their presence, and that his signature to said paper is genuine, and that he signed the same as regidor of the corporation of the city of Saltillo, and second alcalde, in the year 1832, as expressed in said instrument; and that the signatures of Jose Nazo Ortiz and Jose N. Moval, signed to said instrument, are the genuine signatures of said witnesses, and that they signed same in his presence as assisting witnesses.
That said testimonio, shortly after the death of Stephen F. Austin, was, with other papers pertaining to his estate, deposited by the representative of said estate in the General Land Office of this State, and remained among the archives of that office from the time it was there placed by said representative until the year 1854, when it was withdrawn by Robert Hughes, counsel for the plaintiff John W. Lapsley, in the prosecution of suits for the ejectment of trespassers upon the said Vega grant. That the signatures of Gonzales and his assisting witnesses in the execution of said power of attorney were again .proved by the depositions of said Juan Seguin and of other witnesses, taken during the pendency of this suit and read upon the trial thereof.
That the said Samuel May Williams procured the title from the proper authority in Austin’s Colony for said eleven leagues grant to La Vega, and that the land was surveyed and Williams placed in possession thereof.
That said land was conveyed by Williams in 1840 to Mrs. Sophia St. John, for a valuable consideration, with the assent of said Austin; and that said purchaser from Williams conveyed the same in 1850 to John W. Lapsley, who held the title in trust for himself, Watrous, Price, Plattenberg, Goldsby, Frow, and League, parties to this suit. That the purchasers from and under Williams have held possession of the lands since 1849, and taxes have been paid by said purchasers upon the lands since 1846.
That La Vega never claimed or asserted title to the lands after the execution of said testimonio of 5th of May, 1832, until 1868, in which year he instituted two suits, one in chancery and one at law, in the Circuit Court of the United States at Austin, the object of which suits was to have said testimonio cancelled, and to recover from Lapsley and his co-defendants Watrous, League, and others, damages for the use and occupation of said lands purchased by them under said testimonio of said La Vega; and in each of these suits judgment was rendered adversely to said La Vega, and for said defendants.
That another suit, instituted and determined in said Circuit Court, between the mother and father of the McPhauls, intervenors in this suit, and the said Lapsley, involved the title of the Peter Flemming league, which was located on the La Vega grant several years after the La Vega title was extended, and the land appropriated thereunder by the said Samuel May Williams, and the said La Vega' intervened in that suit, and again brought in issue the validity of said testimonio or power of attorney; and said case was decided in favor of said Lapsley and against La Vega.
The conclusions of the court upon the law of the case are: That the title to the land in controversy was vested, by virtue of the testimonio of May 5, 1832, which was extended by the defendant La Vega before the said Juan Gonzales, as regidor and second alcalde of the city of Leona Vicario, and the subsequent mesne conveyances, in the said John W. Lapsley. That said testimonio is in due form, and is properly authenticated. That the same was admissible in evidence as an ancient instrument; and that the court did not err in admitting same in evidence over objections of appellants.
That the title of the McPhauls under the grant to their ancestor, Peter Flemming, to the land in controversy, was void as to all claiming and holding under the La Vega grant.
That the records in three following causes tried and determined in the Circuit Court of the United States at Austin, to-wit, number 37; chancery suit, and numbers 1093 and 1045, in each of which the said Lapsley and the said La Vega were parties, were properly admitted in evidence by the court, over the objections of appellants; nor did the court err in refusing to permit appellants to read in evidence, upon objection by appellees, the answer of Jose de la Vega, filed in said cause number 37, in reply to cross-bill filed therein by said Lapsley, a defendant in said suit.
And lastly, our conclusion is, that if error was committed upon the trial of this cause by the court in the admission of evidence or the rejection of evidence offered by appellants, such errors were immaterial as to the issue of title between appellants and appellees, inasmuch as no other judgment under the evidence could have been rendered than one denying the claim of La Vega’s heirs and those claiming under him by conveyances since the 5th of May, A. D. 1832, to the land in controversy, and decreeing the title to be in John W. Lapsley and his copurchasers under the said testimonio, and through mesne conveyances from said Williams.
This suit was instituted in the District Court of Galveston County, 1874, by Mrs. Esther Y. League and her children, heirs of Thomas M. League, against John W. Lapsley, the heirs of T. B. Goldsby, W. Plattenberg, J. T. Frow, the heirs of J. L. Price, Simon Mussina, N. B. Yard, George Butler, and Tomas de la Vega, and was consolidated with a suit then pending in said court, and instituted therein-in 1860 by John W. Lapsley against Thomas M. League and John C. Watrous, to recover on a note of said League and said Watrous, for $4533, executed on 9th of July, A. D. 1850.
The object of the consolidated suit was to recover the amount due upon the note executed by League and Watrous, and also certain moneys alleged to be due to John W. Lapsley and his attorney in fact, the said Thomas League, for services rendered and moneys expended by them on account of eleven leagues of land, situated in McLennan County and known as the La Vega grant, and for a partition of said grant between the parties entitled thereto, upon the payment bjr them of the moneys alleged to be due to said Lapsley and said League.
It was averred, that prior to the execution of said note by League and Watrous, said League had contracted for the purchase of said grant of land, and also for a large number of land certificates; and being unable to complete the purchase, the said Watrous induced the said Lapsley, Goldsby, Plattenbcrg, Frow, and Price to furnish the purchase money, and to become joint purchasers of said property with himself and the said Thomas M. League.
That Lapsley and his said four associates furnished the entire purchase money, the sum being $9064, and by agreement between all parties in interest the title to said grant of land and to the said land certificates was placed in the said Lapsley; and when the said note executed for $4532 by League and Watrous, the same being for one-half of the purchase money, should be paid by League and Watrous, and certain other moneys in said agreement mentioned and promised, Lapsley was to make a conveyance of one-half of all of said property to them, and the other half to be owned in equal shares by Lapsley and the said Goldsby, Plattenbcrg, Frow, and Price.
The petition alleged, that Watrous never paid any portion of said note, but that the note was paid by said League and his representatives, and thereby they, the heirs and representatives of League, acquired a lien on ■said lands for the money so advanced for said Watrous.
It was further alleged, that Watrous conveyed his interest in trust to W. B. Yard, to secure an indebtedness to George Butler, and that said interest had been also purchased at sheriff’s sale by one Moreland, through his attorney in fact, one E. J. Gurley, and that one Alexander, as attorney in fact for Moreland, had conveyed said interest of said Watrous to said Simon Mussina, and that Mussina had conveyed same to La Vega, but that the authority of Alexander to make such conveyance was denied by Moreland.
And the petition further averred, that the said Thomas J. Frow also asserted a claim, the character and nature of which was not known, to the interest of Watrous in said property.
The petition neither admitted nor denied the rights or claims of La Vega, Frow, Moreland, or Butler, but prayed that all parties be required to interplead and establish their interests, all of which it was averred to be subordinate to the rights of Lapsley.
In accordance with the prayers of the petitioner, Lapsley, La Vega, Mussina, Yard, Butler, Moreland, Plattenberg, Frow, and the heirs of Price and of Goldsby were made defendants. Watrous having died, his heirs became parties defendant, and denied the rights of the various claimants to the interest of the deceased in said property, and asserted title thereto, and also set up homestead claim.
Lapsley answered, alleging his expenses, services, and disbursements-in protecting title, for which he prayed compensation and reimbursement.
Goldsby’s heirs, and heirs of Price and of Plattenberg, and Frow, Butler, Yard, La Vega, and Mussina, all appeared and answered.
Mussina and La Vega answered, that they claimed the interest of Watrous through purchase from Moreland; that they purchased the same only to secure their peace under a title already existing and superior to-that of plaintiffs and their codefendants. They averred further, that they had been ejected from their lands by the said Lapsley and his associates, on January 1, 1873. And by amended answer, filed on the 7th of March, A. D. 1876, La Vega averred, that the alleged purchase and agreement of July 9, 1850, by and between the said Lapsley and his-said associates, Frow, Price, Plattenberg, Goldsby, and the said League and Watrous, was a fraudulent contrivance and combination, made and done to defraud defendant out of his said tract of land; and that they and others acting in complicity with them did wrongfully and fraudulently make use of and utter a certain false instrument in writing, purporting to be the testimonio of an act of defendant, for the purpose of' deraigning title to said eleven leagues of land granted to defendant -by the government of Texas and Coahuila; which said instrument, purporting to be a power of attorney to Sam May Williams, executed on the 5th of May, A. D. 1832, at Leona Vicario, now Saltillo, and empowering said Williams to take possession of and to sell said lands, defendant charged to be a forgery.
Subsequently, N. A. McPhaul, as next friend of his minor children, intervened in the suit, and claimed one-fourth of a league of land, part-of the La Vega grant of eleven leagues, by inheritance from Peter Flemming, to whom a league of land was granted in 1835, and which was located within the boundaries of the La Vega grant; and it was further claimed for said children, that they were owners of said one-fourth league by purchase through their deceased mother from La Vega. This claim was admitted by La Vega and Mussina, and pleas in reconvention were filed by La Vega and Mussina, who also claimed by purchase from La Vega a portion of the grant to La Vega.
Plaintiffs excepted to these pleas of reconvention, and pleaded in abatement thereto, and pleaded also res judicata. The exceptions were sustained, and also the plea in abatement; and upon motion of plaintiffs, defendants La Vega and Mussina were dismissed from the suit; and on trial of the case verdict and judgment were rendered for the parties claiming title from Sam Williams, under and by virtue of the testimonio of date May 5, 1832, empowering him, as the attorney in fact of La Vega, to sell the said eleven leagues. And Moreland, who claimed to be the owner of Watrous’ interest in the property, recovered nothing.
From this judgment an appeal was prosecuted to the Supreme Court, and that court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for another trial. 64 Texas, 205.
Upon the second trial in the court below, Mussina and the heirs of La Vega (he having died), and also the heirs of McPhaul, being parties defendant, and claiming title as in their pleadings filed before the first judgment, the jury found against Mussina and La Vega and McPhaul, and judgment was rendered against them, and the land decreed to be divided among those claiming under the purchase made by Lapsley in 1850, and Moreland was adjudged to be the owner of Watrous’ share of the property; and judgments for money were also rendered in favor of Lapsley and League, in accordance with their prayer, and the lands were charged with their debts; and there was also a moneyed judgment in favor of defendant Frow, which was declared to be a lien, subordinate, however, to the claims of Lapsley and League, upon Watrous’ interest. And the decree, after adjudging that the parties to whom the lands were adjudged should pay the judgments in favor of League and Lapsley, each in proportion to his share in said lands, further directed, that if these judgments were not paid within six months, execution might issue and be levied upon so much of the eleven leagues as should be necessary to satisfy the judgments.
Motion for new trial having been overruled, Mussina and the heirs of La Vega and the McPhauls excepted thereto in open court, on the 31st of March, A. D. 1888, and gave notice of appeal; and upon motion of the parties ten days were given by the court in which to prepare and file a statement of facts. And afterwards, to-wit, on the 31st of March, A. D. 1890, the defendant Mussina having died, the executor of his will, joined by the heirs of La Vega and by the McPhauls, sued out a writ of error, and by their counsel filed this transcript in the Supreme Court, and-errors; were assigned by plaintiffs in error, and also by the personal representative of the appellee Frow. But there is no brief filed in this court for any of the plaintiffs in error, nor is there an appearance for any one of them here.
The appellees, the heirs of Thomas M. League, appear by counsel, and suggesting delay, ask for an affirmance of the judgment.
We have not felt called upon, under these circumstances, to consider any of the plaintiffs’ assignments save such as refer to and question the correctness of the judgment in sustaining the title of Lapsley, Frow, Piice, Platlenberg, Goldsby, and Watrous and League as purchasers from the defendant La Vega, under his alleged power of attorney to Samuel M. Williams, as evidenced by the instrument purporting to have been executed on the 5th of May, A. D. 1832, in the city of Leona Vicario, in the State of Coahuila, Mexico.
Nor have we considered any of the errors assigned by the appellees, the representatives of Frow. We do not understand that an appellee or defendant in error is privileged to assign errors as against his codefendants or coappellees, as is attempted in this case. An appellee or defendant in error may assign as against the appellant or plaintiff in error, but he can not require a revision of any alleged error committed in adjudicating upon the rights of himself and his codefendants unless he appeals.
We have carefully examined the voluminous record of this case, and finding no error which in our opinion would authorize us to reverse or reform the judgment, it is affirmed.

216253,F. A. Weidemeyer et al. v. B. F. and W. Broyles,1892-11-17,"PER CURIAM.
The appellees in this case recovered a judgment against the appellants in the District Court of Anderson County, on the 23rd day of November, 1891, to which judgment the appellants, who were defendants in the court below, excepted and gave notice of appeal to the Supreme Court. On the 6th day of January, 1892, the defendants perfected their appeal by filing a proper appeal bond. The appeal was returnable to the Tyler Term of the Supreme Court, which would have commenced, as the law then stood, on the first Monday in October, 1892; and the appellants would have had until the first day of the assignment, during said term, to which Anderson County belonged in which to file the transcript in the Supreme Court. The transcript was not filed in the Supreme Court and has not been filed in this court.
On September 1, 1892, the law took effect establishing the Courts of Civil Appeals. Section 3 of an act to amend the law governing the practice in the District and County Courts, passed at the late special session of the Legislature, to conform it to the law establishing the Courts of Civil Appeals, approved April 13, 1892, provides: 11 That all appeals and writs of error taken and perfected from any District or County Court to the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals, before the taking effect of this act, shall be returnable to the Courts of Civil Appeals under the provisions of this act, and shall be decided under the same rules as if they had been so perfected after this law shall take effect.”
Delivered November 17, 1892.
Section 20 of the act creating the Courts of Civil Appeals reads: “In any appeal or writ of error as provided for in this act, the appellant or plaintiff in error shall file the transcript with the clerk of the Court of Civil Appeals within ninety days from the perfecting of the appeal or service of the writ of error; provided, for good cause shown, the court may permit the transcript to be thereafter filed upon such terms as it may prescribe.”
If the appellant should fail to file a transcript of the record as directed, then the appellee may have the judgment of the court below affirmed on certificate. Law Spec. Sess. Leg., 1892, 28.
In the absence of any specific provision of the law as to when the record shall be filed in cases in which the appeal has been perfected in the District or County Court for more than ninety days before the Courts of Civil Appeals were organized, we must look to the entire law on the subject, and determine, if we can, what the practice should be. To require the record to be filed within ninety days from the time when the appeal was perfected to the Supreme Court, would defeat the right of appeal, as that time had expired when the Courts of Civil Appeals were organized. We think that a reasonable construction of the law would be, that the appeal became perfected to this court on the day that the act establishing the Courts of Civil Appeals took effect, and that the appellants would have ninety days from that date, September 1, 1892, within which to file the transcript of the record in this court. As that time has not yet expired, the motion to affirm the judgment of the court below, on certificate, will be overruled.
Motion overruled."
216259,"S. W. Fordyce and A. H. Swanson, Receivers, v. Jeff D. Yarborough",1892-11-17,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellants’ first, second, and third assignments of error complain of errors in the charge of the court below. The portion pf the charge first complained of is, in substance, that if appellants were guilty of negligence in allowing the coupling apparatus of the car that caused appellee’s injury to become defective, and if appellee, without negligence on his own part, while coupling the car was caught between the cars and injured, defendants would be liable.
This charge was erroneous in not including in the enumeration of the facts essential to a recovery the further fact that the injury must have resulted from the defective condition of the coupling apparatus.
The same error occurs in the two paragraphs of the charge in which is defined the liability of the master for negligent failure to inform servants of extra hazards to arise from the use of a car of an unusual and more than ordinarily dangerous construction. In neither instruction is the fact that the failure on the part of the master to perform his duty in this respect must have proximately caused the hurt to appellee made one of the conditions of his liability.
It can not be said that the evidence so conclusively showed that appellee was hurt by a defect in the coupling appliances of the car, or as the result of a failure of appellants to warn him of the unusual danger incident to the act of coupling it, as to warrant the court in assuming these facts to be established. The instructions should have been so shaped as to leave it to the jury to find whether or not either or both of them were proven.
The charge in previous parts stated the case as one in which the plaintiff sought to recover for injuries received by reason of a “ defective car” ■and “ defective machinery,” and instructed, in substance, that if plaintiff’s injury was caused by a defective car, defendants would be liable, if the other facts essential to a recovery were shown; and it is claimed that this cured the errors in the subsequent and more specific directions. But the jury were not told here or elsewhere in the charge that appellants would not be liable if the defect did not proximately cause the injury, and the instructions complained of in effect charge them that liability would attach without proof of that fact. By the fifth special charge asked by appellants and refused by the court, the proposition that the alleged defect in the drawliead must have proximately caused the injury before liability could arise therefrom, was requested as the law of the ease.
As this rule was nowhere contained in the charge, it should have been given.
The nineteenth assignment of error is, that the court erred in instructing that “ if the defect in the car was latent and not known to plaintiff, and could not be known by the exercise of ordinary care, then the duty was on the master to acquaint him with the defect, if any exists.’ ’
The master would not be liable for an injury received by the servant from a latent defect in the car, unless by the exercise of proper care the master ought to have known of its existence. If he did know of its existence, or if he with proper care could have known it, his duty would be to remedy it rather than to warn the servant. He might escape liability by acquainting the servant with the fact, if the latter continued in the service and assumed the risk. But we can not see that this instruction had any proper application to the facts of the case.
There was testimony that the spring of the drawhead was defective, and that some portions of the castings about it were broken at a date subsequent to appellee’s injury. These are the only particulars in which the evidence tended to show defects which might in any sense be considered latent. If these defects existed at the time appellee was hurt, and the facts showed that appellants knew or with proper care ought to have known of them, their duty was, as before stated, to repair them; and their failure to inform appellee of these conditions could neither increase nor diminish their liability. It was claimed that the car was defectively constructed in its coupling attachments, and whether it was or not was properly left to the jury. But the imperfections which were claimed to exist other than those just mentioned were not latent defects.
The third special charge asked by appellants embraced several distinct propositions: First, that it was plaintiff’s duty to have acquainted himself with the general dp ties of the position. Second, that he assumed at his peril the dangers and risk naturally and usually incident to his employment, including the dangers and risk of such defects as were reasonably open to his ordinary inspection under the circumstances. Third, that if he knew that the drawhead was defective, or if the defects were open and visible, and failed to notify defendants of the danger of same, and without objection and protest continued in defendants’ service, he would be presumed to have assumed the .risk incident to the defects.
The court in its general charge gave sufficiently the substance of the first two rules. The effect of the third could be inferred, perhaps, from the language used in the general charge, and in another special instruction given at request of appellant. But the rule there laid down is nowhere pointedly given to the jury. If it had been embodied in a separate request it would have been proper for the court to give it. But in asking special charges parties ought' not to so connect propositions contained in the general charge with others not given as to make it necessary for the court to unduly repeat the same instruction. •
It can be easily perceived how such a practice would lead to serious irregularities, but if there were no other ground for reversal, we would not feel justified in holding this to be an error.
The fourth charge .requested should have been given. It stated correctly the law, and the several"" propositions it contains were not given in the charge with such distinctness as to render it unnecessary.
The fifth requested instruction, we have already seen, was improperly refused. Both propositions in it announced law directly applicable to the facts.
The sixth and thirteenth special charges were both properly refused. The sixth was, that appellee in accepting emplo3rment assumed to understand the service, and to be competent to discharge the duty of brakeman, unless the evidence shows that in the contract of emphtyment defendant assumed to instruct him with reference to his duty and the dangers incident to the service.
No question as to the duty of the master to instruct the servant as to his general"" duties was properly involved in the case. It was claimed, however, b3r appellee, that the car by which he was hurt was of an unusual make and caused extra danger to him in coupling it, and the duty of appellants to warn him of the danger to result from the use of such car was in question. Such an instruction as that requested might easity have been misapplied by the jury as controlling this issue.
The thirteenth requested instruction was based upon a rule of appellants, as follows: “ Great care must be used in coupling and uncoupling cars. Do not go between cars unless they are moving at a slow and safe speed, nor attempt to make any coupling unless the drawbars and other coupling appliances are known to be in good order.”
The special charge requested the court to charge the jury, that if plaintiff did not use great care in making the coupling, or went between the cars when the same were not going at a safe rate of speed, or attempted to make the coupling when the drawbars or other coupling appliances were not known by plaintiff to be in good order, plaintiff could not recover.
The court had charged in effect that appellee was bound to know the rules of appellants, and that if his injury resulted from his failure in this respect he could not recover, and that his inability to read would not exempt him from this duty.
There was evidence that appellee could not read well, and did not know of the rule in question.
It was the duty of appellants to furnish cars with reasonably safe coupling appliances in good order, so far as the exercise of ordinary care would enable them to do so. Appellee had the right to assume that this duty had been discharged, and that the couplings of the car were in proper order, until he knew, or by the exercise of ordinary care ought to have known, the contrary. It ivas not his duty to examine or inspect the attachments of the car, but this duty the law devolved upon the master, so far as its performance was involved in the care required of him. The effect of the instruction requested, if not of the charge actually given, was to reverse the positions of the master and servant in this respect.
Delivered November 17, 1892.
It imposed upon the servant a duty not warranted by law.
The first part of the rule contains cautions which it would doubtless be the duty of the servant to observe without a rule. But the latter portion, which requires the servant to know that the coupling appliances are in good order before going between the cars, should not be given as the law of the case.
The sixteenth assignment' brings into question the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict.
We can not say that there is not enough evidence in the case to sustain a verdict for appellee, though on several points it is quite debatable.
The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded."
219168,James A. Campbell v. S. E. Jones,1893-02-02,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
This suit was brought by the appellee,. S. E. Jones, in the County Court of Cherokee County, against the appellant, James A. Campbell, on a promissory note executed by Campbell, payable to Kirby & Jones, a firm of retail liquor dealers doing business in the town of Jacksonville, in said county.
Plaintiff claimed to be a holder of said note by indorsement before maturity, for value, and without notice of any defense thereto against the original payees.
Defendant admitted the execution of the note, but pleaded in bar thereof, that it was void because it was executed in consideration of intoxicating liquors sold to the defendant by the said Kirby & Jones, in violation of the conditions of the bond executed by them as licensed retail liquor dealers, that they would not sell any intoxicating liquor to an habitual drunkard, nor to any person after having received notice from the wife, mother, sister, or daughter not to sell such person intoxicating liquor.
In the charge the court defined the term ‘1 habitual drunkard” as de- . fined in Revised Statutes, article 2473, of the title on guardian and ward, as “ one whose mind has become so impaired by the use of intoxicating liquors or drugs that he is incapable of taking care of himself or property.” This was error. The definition in the statute relating to guardianship is for the purpose of determining when a guardian of the person and estate shall be appointed, and does not apply to the meaning of the term as used in the statute providing for the execution of a bond by persons obtaining license as retail liquor dealers. Sayles’ Ann. Stats., art. 3226a, sec. 4. It is here used in its common acceptation, and the capacity of the person to take care of himself or property is not in issue and is immaterial. The jury must determine from the common understanding of the term as to whether or not the person is an habitual drunkard. Trigg v. The State, 49 Texas, 676; Tatum v. The State, 63 Ala., 152; The State v. Pratt, 34 Vt., 394.
If the plaintiff, S. E. Jones, is a holder of the note in good faith for value, and received it in the usual course of business, he is unaffected by the fact that it was executed for an illegal consideration. 1 Dan. on Neg. Inst., sec. 197.
When the act out of which the consideration arises has been expressly prohibited by statute under a penalty, the defense has been held to apply to an innocent holder of the note, as in the case of usury. Our Supreme Court has held that a note given for usurious interest is void even in the hands of an innocent holder. Andrews v. Hoxie, 5 Texas, 171. But in this case there is no direct prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors to an habitual drunkard, or to a person after notice as provided by law; nor is there any declaration that a note given in consideration of such sales shall be void. 1 Dan. on Neg. Inst., secs. 197, 198, 199. The cases cited by appellant treat the instrument as void only as between the parties.
Monroe v. Smelly, 25 Texas, 586, was a suit on a note given for money won at a game called “ ten pins.” The note was given to Hale by Smelly and transferred to Monroe after maturity.
Seeligson v. Lewis & Williams, 65 Texas, 215, grew out of a “ cotton futures ” contract, denounced by the decision as contrary to public policy and-void. The suit was upon promissory notes executed by the defendant, who employed plaintiffs as brokers in the transaction, for money advanced by them in paying margins, and plaintiffs’ commissions. It was held that as between the parties the notes were void for want of consideration.
In Davis v. Sittig, 65 Texas, 497, it appeared that the note, though negotiable in form, was not transferred by endorsement, and was not in possession of the person to whom it was made payable; nor was it shown that the person to whom it was assigned before maturity ever paid value for it. So it was held that the plaintiff took the note subject to all defenses which the maker of it could urge against it.
By a cross-assignment of error the appellee calls in question the action of the court in overruling his demurrer to the defendant’s answer, setting up the illegality of the consideration for which the note was executed.
The purpose of the statute in requiring as a prerequisite to the license the execution of the bond with the condition prescribed, is clearly to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquors to habitual drunkards, and to any person whose wife, mother, sister, or daughter shall forbid the sale in the manner prescribed by the statute. Sayles’ Ann. Stats., art. 3226a, sec. 4. A sale, then, in violation of the condition of the bond as prescribed by law is a sale in violation of law. Notwithstanding the fact that the law prescribes a penalty for the breach of the condition of the bond, yet, we think, the evident purpose of the statute being to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquors to habitual drunkards and to persons after notice as prescribed, the consideration for such liquors would be illegal, because growing out of a transaction sought to be prohibited by law. Not only can the recovery of the penalty fixed by the statute be had, but the recovery of the consideration money by the seller may be defeated. The contract would be illegal and void as between the parties. Poll, on Con., 260; Wood’s Mast, and Serv., secs. 198-200; 1 Pars, on Con., 458.
The case of Campbell v. Segars, decided by the Supreme Court of Alabama (1 Southern Reporter, 714), was a suit on a note given for fertilizers sold in violation of the inspection law of the State, which fixed a penalty for its violation. The demurrer to the answer setting up the defense, that the contract was in violation of law and void, was overruled. This is a much stronger case; for here the sale itself is sought to be prohibited, while in the Alabama case the inspection of the guano was the purpose of the law.
There was no error in overruling plaintiff’s demurrer to the answer.
For the error in the charge of the court defining “habitual drunkard,” the judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.

216290,"Wells, Fargo & Co. v. T. J. Windham",1892-11-17,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
This suit was brought by appellee against appellant, an express company, in a Justice Court, to recover damages for injury to fruit trees, claimed by appellee to have resulted from negligent delay of appellant in delivering.
The case was tried in the Justice Court and appealed to the District Court, where a judgment was rendered in appellee’s favor, from which this appeal is taken.
The facts are as follows:
Appellee lived in Newton County, and had the trees shipped by express to Orange. He saw a notice in a newspaper published at Orange, of date December 20, 1888, and in another of December 27, 1888, that the trees were in appellant’s office there. On January 3,1889, he gave to one Nations the following order:
“B. B. Agent, Orange: ■
“ Dear Sir — Please deliver to the bearer any freight I may have in your possession, and oblige,
“Yours truly,
“T. J. Windham.”.
The bearer carried the note to Orange and handed it to one Brooks, who was the agent both of the railroad company and of appellant. Brooks read the order, and said there was nothing for Mr. Windham. Nothing further passed between them. Nations returned to Newton without the trees, and by the delay thus occasioned, the trees, when received by appellee, were damaged. It was shown that freight received by the railroad company and express matter received by appellant at Orange were kept in the same room. The trees were consigned to appellee in care of the railroad agent at Orange.
The only question raised in the briefs is, whether or not the order presented to Brooks, under the circumstances stated, was a sufficient demand for the trees in the hands of appellant to make it his duty to deliver them to Nations, and to charge appellant with liability for the damages resulting from his failure to do so.
There was nothing in the order itself to direct Brooks’ attention to matter held by him as agent of appellant, but its address to the railroad agent and the terms employed were rather calculated to mislead him than otherwise. Appellee knew that his goods were in the express office, but neither by the order nor by communication through his agent did he bring to the attention of the agent the fact that he was inquiring for express matter.
Delivered November 17, 1892.
To hold this sufficient would, it seems to us, defeat the purpose of the law in requiring a demand. Again, this order only authorized the railroad agent to deliver freight in his possession. How could he know, from the face of the paper, that Nations was authorized to receive matter in the possession of the express company. The fact that he was agent of both companies did not diminish his duties to each. Great care must be exercised by express companies to deliver goods to the right person, and heavy liabilities may result from a delivery to one not authorized to receive. A written authority from a ""consignee to a third person should not be so uncertain as to give just grounds for doubting the scope of the authorization.
Appellee contends, that the trees being consigned in care of the railroad agent, it was Brooks’ duty to transfer the possession to himself in his capacity of railroad agent, and then in the same capacity to deliver them to Nations. This assumes that such a demand was made upon him as to direct his attention to the trees and require him to act. This, we have seen, was not the case. It is to be borne in mind that the trees had been in the office for three weeks, and it would be unreasonable to expect an express agent to remember at all times and upon a moment’s notice the names of all consignees for whom he has goods. Besides, as railroad agent, Brooks owed no duty to appellee, and was not bound to receive the trees.
We must conclude that the failure of the agent to deliver the trees resulted from the fault of appellee and his agent; and the judgment of the District Court is reversed, and judgment will here be rendered in appellant’s favor.
Reversed and, rendered."
216181,"T. R. Bonner et al., Receivers, v. A. B. Bryant",1892-11-24,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellee sued appellants as receivers of the International & Great Northern Railroad Company, to recover damages for a personal injury, which appellee alleges was inflicted upon him through the negligence of a brakeman in their employment. Verdict and judgment were rendered in the lower court against appellants for $2500, from which they bring this appeal.
The facts, as we find them from the record, are, that appellee, while in the employment of one Burkitt, who had a contract with appellants to furnish them with wood for their road, and while engaged in loading-cars belonging to appellants with wood thus furnished by Burkitt, was requested by a brakeman in appellants’ service to assist in pushing two cars, then loaded, for the purpose of coupling them to the caboose, and was directed by such brakeman to get between two cars, which were coupled together, in order to move them more easily. He did so, and while he was pushing against the front car, while both cars were slowly moving, the brakeman mounted one of them, on which a brake was set, and, without notice or warning to appellant, unfixed the brake, whereby the cars were caused to move suddenly forward and caught appellant’s foot and ran over his leg and crushed it, necessitating amputation. Appellant, in thus pushing the car, was acting in furtherance of his master’s business, as well as that of appellants. He was between 17 and 18 years of age, had not been long engaged in that work, and it was reasonably safe for him to get between the cars and push as he did, if there had been proper care on the brakeman’s part; and we conclude that he was not guilty of negligence in acting as he did, but that, in unsetting the brake without notice or warning, the brakeman was guilty of negligence which caused the injury. Appellee was damaged to the amount found by the jury.
The evidence adduced in the trial below would, perhaps, have warranted the jury in finding that appellee was not acting in Burkitt’s interest when he was hurt, but in view of their finding we adopt the conclusion that he was..
The court charged the jury, in substance, that appellee was in Burkitt’s employment, and that it was not his duty to push the cars or assist in so doing unless such aid was reasonably necessary in expediting Burkitt’s business and in furtherance thereof; and that, if he pushed the cars only in response to the brakeman’s request, and as an accommodation to him, and not because it was necessary to the furtherance of Burkitt’s business, as an act reasonably incident to appellee’s'duties, then he would be a volunteer, and could not recover. But that if the brakeman requested or directed Bryant to assist in removing the cars in order to make up the train, and if Bryant did so as an act reasonably necessary in loading the train and moving the wood for Burkitt, and in furtherance of Burkitt’s business by facilitating the loading of the cars and making up the train, appellee could recover, if he was hurt through the negligence of the brakeman.
Another portion of the charge, which is assigned as error, is as follows: “ You will determine from the evidence for what purpose Bryant went to push the cars, and whether Bryant’s act in pushing the cars down to the caboose was or was not reasonably necessary under the terms of his employment, and considering the nature of his duties in the furtherance and expediting Burkitt’s business, or whether he acted as a volunteer and as an accommodation to the brakeman, and not under the belief that to push the ears was a part of his duties, and not for the purpose of expediting Burkitt’s business.
Under the facts stated appellee can not be treated as a fellow servant of the brakeman, and therefore precluded from recovering. Eason v. Railway, 65 Texas, 577; Bonner & Eddy v. Bryant, 79 Texas, 540. And as he was not himself guilty of negligence which contributed to his hurt, and as the brakeman’s negligence caused his injuries, the appellants are liable.
Delivered November 24, 1892.
The portion of the charge complained of improperly alluded to appellee’s belief as to whether or not it was a part of his duty to push the cars, for his right to recover would depend upon the facts to be found by the jury, and not upon his belief. The charge, however, does not instruct the jury that his belief on the subject would constitute the basis of appellants’ liability, and the jury would not have been warranted in so understanding it, in view of the previous and repeated specific directions, that his act must have been reasonably necessary in furthering or expediting his master’s interests. It would not be a fair construction of the charge to hold that it authorized a recovery upon appellee’s belief. Rather should it be interpreted to mean, if any effect whatever is to be given to such belief, that it must have existed in addition to the other facts defined as essentials to a verdict in appellee’s favor.
The charge fairly submitted the issues to the jury, and the evidence is sufficient to support it, and the judgment is therefore affirmed.
Affirmed."
219166,"Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. E. B. Wallace",1893-02-02,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
The holding of the county judge, that because the road of appellant was not fenced at the point where the animal was killed, it was liable without proof of negligence in such killing, was erroneous.
The evidence showed, that at that place appellant had established a flag station and siding where passengers were taken on and put off, and where freight was received and delivered by it, and where switching of trains was necessary for these purposes. It also appeared that across its main line and switch appellant kept up a crossing for a road, which had been in use there for ten or fifteen years, and that it was upon this crossing that the mare was struck.
In the case of Railway v. Cocke, 64 Texas, 154, it is said: 16 Under statutes the same as in force in this State it has been held, that the general terms used in such statutes imposing liability on railway companies for injuries done to animals unless their railways are fenced, do not apply to such places as public necessity or convenience require should be left unfenced, as the streets of a city or town, depots, and contiguous grounds, the crossings of highways, and other like places.” In Railway v. Dunham, 68 Texas, 232, the same principle is recognized and applied to depot grounds.
The language just quoted would embrace the ‘ ‘ depot and contiguous grounds” in this case and the switches upon which the animal was killed; and those decisions are conclusive of this case, unless this particular stopping place does not come within the principle, upon which they rest.
Some language used in those opinions, and also in cases decided by the Court of Appeals (2 Willson’s Civil Cases, sections 374, 670), is to the effect, that the exemption from the requirement to fence would exist only with respect to places where a fence would be unlawful. That language should be understood with reference to the facts which were under discussion, and to the point before the mind of the court, the exemption claimed being from a fencing of public streets of a town, which is forbidden by law. These decisions should not be construed to mean that no exception can be allowed from the statutory requirement to fence except in cases where a compliance would be a violation of positive law. The true principle, which is the result of the authorities, is stated in the extract above given from 64 Texas, and embraces within the exception all places which “ public necessity or convenience require should be left unfenced.”
Access to and from stations and the grounds around them necessary to their proper use and convenience must be allowed to passengers and freighters.
Article 4226, Revised Statutes, requires railway companies to receive and discharge freight and passengers at sidings and stopping places for receiving and discharging way passengers and freight.
Article 4239 provides, that “ when a company constructs a switch on its road for the accommodation of freighters, they shall be bound to furnish a sufficient number of cars for the transportation of freight therefrom when requested so to do.”
These provisions were made for the benefit of shippers and passengers, and full effect is not given to them if the carrier is required to fence them in, and thereby obstruct the public in the free enjoyment of the privileges thus sought to be secured. The mere fact that Quarry was a station at which trains stopped only when passengers or freight were to be received or discharged can not, in our opinion, take it out of the operation of the rule which relieves railways from the necessity of fencing their depot grounds. Those who got on or off the cars or shipped or received goods there were as much entitled to free access as were those dealing with appellant at its regular stations. The right to leave its track unfenced there was proper to the discharge of the duties resting upon the carrier.
This view of the case makes it unnecessary for us to determine whether or not the road which crossed appellant’s track was such as appellant was bound to leave open. The court erred in holding that appellant was liable had no negligence been shown.
The court held, that the killing of the mare was caused by negligence of the employes of appellant running the train. This finding is attacked as being unsupported by evidence. While the testimony tending to establish negligence is weak and of a negative character, and is contradicted by positive evidence, we can not say that the judgment is so entirely without evidence to support it as to justify this court in setting it aside. In such cases the rule is that the appellate court will affirm the judgment, whether the finding on the facts meets its approval or not.

Appellant amended his pleadings, and alleged that he had bought the land from Alfred Chesnut, from whom he received a deed, with covenants of general warranty of title, which were set out; and alleged that defendant was in possession, claiming title to the land by limitation of five years under a prior deed from said Chesnut and W. J. Townsend, and asked that Chesnut be cited and made party to the cause, and required to prosecute the suit and make good the title conveyed to appellant, and, in case title should be adjudged to be in Collins, that judgment be rendered in appellant’s favor for the purchase money and interest, the amount of which was stated. Chesnut answered, and demurred generally to this petition. At the trial, the court below sustained this general demurrer, discharged Chesnut from the suit, and rendered judgment against appellant for the cost of that proceeding.
After hearing the case on the facts, the court rendered judgment in favor of appellee Collins for the land, on his plea of limitation of three and five years.
The motion for a new trial, assignment of errors, and briefs, present the points discussed in the opinion.
The titles asserted by the parties were as follows:
Granad conveyed an undivided half-interest in the land to one Finley, Who, in 1859, conveyed to James Gibson. Gibson and Granad agreed on a partition by which Gibson was to take the south half. No actual line was established, but the land was in the shape of a rectangle, and it was only necessary in order to divide it in halves to run a line through 'the center east and west. On July 17, 1884, Gibson conveyed the southern half of the tract to Alfred Chesnut, from whom appellant derives his title by regular chain of transfers. . '
Appellee Collins entered upon the north half of the land about sixteen or eighteen years before the trial, supposing it to be vacant and intending to pre-empt it. Sometime afterward there was a transaction between him and Gibson, in which he claims to have bought all of Gibson’s interest in the 300 acres. Gibson claims that he only agreed not to interfere with appellee’s efforts to acquire title to the north half by pre-emption. Collins paid Gibson $20, and gave his note for $30, as the consideration of the agreement. No deed was made, and it was not shown that Collins has made any improvement on the faith of the agreement, and the note was never paid. On March 27, 1883, the heirs of William Granad, who was then dead, conveyed to Mary Duke “all their right, title, and interest in the 300 acres.”
Mary Duke, on the 25th day of May, 1883, conveyed the same to W J. Townsend and Alfred Chesnut.
The deed from Granad to Finley and that from Finley to Gibson were on record before the dates of these deeds, and all the parties had actual knowledge of them, and neither Duke nor Townsend and Chesnut claimed more than the north half, recognizing Gibson’s title to the other, as well as the partition agreed on.
On the 2nd day of June, 1883, Townsend and Chesnut executed to Collins a deed which described the land conveyed as follows:
‘‘All that certain tract or parcel of land situated in said county and State, located about eight miles southwesterly from Homer, it being the north half of a 300 acres survey in the name of T. P. Rhodes, it being the same that we purchased from Mary Duke by deed bearing date May 25, 1883; for a full and complete description of said land reference is made to the patent from the State of Texas to Wm. Granad, assignee of T. P. Rhodes, which is herewith delivered and made a part of this conveyance. It is understood that we convey all the rights, title, and interest that Mrs. Mary Duke had to the T. P. Rhodes 300 acres survey of land, but we only warrant the title to 150 acres of said survey, it being the north half, and the part on which T. F. Collins now resides.”
At the time this deed was made Collins had full knowledge of the title in Gibson. Townsend and Chesnut both testified that he recognized Gibson’s title, and that they all understood that only the north half was conveyed, but that Collins being fearful that Gibson, by reason of his title, papers calling for an undivided portion, would claim an interest in the north half, the deed, in order to quiet these apprehensions, was drawn so-that, in case Gibson interfered with Collins on the north half, the latter could claim an interest in the other part.
Collins testified, that he bought the entire 300 acres from Townsend and Chesnut, and that they told him they were selling him the entire tract, but would warrant the title only as to the north half. He further testified, that lie had paid taxes on the whole tract, and had claimed the whole tract, had cultivated, used, and enjoyed it ever since he went into possession. None of his improvements were on the south half. He does not deny the conversations testified to by Townsend and Chesnut, in which he seems to have recognized the Gibson title, and it does not appear that Gibson or any of his vendees ever learned that Collins was claiming the whole of the tract until it was ascertained that he was paying taxes on it. How long this was before the suit does not appear.
I. The sustaining of Chesnut’s general demurrer and adjudging against appellant the costs of bringing him into the suit was error. Appellant had the right to have his warrantor cited to come in and maintain the title and make good his warranty. The right of a plaintiff to do this has been denied by the Supreme Court of Tennessee, while it was admitted that a defendant could. Ferrell v. Alder, 8 Humph., 44. But in Vermont (Park v. Bates, 12 Vermont, 381; Petkin v. Leavitt, 13 Vermont, 379; Brown v. Taylor, 13 Vermont, 637) and in Georgia (Gregg v. Richardson, 25 Georgia, 570) the contrary rule has been established, and we can see no good ground upon which to dissent from the reasoning employed in those cases. Rawle on Cov., 220.
In White v. Williams, 13 Texas, 258, a plaintiff brought in his warrantor, as was here attempted, but the question as to his right to do so was not adjudicated.
In the Vermont and Georgia cases no effort was made by the plaintiffs in the ejectment suits to recover judgments over against the warrantors, as was here sought, but the object of citing them was to require them to prosecute the action brought by the warrantees to obtain possession, and to conclude them by the judgments to be rendered.
The provisions of our statutes (Revised Statutes, art. 4788) allowing warrantors to be brought in by defendants, in trespass to try title, does not change any rule of practice which may allow to the plaintiff the same remedy. Whether the plaintiff could, in this suit, recover judgment on the warranty or not (which is a question we need not, in view of the disposition to be made of the case, determine) he has the right to bring his warrantor in to maintain the title he had conveyed, or be concluded by the judgment, and it was error to sustain the general demurrer.
II. It is not pretended by appellee in his testimony that when he originally entered he had possession of or asserted claim to any part of the south half of the land, but he says he entered upon the north half with intent to pre-empt. If he had thus possessed himself of the southern part of the land, in the effort to acquire title by pre-emption, this, it seems, would not be a possession adverse to the true owner. Schleicher v. Gatlin, 20 S. W. Rep., 120.
If he afterwards bought from Gibson, as he claims, all the latter’s interest, by oral contract, he shows no facts sufficient to establish title under that agreement, either legal or equitable; and it can not be claimed that, so long as he held under that purchase, his possession was adverse to Gib.son. He consequently did not acquire title by limitation before he bought from Townsend and Chesnut.
That deed does not purport to convey a greater interest than had been passed by deed from the heirs of Granad. They held title only to the north half, and that is all the deed conveyed.
Under the peculiar language of the deed from Townsend and Chesnut to appellee, and its correspondence with and apparent recognition of the true condition of the title, it can not beheld that appellee’s possession of the north half should be extended by construction to the boundaries of the whole tract. That possession was entirely consistent with the claim of appellants to the south half, and the terms of the deed would not convey reasonable notice to them that appellee’s claim extended throughout the tract.
If the agreement between the former owners to divide the land be disregarded, that would not help appellee’s case; for then it could not be held that the deed from Townsend and Chesnut to him passed title to more than an undivided half-interest in the 300 acres. This would have made him a tenant in common with the owners of the other half, and no such facts are shown as would put in motion the statute of limitations against his cotenant. “The mere possession itself would be referred to that right which every tenant in common has to peaceably settle upon and enjoy the occupation of the common property, without ousting his co-tenant. Hence such occirpancy was not in itself sufficient to charge the appellants with notice that their interest in the land was disputed, and that the benefit of the statute of limitation would be claimed by their co-tenants, if suit were not brought within time to prevent the bar.” Moody v. Butler, 63 Texas, 213.
Delivered November 24, 1892.
The court below erred in holding that Collins had acquired title to the land sued for by limitation, and its judgment will be reversed and here-rendered for appellant, that he recover of appellee Collins the south half of the 300 acres tract, that is, the portion of said tract lying south of a line running east arid west through its center, and all costs of this suit, except the costs making Chesnut a party, which will be recovered by appellant of Chesnut.

219099,Isabella J. Davidson et al. v. M. M. Felder et al.,1893-02-09,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
This suit was instituted in the District Court of Washington County, by the appellants, on the 12th of August, A? D. 1889, to recover from the possession of appellees one-third of the lands described in the petition, and for the rents and profits of same; the petitioners averring that they were and had been for some years illegally and wrongfully deprived of the use and occupation of their lands by defendants. The land sued for was the inheritable share of their deceased father, Charles Gates, of two leagues of land, granted his father, William Gates, as a colonist.
The petitioners alleged, that their grandfather, William Gates, died, leaving surviving him their father, Charles Gates, and two other children as his only heirs, and that petitioners were the only heirs of their deceased father.
Defendants answered by demurrers, plea of not guilty, and pleas of statutes of limitations; and plaintiffs by supplemental petition averred the coverture of each of them from 1856 to the institution of their suit.
It was agreed that both plaintiffs and defendants claimed from William Gates, deceased, as a common source of title.
The plaintiffs proved that they were the heirs of their deceased father, Charles Gates, and that he was one of the children and heirs of William Gates, the grantee of the lands in controversy; that the lands of his estate had never been partitioned among his heirs, and that neither their father, Charles Gates, nor themselves had received any portion of the estate of William Gates; and they proved also that they were married to their present husbands in 1856. And it was further proved by plaintiffs, that neither themselves nor their mother had ever heard of any sale by their father of his interest in his father’s estate.
The defendants, in bar of plaintiffs’ right to recover, offered evidence to show that their father sold his interest in his father’s estate to his brother, Amos Gates, under whom the defendants deraign their titles. The grantee, William Gates, died in 1828, and defendants offered in evidence an agreement between counsel, by which either plaintiffs or defendants might offer in evidence any paper pertaining to the lands in controversy, without filing same or without giving notice that the paper would be offered; such paper, however, to be subject to any legal objection from the opposite party. Under this agreement the plaintiffs proposed to read in evidence what purported to be an instrument executed by plaintiffs’ father, and dated the 22d day of March, 1829, and which is in the following words:
“Article of agreement: Indented, made, concluded, and fully agreed upon this 6 th day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine, between Charles Gates of one part and Amos Gates of the other: Whereas, the said Amos Gates has paid unto the said Charles Gates two hundred dollars lawful money of the Mexican nation; now, therefore, and in consideration of the said sum of two hundred dollars paid, the said Charles Gates, for himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, doth by these presents covenant, promise, and agree to and with the said Amos Gates, or his assigns, to release, convey, confirm, and assure to the said Amos Gates and to his heirs forever, or to him he shall appoint or direct, all that tract and parcel of land containing one-half league on the west side of the Brazos, drawn.from government, and deeded to my father, together with all my intruse of the desests estate; and I do likewise appoint Samuel Gates, my oldest brother, to sign my name to the deed of transfer when the said Amos Gates shall think proper to have it done according to law.
1 ‘ In witness whereof, I set my hand and seal this day above riten, in the presents of the subscribed witnesses.
[Signed] Charles Gates [Seal].
“ Witness:
“ Eldridge Hopkins,
‘‘ Adam Lawrence.”
And upon which instrument was the following certificate from the clerk of the County Court of Burleson County:
“ State of Texas, County of Burleson.—Personally appeared before me, Jeremiah A. Hood, clerk of the County Court in and for the county and State aforesaid, Adam Lawrence, who, after being duly sworn, says that he saw Charles Gates sign the annexed instrument of writing for the purpose therein expressed, and that he signed the same as a witness.
‘1 Given under my hand and private seal, there being no seal of office, this 24th November, 1846.
[Signed] “Jeremiah A. Hood,
“Clerk C. C.B1.” .
And which paper was filed, as appeared by endorsement of the clerk of the County Court of Washington County, for record in that county on the 21st of December, 1846.
To the reading of this paper defendants objected upon various grounds, and among others, they urged the objection that the paper had not been filed three days before the trial, and notice given to plaintiffs’ counsel, but was offered as evidence under the agreement between counsel, and that the instrument was met by a plea of non est factum.
This objection was properly overruled, we think, by the court. By their agreement with defendants’ counsel, plaintiffs had relieved defendants from the burthen of proving the instrument. It was a recorded instrument, and even if the certificate of the officer before whom it purports to have been proved be not in accordance with the statute then in force, such certificates are now good by virtue of subsequent healing acts. The paper was properly admitted over this objection. The burthen was upon the plaintiffs to show the forgery, and they could not shift that burthen to defendants by a plea of non est factum, supported by affidavit. The other objection to the introduction of this evidence urged by plaintiffs we deem it not necessary to consider, as in view of all the facts we have determined to affirm the judgment.
In addition to this instrument, defendants offer in evidence a decree or judgment of the court of the alcalde of San Felipe de Austin, rendered on the 17th of February, 1834, adjudicating one-half of a league of the lands granted to William Gates to his son Amos Gates, and divesting the title of the other heirs of William Gates to said one-half league. To this decree the plaintiffs objected, because it showed upon its face that it was void; and this objection we also hold was properly overruled.
The defendants proved by several witnesses, that Amos Gates was in possession of the lands for several years before the death of plaintiffs’ father; that Charles Gates lived upon the lands of his father’s estate until he left the county; that he left the lands in the year 1832; that he died in about 1840; and that his widow and children returned to the county between his death and 1846, and lived upon the lands granted to his father, and in a house thereon owned by Amos Gates, and near to his residence, and were supported by him until they left the county between the years 1850 and 1853.
The evidence also showed that Amos Gates purchased the interest of his brother, Samuel Gates, in his father’s estate, and also the interest of his two sisters, Mrs. Kuykendall and Mrs. Cooper; that he was the administrator of his father’s estate, and that he was duly discharged from his trust by an order of court in May, 1830; that he claimed and exercised rights of ownership over both the leagues of land granted to his father until he sold and conveyed the lower league in 1857. There was also evidence that Charles Gates was heard to say repeatedly that he had sold all of his interest in his father’s estate to his brother Amos.
The plaintiffs put in evidence a power of attorney from Charles Gates to Samuel May Williams, dated in Nacogdoches, November, 1833, authorizing and empowering Williams to convey title to his entire interest in his father’s estate to his brother Amos Gates. There was no evidence of any assertion or claim of title to the lands in controversy by plaintiffs until the institution of this suit. These facts, considered in connection with the further fact that in the lifetime of Charles Gates a paroi sale of land was valid, the court holds to be sufficient to establish a sale by Charles Gates of his interest in his father’s estate to his brother, Amos Gates, and that the judgment of the court should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.

216210,The J. B. Watkins Land and Mortgage Company v. W. W. Howeth et al.,1892-11-01,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This appeal is from a judgment rendered in the District Court of Cooke County on the 17th day of May, 1889, against appellant, in a suit upon a promissory note. The record presents for determination a single, though somewhat novel, question.
On the 26tli day of August, 1887, E. F. Bunch and wife conveyed to appellee W. W. Howeth a certain lot of land situated in the town of Gainesville, Cooke County, for which Howeth executed his negotiable promissory note, to the order of E. F. Bunch, in the sum of $400, payable on or before September 1, 1888; and to secure its payment a vendor’s lien was retained on the land conveyed. Sometime prior to the 7th day of October, 1887, said Bunch proposed to appellant to sell it the note, to which proposition appellant replied that he and the maker of the note must make an affidavit in respect thereto, as required by said company in the purchase of such notes, and furnished Bunch a blank form for that purpose. At the request of Bunch appellant Howeth joined him in making said affidavit, upon being informed by Bunch that he desired to negotiate the note, and that the affidavit was required for that purpose. The affidavit was made, bearing date the 7th day of October, 1887, and began as follows:
“ State of Texas, County of CooJee. — I, W. W. Howeth, maker, and E. F. Bunch, payee, do solemnly swear, each for himself, that said payee is the legal owner and holder of a certain vendor’s lien note, dated August 26, 1887, bearing interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, and signed by said maker.”
Then follow a great many minute statements with reference to the note and the land which secured its payment, referring to the book and page where the deed was recorded, setting forth the absence of all other liens and the priority of the lien in question, the solvency of the maker, giving a detailed statement of the property owned by him subject to execution, the facts about his homestead, and such like statements bearing upon the validity of the lien as security and upon the solvency of the maker of the note; which statements constituted the bulk of said affidavit.
Prior to the making of this affidavit Bunch had sold and did not then own the note which had been executed by Howeth, which facts were concealed by Bunch from both appellant and appellee (the note not being produced at the time of the making of said affidavit). Howeth testified, that he believed at the time that Bunch owned the note executed by him, and had no reason to doubt or suspect that he had already negotiated it; and that he signed the same without hesitation, there being no note exhibited to him, and that the note which he had in his mind and referred to in the statement was the genuine note which he had executed; and that at the maturity of that note, it and the note sued on were presented to him for payment, the one sued on being a forgery and literal copy of the genuine note. He consequently pleaded non est factum to the note sued upon, but paid the genuine note.
M. J.. Dart, the manager of appellant company in Texas, testified, that on the 8th of October, 1887, Bunch called a second time at the office of said company in Dallas and offered the note sued on for sale, accompanied by the affidavit above mentioned, and thereupon he bought the note for said company and paid him therefor its face value, and that he was induced to make such purchase on the statements and representations made therein by Howeth, and that he would not have bought the note and parted with the money paid therefor if Howeth had not made said statements; that he relied on the affidavit implicitly and was deceived thereby, and that he knew Howeth to be a truthful and solvent man. He also testified that it was the universal custom of his company to require statements similar to the one given by Bunch from every person offering to sell it vendors’ lien notes. Appellant therefore pleaded an estoppel against Howeth, which was adjudged insufficient by the trial court. It was shown on the trial that Bunch was insolvent and had fled the country, the note being indorsed in blank by him. It also appeared that the statements in the affidavit were all true except the introductory statement quoted above.
Among other requisites of an estoppel, it is laid down by Mr. Pomeroy (2 Pomeroy’s Equity, section 805): “ (1) There must be conduct — acts, language, or silence — amounting to a representation or a concealment of material facts. (2) These facts must be known to the party estopped at the time of his said conduct, or at least the circumstances must be such that knowledge of them is necessarily imputed to him. * * * (4) The conduct must be done with the intention, or at least with the expectation, that it will be acted upon by the other party, or under such circumstances that it is both natural and probable that it will be so acted upon.”
Delivered November 1, 1892.
The fraud perpetrated on appellant was accomplished by means of a forged note.
It is true the agent of appellant testified that he was deceived bj' the affidavit,, but in the absence of the forged note there could have been no deception. It was wholly immaterial whether Bunch owned the genuine note at the time or not, as that note was not the one assigned to appellant. He could just as easily have perpetrated the fraud while still owning the genuine note, and negotiated it afterwards. The form of the affidavit furnished by appellant did not direct attention to the question of the genuineness of the note: but the purport of its contents naturally led the mind of the maker of the note to other matters of inquiry. The statement as to the ownership of a certain note described in a certain deed on record was merely an introductory matter to the more important inquiries as to the condition of the title to the property which secured the note, and as to the solvency of the maker of the note. It is clear that the maker of the note was innocent of aiy7 intentional wrong, and that his statement in respect to the ownership of the genuine note was not made under circumstances which required him to know that a forged note was the subject of his affidavit. • The note mentioned in the affidavit was not identified in any way except by description of the genuine note. If appellant desired to guard against forgery, it should have required an affidavit from the maker as to the genuineness of the particular note offered for sale, by having it submitted to the maker and identified by mark or otherwise as the note in reference to which the statements in the affidavit were made.
Our conclusion is, that the representation in the affidavit as to the ownership of the genuine note, which was the only false statement therein, was not material under the facts of this case; and that if said representation be deemed an assertion, not only of title to the genuine note, but of its identity with the forged note, which would be material, this fact was unknown to Howeth, and the circumstances were not such as to impute knowledge to him; and that it was not made with the intention or expectation that it would be acted upon in so far as this identity between the genuine and spurious note was asserted, and that under the circumstances it was neither natural nor probable that it would be so acted upon; in other words, that the fraud of Bunch in substituting a forged note, and in using the affidavit as a means of negotiating the forged note, was unforeseen and unexpected, and both unnatural and improbable.
We therefore hold that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and it is accordingly so ordered.
Affirmed."
219218,Texas & New Orleans Railway Company v. Jane Bingham,1893-02-09,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellee was a passenger upon one of the appellant’s trains from Beaumont to Liberty. When the latter place was reached the train did not come to a stop, but slackened its •speed so that two male passengers safely alighted in appellee’s presence. Appellee, when the name of the station was announced, had gone upon the platform of the car, and was standing there waiting for the cars to stop. Seeing that they were not stopping, she asked an employe of appellant, whom she supposed to be the conductor, if she should jump off. He directed her to wait until the train got opposite the depot. The train ■continued to move on, increasing its speed, and finally appellant’s servant told her she would have to jump off, which she did, receiving the injuries for which she seeks compensation in this suit.
There is a conflict of evidence upon all of the material facts just stated, but the issues having been submitted to a jury by a charge of which no complaint is made, and the jury having found in appellee’s favor, we must conclude that all the facts testified to by witnesses which are necessary to sustain the verdict are established. In view of these facts, we conclude that appellant was guilty of negligence in not stopping its train at the station, and that appellee was not, under the circumstances testified to by her and her witnesses, guilty of negligence in trying to alight, so as to preclude her from recovering.
We therefore conclude as matter of law, that appellant is liable in damages for this breach of its contract of carriage. The amount found by the jury is not claimed to be excessive, and is warranted by the evidence.
The point made in appellant’s fifth assignment of error, that the evidence fails to show that the train on which she was a passenger, and the servants of whose negligence she complains, were those of appellant, was not raised in the motion for a new trial in the court below, and can not therefore be considered here.

219209,Martha Gregory v. Southern Pacific Railway Company,1893-02-09,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Suit by appellant to recover damages for the alleged negligent killing of her son, Jack Goolsby, by appellee. The cause was tried by the judge, a jury having been waived, and judgment, upon conclusions of law and fact, was rendered for appellee.
There is no assignment of errors in the record, and unless there is fundamental error apparent the judgment must be affirmed.
The findings of fact by the court below are sustained by the evidence, and, briefly stated, are as follows: Deceased was lying asleep on appellee’srailway track, and was run over and killed by one of its trains. Appellee’s servants discovered him as soon as they could do so with reasonable care, and used all proper diligence to stop the train, but were so close to him that they could not do so until the cars had passed over his body. The conclusion of law, that appellee was not liable, resulted necessarily from these facts.
Appellant sought a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. It seems that one Simmons had misled appellant’s attorney by statements, made before announcement for trial, which tended to show that the servants operating the train could have stopped it after discoving the body upon the track, and thus avoided injury to the deceased, and that they were guilty of negligence in not doing so; and that the witness on the stand testified to a different state of facts, admitting at the same time that he had made the statements imputed to him.
Without going into all the facts shown in the motion and the accompanying affidavits, it will suffice to say that appellant, when she discovered during the trial that the witness had deceived her attorney, should have applied for leave to withdraw her announcement, and to continue the case. Having proceeded with the trial and taken the chances of a judgment, she-ought not to be allowed to complain. Besides, we can not see from' the showing made that appellant was justified in relying so implicitly on one witness, when the facts were disputed, and when those shown by the affidavits made in connection with the motion for new trial were of a character to have been easily proven, if true.
There being no error apparent, the judgment is affirmed.

H. S. Holman was justice of the peace of Precinct No. 1, Cooke County. In his court this suit was instituted by appellants as plaintiffs against appellee as defendant. Judgment was rendered for appellee, from which appellants appealed to the County Court of Cooke County. Pending the appeal Holman was elected county judge of Cooke County. When the cause was called for trial in the County Court, Holman, the county judge, declined to take jurisdiction thereof. He held that he was disqualified to try the case, from the fact that he had tried it as justice of the peace, and for this reason transferred it to the District Court of Cooke County. A trial in the District Court resulted in a judgment for appellee, from which appellants appeal.
It is urged that the District Court was without jurisdiction to try the case, the County Court having erred in the transfer referred to, and that this appeal should be dismissed.
We hold that the fact that the county judge had presided at the trial in the Justice Court did not disqualify him from hearing the case in the County Court, and did not justify its transfer to the District Court. Rev. Stats., art. 1138; Railway v. Holden, 3 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 323.
It remains for us, therefore, but to dismiss this appeal, with instructions to the District Court to transfer the cause to the County Court, and it is so ordered.

216267,F. A. Rubrecht et al. v. W. H. Powers,1892-11-01,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On May 19, 1888, appellant F. A. Rubrecht executed to Moses Powers his two notes for $393.50 each, the first one due November 15, after date, and the other due May 15, 1889, after date, and stipulating that it “becomes due November 15, 1888, if note executed even date therewith is not paid at maturity. ’ ’ These notes were secured by a deed in trust given by said Rubrecht to R. Sarlls, trustee, upon the 160 acres of land in controversy. These notes not being paid when the first one matured, the land was sold under said deed of trust on the 22nd day of December, 1888, and appellee became the purchaser at this sale for the sum of $285, and on the 24th day of December, 1888, filed his petition in trespass to try title against said F. A. Rubrecht, claiming the land in controversy under his purchase at said sale. Appellant filed a plea of not guilty, and pleaded specially, that the land was his homestead at the time of the execution of said deed of trust and the sales thereunder; also, that prior to the execution of said two notes the said Moses Powers had sold the land in controversy, with another tract of 153 acres out of the AY. A. J. Finch survey, under execution, and then had suits pending for the recovery of said land, and said notes were executed to compromise this litigation, under an agreement that said Powers would convey back to appellant said two tracts of land, which he had failed and refused to do, and had placed it out of his power to reconvey the Finch tract by conveying it to other parties. Upon the trial of the case a written instrument under which said compromise was made was introduced, as follows:
“ It is agreed and understood by and between Moses Powers and F. A. Rubrecht that they settle the suits now pending between them upon the following basis: The said Powers is to allow said Rubrecht $1000 credit upon the notes or judgments held by said Powers for the land sold to said Rubrecht by Powers for which said notes were given, and that said Rubrecht is to pay all costs accrued in said cases for sales of lands, and all other costs of whatever kind connected with said cases, together with $200 attorney fees paid by said Powers in said cases. The said amount is to be summed up by said Powers, and the said Rubrecht is to execute a good and sufficient note for the balance due, payable in six and twelve months, at 10 per cent interest, secured on 160 acres of land twelve miles east of Gainesville, known as the Elizabeth Spencer survey. AVhen this note is executed and delivered to said Powers, said suits are to be dismissed, provided entered into and signed up by the 18th of May, 1888. Said Rubrecht is to insure the house on the land in favor of said Powers.

AYithout objection, however, on the trial verbal evidence was introduced by appellant which tended to show the agreement for the reconveyance of said land to be as alleged by him, but there is no allegation in the pleading giving any reason why this part of the contract was left out of the written agreement.
Mrs. Caroline Rubrecht, wife of appellant F. A. Rubrecht, intervened, alleging substantially the same facts set forth in the answer of her husband. The appellee, in reply to appellant’s answer, alleged abandonment of the land in controversy by appellant as his homestead; and further, 11 that Moses Powers purchased the 153 acres of land mentioned in said answer at execution sale, but the defendant claimed that plaintiff acquired no title by such purchase, and that the land belonged to George Baker and others, and the said defendant executed a deed to said Baker and others, vesting all his title in said parties.”
The court below charged fully upon the question of homestead, and also, in effect, that if it was a part of the agreement that Moses Powers should reconvey to Rubrecht the 153 acres out of the Finch survey, and had failed to do this, and plaintiff had notice of this at the time of his purchase, he could not recover, unless the jury further believed that said Powers had no title to said 153 acres, and the said Rubrecht knew he had no title to the same; then the failure of said Powers to make said deed could not avail as a defense. The verdict was in favor of appellee upon all the issues, and judgment was rendered accordingly, from which appellants prosecute this appeal.
No question is made as to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict upon the issue of homestead. No evidence was offered to show that appellant Rubrecht had conveyed the land to Baker as alleged by appellee, and the undisputed evidence showed that the 153 acres was purchased with the separate property of a former wife of Rubrecht, who had died leaving children.
When this case was called for trial appellant presented a written application for a continuance on account of the absence of two witnesses, which in form was in compliance with the statute; but the court, instead of then acting on this application, gave appellee until the next morning to procure the attendance of the witnesses named therein, and appellant in his first assignment complains of this action of the court. Appellant shows no injury resulting to him from the course adopted, and we are disposed to commend rather than condemn this practice.
Upon the appearance of tlie witnesses named in his first application for continuance, appellant made another application to postpone the trial on account of the absence of other alleged material witnesses, to obtain whose attendance he had used no diligence. He does not state in his application what he expects to prove by these witnesses, nor does he in a motion for a new trial show that he suffered any injury, from their nonattendance. The application not showing diligence under the statute, was to a great extent addressed to the discretion of the court, and we see no abuse of this discretion. Chilson v. Reeves, 29 Texas, 275.
In his third assignment appellant complains of the action of the court in calling this case for trial ahead of some nonjury cases, which he contends should have been first tried; but we think the action of the court was entirely proper. Railway v. Shuford, 72 Texas, 165; Allyn v. Willis, 65 Texas, 70.
Delivered November 1, 1892.
Appellants’ remaining assignments relate to the action of the court in admitting in evidence the written agreement copied in the conclusions of fact set forth above, and in giving and refusing charges upon the issue raised by the parol evidence, admitted without objection, as to whether or not it was a part of the contract of settlement between Moses Powers and appellant that the former should reconvey to the latter the 153 acres out of the Finch survey.
We are of opinion that the court not only did not err in admitting this contract in evidence, but that after its admission, under the pleadings in this case, it became the only evidence of the terms of settlement between the parties, and any charges upon the issue raised by the parol evidence became unnecessary. The contract upon its face purports to set forth the terms of settlement between the parties, and that this can not be contradicted, added to, or varied by parol evidence, without allegations and evidence of fraud, accident, or mistake, is well settled. Lanius v. Shuber, 77 Texas, 27; Belcher v. Mulhall, 57 Texas, 17; Heirs of Watrous v. Mc-Kie, 54 Texas, 71; Wooters v. Railway, 54 Texas, 297; Milliken v. Callahan County, 69 Texas, 206; Self v. King, 28 Texas, 552.
This case can not be classed with that line of cases where the contract consists of distinct parts, and it is attempted to reduce a part only of such contract to writing. In such cases it is well settled that parol evidence may be received to prove the parts of the contract not embraced in the writing. Thomas v. Hammond, 47 Texas, 43; Railway v. Jones, 82 Texas, 161. In this case the writing upon its face appears to embrace the whole terms of settlement between the parties, and there are no allegations in the pleadings of appellant attempting to give a reason why that part of the alleged verbal contract binding Powers to reconvey the 153 acres was not included therein; nor do we find any evidence in the record justifying the contention of appellant that after its execution a new verbal one was made in its stead. Under these circumstances the writing must be held to embrace all the contract between the parties, and any errors the court may have committed in its charge upon the issues raised by the verbal' evidence must be held to have been immaterial.
Upon the whole case, we are of opinion the judgment rendered by the court below should be in all things affirmed, and it is so ordered.

219258,Daniel Dempsey v. R. K. McKennell,1893-02-09,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
The judgment in this cause was affirmed by the Court of Appeals at its last term at this place, and on motion of appellant a new hearing was granted, and the cause comes to this court for disposition.
There are two questions presented, viz.: First. Is the amount sued for and recovered below due as current wages for personal services ? Second. If it is, can it be offset by a debt due to appellant from appellee, which is in no way connected with it ?
The facts are, that appellant employed appellee to nurse him during an attack of sickness, promising to pay him well for his services. There was no agreement fixing the compensation to be paid, either for the entire service, or by'the hour, day, week, or month.
Appellant, before the present suit was brought, biit after the controversy arose, procured an assignment from one Mrs. Harrison of a debt which appellee owed her for board, and pleaded it as a setoff when sued by appellee. The court below held that the sum due appellee was for current wages for personal services, and „could not be offset as attempted.
The meaning of the language “current wages for personal services,” was considered by the Court of Appeals in First National Bank v. Graham, and the terms were defined as follows: “ Current means running, now passing or present in its progress. Wages means a compensation given to a hired person for his services. Current wages are such compensation for personal services as are to be paid periodically, or from time to time, as the services are rendered; as when the services are to be paid for by the hour, day, week, month, or year. The services rendered must be such as that the compensation therefor is measured by the time of the continuance of the service.” It was held that the fee of an attorney is not exempt from garnishment 61 where he has not been hired for his services by the day, week, month, or year, to be paid at the expiration of the time for which he was hired, and not in proportion to the business done.”
In case of Lydnor v. The City of Galveston, 15 Southwestern Reporter, 202, the same court held, that the fees of a physician, where he was employed and his compensation fixed per diem, were exempt. See also Bell v. Live Stock Company, 11 Southwestern Reporter, 344, in which the meaning of “ current wages” is discussed, but not authoritatively decided.
The difference between the first case and this seems to be, that in the former an attorney was employed at a compensation fixed for given services, without regard to time; while here no compensation was agreed on, but the amount appellee should receive necessarily depended upon the length of time he served.
The mere circumstance that the rate of compensation is not agreed on in advance ought not, in our opinion, to take the case out of the exemption. In nursing, appellee was actually occupied by the day, and his-right to compensation accrued as he served, being measured by customary or reasonable rates rather than by express contract. The remuneration to which he thereby became entitled was certainly ‘1 compensation to-a hired person for services;” and it was current, because it was accruing during the continuance of his service, and because its amount was measured by the time of his employment. The contract, it is true, did not fix the rate for stated periods of time, nor can we see anything in the language of the law to make the exemption depend on that circumstance. The accrual of his right to payment for his services was concurrent with the time during which he rendered them.
The language used in the opinions referred to must be restricted to the facts of the cases then before the court.
We therefore hold that the sum due appellee was correctly held to be current wages for personal services.
The question remains wjiether or not the demand for current wages could be offset by an ordinary debt.
We will limit our decision to the facts of this case. The statute provides, that “ the following property shall be exempt from attachment or execution, or every other species of forced sale for the payment of debts,” and in the enumeration of subjects exempted includes “ all current wages for personal services.” This language is used with reference to property which is usually subjected to payment of debts by the writs named. The terms employed would be wholly inapplicable if used with reference to debts due for wages alone, for they are not reached by being levied upon. They had already been exempted from garnishment by the Constitution and by the statute. Rev. Stats., art. 218; Const., art. 16, sec. 28. The mention of them in the provision above quoted was intended, in our judgment, to express the legislative intent that they should not be subjected to debt in any way except by the consent of the debtor; in other words, that they should be exempted from an enforced application to the discharge of debts. We need not consider what discounts arising out of the transactions between the master and servant, pending the employment of the latter, the former may deduct from the wages in settlement. No such questions arise here. The setoff pleaded accrued to another person, and had no connection with the contract of service, so far as the answer alleges. Had Mrs. Harrison garnished appellant, she could not have reached by that process the debt which he owed appellee, and, in our opinion, she can not accomplish the same result indirectly by assigning the claim and having it pleaded as a setoff. This question is decided m Colier v. Murphy, 16 Southwestern Reporter, 465 (Tennessee). See, also, William Deering Co. v. Ruffner, 49 Northwestern Reporter, 771.
The judgment is affirmed.

216212,N. W. Weaver v. City of Gainesville,1892-11-01,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
Appellant Weaver brought this suit in the District Court of Cooke County against the city of Gainesville, for a breach of an alleged verbal contract with said city, and, failing to recover, has appealed from the judgment of the court below.
The single question presented for our determination arises.upon the exclusion from the jury of certain testimony offered by appellant.
On or about the 3rd day of May, 1887, appellant executed and delivered to the appellee a deed in the usual form, conveying a certain piece of land situated in said city of Gainesville, reciting a consideration of Si, cash in hand paid. This deed bears date May 3, 1887; was acknowledged on the 5th day of May, and recorded on the 19th day of May, 1887. It contained, after the part which conveyed and described the land, the following provision: 11 The aforesaid is deeded by me to the city of Gainesville forth e purpose of widening said West Hudson Street to Elm Creek, and the said property is to be used alone for said purpose. The city council, through its proper authority, to cause the removal and placing of my fixtures upon the proper line in accordance with this deed. ’ ’ Then follows the usual form, “ together with all the rights, members, hereditaments,” etc. The minutes of the proceedings of the city council of Gainesville contain the following entries: “April 19, 1887, on motion of Alderman Brooks the question of opening up Elm Street West, also the straightening up of Hudson Street, was referred to a special committee, consisting of Brooks and Howeth, with instructions to investigate a.nd report to the city council at its next regular meeting.” “May 3, said committee given further time.” “May 17, committee given further time.” “ May 17, the special committee to whom was referred the matter of straightening up West Hudson Street, reported that they had secured deeds from Curtis Blackwood and N. W. Weaver to a sufficient amount of land lying along said street to straighten the same. Report adopted and deed ordered recorded.”
Appellant proved by W. L. Fletcher, her father, that on or about the 3rd day of May, 1887, being thereunto duly authorized by appellant, he went upon the ground in controversy with said Brooks and Howeth, and agreed with them that, in consideration that the city would fill up a certain objectionable ditch on said land, adjacent to other land of appellant, and put the streets in good condition, with the proper drainage, and remove appellant’s fence to her north boundary line, appellant would convey the land in controversy to the city; which agreement was fully assented to by Brooks and Howeth (according to the testimony of said Fletcher), and the terms of the same reported by him to appellant, who assented thereto and made the conveyance above described. Rome proof was also introduced by appellant of subsequent conversations with the mayor of said city and with the chairman of committee on street improvement, to the effect that said ditch would be filled up and the street put in proper condition. The proof of the verbal agreement was all excluded from the jury, because the deed introduced in evidence was the contract of the parties, and the above testimony sought to vary a written contract by parol testimony, and the court announced that he would not permit the introduction of any further testimony which sought to show that in addition to the considerations expressed in' the deed there was a contract by the city to fill and drain the ditch aforesaid, and to properly drain and grade the street, etc. The court signed the bill of exceptions, setting forth the above proceedings, with the explanation, “ That defendant’s counsel objected to the testimony of witnesses as to what Brooks and Howeth and other aldermen stated, as to how Mayor Rowland acted and what he said in reference to matters in controversy, because no one of them had the power lawfully to bind the city, and it was not shown that the city, in its corporate capacity, ever ratified either of their acts or their statements; and while this can have no effect upon the present appeal, because plaintiff did not conclude the introduction of his testimony, we invite the action of the court upon this point, in order to settle the question on another trial in case this case is reversed.”
It appeared upon the trial that appellant owned valuable residence property adjacent to West Hudson Street, which was rendered unsaleable by the ditch and defective drainage sought to be obviated, and that the inducement to her to execute the deed was to have said ditch filled and the street improved, so as to render said vacant residence property sale-able.
The line which separates the exceptions, real or apparent, from the rule which excludes oral testimony where a valid written instrument has been executed between the parties, is sometimes very difficult to trace. We find this case very near that line.
It seems to be well settled, that “Where men have put into writing any portion of their terms of agreement, they can not alter by parol evidence that which they have written; and when the writing purports to be the whole of the agreement between the parties, it can neither be added to nor varied by parol evidence.” It is also laid down that the writing on its face should rebut the presumption that it is complete. It is, however, like other contracts, to be interpreted in the light of surrounding circumstances and the situation of the parties. In this case, if there had been nothing in the deed except the conveyance of the property for street purposes upon the nominal consideration of Si, the oral testimony should not have been excluded. We are of opinion, however, that inasmuch as the deed, after reciting this consideration and granting the land in the usual form, contained, in connection with limiting the extent and purpose of this conveyance, the stipulation that the city, through its proper authority, should perform certain acts for appellant, as set forth in the conclusions of fact, it purported on its face to contain the entire contract of the parties, even when read in the light of surrounding circumstances. While the widening of the street may have been of public benefit, it was also apparently beneficial to appellant; and as it was conveyed only for public use, we would not be warranted in presuming that any further or greater consideration was promised by the city than the expense of opening the street. There is no allegation that plaintiff was defrauded or that there was any mistake in the preparation or execution of the deed. Appellant simply declares upon the verbal contract, and claims damages for a breach thereof.
In Railway v. Garrett, 52 Texas, 133, appellant set up a failure of consideration in a deed to the right of way, on the ground that the railroad company had failed to locate a depot on his land, as verbally agreed when the deed was made, alleging that that was the consideration and inducement for the making of the deed. The consideration recited in the deed was the sum of $1, in hand paid, and the further consideration that the company would locate its railroad over the lands of appellant. In the opinion in that case we find this language: “As this deed was executed by the plaintiff and accepted by the defendant, this recital is more than a mere receipt of the payment of the purchase money; it is also the written evidence of a contract between the parties that the plaintiff would grant the right of way and that the defendant would construct its road over the same. To permit a parol contemporaneous condition to be engrafted upon a deed in writing, it should be upon proper allegation of fraud, accident, or mistake, and upon clear and satisfactory evidence. ” We think this case is in point. See also Railway v. McKinney, 55 Texas, 176; Purinton v. Railway, 46 Ill., 297.
Delivered November 1, 1892.
Our conclusion is, that the judgment of the court below must be affirmed, and it is accordingly so ordered.

219174,W. W. Gregory v. J. G. Goldthwaite et al.,1893-02-09,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
This action was brought in the County Court of Galveston County upon an appeal bond executed by the appellees in the case of Gregory v. Allison, tried in the Justice Court.
The facts are, as found by the county judge on the trial below, as follows:
“1. On July 29, 1889, the plaintiff, W. W. Gregory, recovered a judgment against one J. G. Allison in the Justice Court of Galveston County, Texas, precinct number 1, for the sum of $126, besides costs of suit, with interest on said judgment from its date at the rate of 8 per cent per annum; from which judgment said Allison appealed to the County Court of Galveston County, and filed a bond as an appeal bond, properly describing said judgment, in the sum of $300, with the defendants J. G. Goldthwaite and W. F. Breath as sureties. The said bond is payable to the plaintiff, Gregory, in said sum, and is “conditioned that the said J. G. Allison, appellant, shall prosecute his appeal with effect and shall pay all the costs which have accrued in the court below or which may accrue in the appellate court.” These were all the conditions of said bond. The bond was approved and filed by the justice of the peace July 31, 1889, and in due course of law the said justice of the peace made a transcript of the proceedings in said cause against said Allison, and transmitted same, together with the papers in the cause, to the County Court of Galveston County.
“2. On motion of said Gregory in the County Court of Galveston County, the said appeal of Allison was, on November 20, 1889, dismissed, because said bond was not conditioned as required by the statute, and writ of procedendo ordered to issue. From the judgment dismissing said appeal said Allison appealed to the Court of Appeals of Texas. The appeal to the Court of Appeals was upon a cost bond.
“3. At the Galveston Term, 1890, the honorable Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the County Court dismissing said appeal, and mandate was issued March 11, 1890.
“ 4. Said W. W. Gregory sued J. G. Goldthwaite and W. F. Breath, the sureties on said appeal bond from said Justice Court to said County Court, and defendants herein, in the Justice Court for precinct number 1, Galveston County, on October 13, 1890, alleging and proving that since the execution of said appeal bond in said cause number 2556, the defendant, J. G. Allison, had become notoriously insolvent, and that the judgment in said cause number 2556 for the sum of $126 and interest thereon from July 29, 1889, at 8 per cent per annum, and costs, was still due and unpaid, and no part thereof was paid.
“5. The evidence showed that said Gregory exercised diligence in endeavoring to collect said judgment of $126 and interest and costs aforesaid, in that he caused execution to issue promptly after the judgment of .affirmance in said Court of Appeals, and subsequently caused execution to issue to Dallas County, where said Allison removed shortly after the judgment was obtained against him in said Justice Court, and that although said Gregory exercised such diligence, no property was found belonging to said Allison subject to execution.”
Our conclusion is that the judgment of the court below ought to be affirmed. The appeal bond sued on was not good as a statutory bond, and an action could be maintained on it, if at all, only as a voluntary common law bond, as upon a contract between the parties. It is clear that the minds of the parties never met in a contract. On the contrary, the appeal to the County Court in the case of Gregory v. Allison was dismissed on the motion of Gregory, because no sufficient bond had been filed.
We are cited to the cases of Trent v. Rhomberg, 66 Texas, 249, and Wooldridge v. Rawlings, 14 Southwestern Reporter, 667; but in both of those cases the bonds were good statutory bonds; and in the first case the appeal was dismissed for the want of prosecution, while in the latter the appellant consented to the dismissal.
The suit must be maintained either because the bond was a good statutory bond or good as a voluntary common law bond. As a statutory bond, it was only a bond for costs on appeal from the District or County Court to the appellate court (Revised Statutes, article 1400); and not at all conditioned as required by law for an appeal from the Justice Court. Rev. Stats., art. 1639. It was not good as a voluntary common law bond, because it was never agreed to or ratified by the plaintiff. Wooters v. Smith, 56 Texas, 198.
The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.

216308,W. E. Harrington et al. v. C. H. McFarland et al.,1892-11-01,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
W. E. Harrington and wife brought suit in the District Court of Grayson County against C. H. McFarland and the city of Sherman, to recover their alleged homestead in said city, which went off on demurrer; and from that judgment, rendered on the 25th day of December, 1889, this appeal is prosecuted.
Appellants alleged in their petition, to which demurrers were sustained,, that on the 7th day of March, 1887, they owned in community right a. homestead in the city of Sherman, which was occupied by them as such,, they being husband and wife and having one child; that at said date the-city of Sherman claimed an indebtedness against W. E. Harrington of $4000, due from him as a defaulting tax collector of said city, and that, he had embezzled said sum; that R G. Hall, Jake Levy, M. Schneider, J. H. Brittain, Jot Gunter, W. H. AVilliams, A. W. Gray, and A. Harrington were his sureties on his official bond, and that a suit was pending in the District Court of said county against W. E. Harrington and sureties, to recover the amount above named; that about the same time the sureties, or most of them, held a meeting and sent A. Harrington to Janie Harrington, appellant herein, to tell her that if she did not sign the. deed to the lot in controversy, they would prosecute her husband and, send him to the penitentiary; that she was unwilling to sign the deed,, but was so frightened at said threat, and was so alarmed for the safety of her husband, that on the 7th day of March, 1887, she and her husband did sign and acknowledge the deed by which they conveyed the property in controversy to said city, the same being worth about $2500; that the sole consideration for the conveyance ivas the payment of said indebtedness; that R G. Hall and J. W. Levy, two of the sureties who made the threat, were at the time the deed was made aldermen of said city, and were present at the meeting of the council of said city at which the deed was accepted by it, and thereby the said city had notice of the fact that she had been induced by threats to sign the deed, and that she did not sign the same willingly; that she was not examined privily by the officer who took her acknowledgment, but that J. AY. Levy, one of the said sureties who had threatened her, was present when the acknowledgment was taken, and that the deed was not explained to her by the officer; and that C. H. McFarland bought the property with actual notice of the above facts, and had paid no consideration therefor.
The general demurrer and the special exceptions, to the effect that the petition was insufficient to fix upon the city notice of the circumstances under which the deed was taken, because it showed that Hall and Levy, instead of acting as agents of the city, were acting for their own benefit, and adversely to the city, and that the allegation of a past due indebtedness as the sole consideration was insufficient, were sustained by the court, and appellants declined to amend.
Appellants alleged, in a supplemental petition, that the city of Sherman made a proposition to the sureties on said bond, that if they would procure from appellants a deed to the property in controversy to said city, that it would accept it in full satisfaction of the debt, and upon this being done the suit on the bond was dismissed.
Appellants’ main proposition under the first assignment of error reads as follows:
“Two of the aldermen of the city of Sherman participated in the threats by which the deed was secured; the city had beforehand agreed to accept the deed if procured, and the two aldermen were present at the meeting of the city council when the deed was accepted by the city, which was notice to the city of the fact that the deed was procured by the threats. ’ ’
As we understand the allegations in appellants’ pleadings, the two aldermen who were present in the city council when the deed was accepted were interested, with other sureties on the bond of W. E. Harrington, in procuring the deed from said Harrington and wife to said city.
The alleged agreement of said city with said sureties to accept the deed and release them from liability on the bond if they would procure it to be made, does not seem to us to establish the relation of principal and agent, but shows rather that the sureties, including the two aldermen, occupied the attitude toward the city of independent contractors. Our conclusion is, that these two aldermen were interested adversely to the city in procuring said deed to be made in order to secure their release from liability on said bond. The fact that they were present in the city council when the deed was accepted would not charge the city with notice of the circumstances under which it was procured. The knowledge of an agent acquired in the transaction of his own private business is not ordinarily imputed to the principal. Kauffman & Runge v. Robey, 60 Texas, 308. As to whether such knowledge is imputed to the principal, if present to the mind of the agent while subsequently engaged in a transaction for the principal, the authorities are conflicting. One of the grounds upon which said knowledge is imputed is, that it is the duty of the agent to •communicate it to the principal. This being the reason of the rule, it is held that the rule does not apply where the agent has a personal interest in a matter which would lead him to conceal his knowledge from his principal, though cases may be found in conflict with this holding. Bank v. Davis, 2 Hill, 451; Bank v. Cushman, 121 Mass., 490; Fairfield v. Bank, 72 Me., 226; Wickersham v. Zinc Co., 18 Kans., 481.
Delivered November 1, 1892.
. If these two aldermen had been guilty of obtaining the wife’s signature and acknowledgment by means of duress and fraud, as alleged by appellants, it is morally certain that they would not have communicated this knowledge to the city council — the governing body of said city — when said deed was accepted; and we therefore think that their knowledge of the alleged fraud should not be imputed to the city.
The second assignment raises the question that the city must be deemed to have had notice, because it parted with no new consideration for the conveyance, but accepted it solely in satisfaction of a pre-existing debt. Were it not for the case of Webb v. Burney, 70 Texas, 322, we would be inclined to sustain this contention of appellants. That case, however, is directly in point, and for that reason alone we hold that this assignment is not well taken; and also, for the same reason, that the third and last assignment is not well taken.
It follows from these conclusions that the judgment of the court below"" must be affirmed, and it is accordingly so ordered.

216291,William Muller et al. v. The City of Denison et al.,1892-11-01,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This suit was brought by the appellants against the appellees, in the District Court of Grayson County, to enjoin the collection of certain taxes assessed and levied by the appellees.
The injunction was temporarily granted, but on final hearing it was dissolved. Hence this appeal.
Denison was a city with a population of more than 10,000 inhabitants. It was organized under the general law, having accepted the benefits of title 17 of the Revised Statutes. The taxes sought to be enjoined were covered by an ordinance authorizing the collection of taxes for the year 1888, as follows:
Section 1. One-fourth of 1 per cent for current expenses.
Section 2. One-fifth of 1 per cent for interest, and sinking fund on bonded indebtedness.
Section 3. Three-eighths of 1 per cent for maintaining schools.
Section 4. One-half of 1 per cent for protection against fire.
Section 5. One-fourth of 1 per cent for improving streets, etc.
Section 6. One twenty-fifth of-1 per cent for sinking fund for school bonds issued April 2, 1888.
Section 7. One-twentieth of 1 per cent for interest on school bonds issued April 2, 1888.
Section 8. One-fourth of 1 per cent for paying outstanding floating indebtedness.
Section 9. Provides for poll tax.
Appellants claim that the taxes included under sections 4 and 8, above set out, were levied wholly without authority, and those referred to in section 5 partly without authority. They allege as to the latter, that for the purpose of improving streets and of constructing permanent improvements, including school houses, the city was limited to an. ad valorem tax of 25 cents on the $100, and, admitting the legality of the tax referred to in sections 6 and 7, they contend, as the evidence showed them to have been levied for the purpose of building school houses, that, to the extent of this tax (9 cents on the $100), the levy referred to in section 5 was excessive. Appellants also claim that the tax referred to in section 8 was illegal, because the “ outstanding floating indebtedness” therein referred to had been incurred for current expenses, and should be included in the item 1 ‘ current expenses;” and that for current expenses the power of the city is limited to a levy of 25 cents on the $100, already exhausted in section 1. They further contend, that the taxes referred to in section 4 were illegal, because the city was without authority to levy taxes for protection against fire. As to the remainder of the sections, they admit the legality of the levy.
It will be noted that the aggregate tax levied by the ordinance in question does not amount to 2.) per cent on the $100. Hence, the appellees claim, that as Denison was a city of more than 10,000 inhabitants, it was authorized to levy all the taxes included in the ordinance, and this by virtue of article 426 of the Revised Statutes, which is as follows: “ Cities having more than 10,000 inhabitants may levy, assess, and collect such taxes as may be authorized by law, but no tax for any purpose shall ever be levied for any one year which shall exceed 2-¡- per cent of the taxable property of such city.”
The question presented then is this: Was the city of Denison authorized, under the article named, and as found by the lower court, to levy a tax of 25 cents on the $100 to pay outstanding floating indebtedness, incurred for current expenses, though it had already assessed the same amount for current expenses; and further, was it authorized to levy the tax of 50 cents on the $100 for protection against fire; and further, was it authorized to levy a tax of 25 cents on the $100 for improving streets, though it had levied a tax of 9 cents on the $100 for the building of school houses — the entire levy not amounting to as much as 2-|- per cent of the taxable property of said city ?
The scheme of municipal taxation, as devised by the framers of our Constitution, proceeds upon different planes, according as it refers to-cities and towns with a population of less than 10,000, and to cities with a population of more than 10,000 inhabitants. This is evident from the organic provisions on this subject, and from the legislation had thereunder. Thus, section 4, article 11, of the Constitution, provides: “ Cities and towns having a population of 10,000 inhabitants or less * * may levy, assess, and collect an annual tax to defray the current expenses-of their local, government, but such tax shall never exceed, for any one year, one-fourth of 1 per cent.”
On the other hand, section 5 of the same article is to the following effect: “ Cities having more than 10,000 inhabitants may levy, assess, and collect such taxes as may be authorized by law, but no tax for any purpose shall ever be lawful for any one year which shall exceed 2-J- percent of the taxable property of such city.” * -* *
So, in evident conformity to these provisions, articles 425 and 426 respectively of the Revised Statutes were adopted. They fix a similar-limit. The graver burdens and the more important functions of cities of the latter class demanded the difference in the extent of the powers conferred.
It is insisted by appellants, however, that cities with a population of more than 10,000 inhabitants were powerless to act under the provisions referred to until such time as they should be ‘1 authorized by law.” Appellants interpret the expression “authorized by law” to mean that the Legislature must have specifically provided the extent and method of taxation before warrant therefor would exist.
Cities are charged by the statutes with the duty of protecting their inhabitants from contagious diseases; of providing for their debts and expenses; of providing water for the “ extinguishment of fire and the convenience of their inhabitants;” and of controlling and repairing their streets and highways. To meet such purposes constitutes, mainly, the reason for municipal existence. These duties can not be discharged without money, and to raise money taxation must be resorted to. ‘ ‘ When such a corporation is created, the power of taxation (within the constitutional and charter limit) is vested in it as an essential attribute for all the purposes of its existence, unless its exercise is by express terms prohibited.” United States v. New Orleans, 98 U. S., 381.
We therefore conclude, that as the taxes complained of were levied for the purpose of enabling the city of Denison- to discharge the statutory duties which it owed to its inhabitants, and as it did not exceed the limit fixed by the Constitution and the law thereunder, the levy was “ authorized by law,” and should be upheld within the limit named, and the article-in question should be construed to vest the authority to levy the taxes, provided it was called for in the discharge of a duty elsewhere imposed. by the law upon the city. The application of the tax fund, when collected, to the different purposes of corporate existence is.left to the discretion of its authorities, in the absence of special statutory direction.
Delivered November 1, 1892.
Thus, not having exceeded the limit of 2\ per cent, the city council was empowered to levy a tax of one-half of 1 per cent for protection against fire, of. one-fourth of 1 per cent for improving its streets, and of one-fourth of 1 per cent for paying its outstanding floating indebtedness. Since the institution of this proceeding the article in question has been amended by the Act of 1889, limiting the power of taxation of the cities of the character named to one-half of 1 per cent of the taxable property of the city. This statute, however, being subsequent, can not influence the disposition of the question here presented
The levy of 25 cents on the §100 for improving streets is not affected, as contended for by appellants, by the levy for school house purposes, admittedly valid and provided for in sections 6 and 7 of the ordinance. These sections were enacted under the act of the Legislature of March 23, 1887. With reference to this act, we deem it sufficient to say that in our opinion it did not operate as a repeal of article 426. It was enacted with reference to the constitutional amendment of 1883, amending section 9, article 8, of the State Constitution. This section in no way impairs the effect of section 5, article 11, above referred to, and of article 426, Revised Statutes, here construed. Lufkin v. Galveston, 63 Texas, 438.
It is therefore ordered that the judgment be affirmed.

219233,Sol Maier et al. v. The State of Texas,1893-02-16,"GARRETT, Chief Justice
This is a suit, in the name of the State of Texas, on a liquor dealer’s bond, to recover the penalty for a breach of the conditions of the bond, that the liquor dealer would not permit to be sold in his place of business malt liquor to any person under the age of twenty-one years.
The petition set out the bond, which is dated March 6, 1891, and is conditioned in the terms of the statute. It was alleged that the defendant executed the bond for the purpose of procuring a retail license to sell spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors, or medicated bitters capable of producing intoxication, in quantities less than a quart, in the city of Palestine and county of Anderson; and that the license was issued on the 7th day of March, A. D. 1891.
The breach of the bond was alleged as follows: 1 ‘ Plaintiff would further show, that notwithstanding the bond and obligation of the said Sol Maier and his sureties as aforesaid, that heretofore, to-wit, on or about the-day of-, 1891, in violation of the bond and obligation of said Sol Maier to the State of Texas, one Albert Maier, who was then and there the agent and employe of Sol Maier, was then and there acting as such, did sell or give, or permit to be given, to Rob Rodgers spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors, or medicated bitters capable of producing intoxication, the said Rob Rodgers then and there being a minor under the age of twenty-one years, in violation of the said bond to the State as aforesaid; whereby the said defendants have become liable to the State of Texas, for the use and benefit of the county of Anderson, in the penal sum of $500, for which sum the State here sues.”
Trial was had without a jury, and judgment was rendered in favor of the State of Texas, for the use and benefit of the county of Anderson, against the defendants, Sol Maier, as principal, and A. A. Stevens and J. F. Pells, as sureties, for the sum of $500, the penalty sued for. Defendants filed motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial, which were overruled by the court.
The facts are, as found by the court below, as follows: “That after giving the bond set out in the petition, defendant Maier kept a saloon in Palestine, Anderson County, Texas, for the sale of alcoholic, vinous, and malt liquors, and medicated bitters capable of producing intoxication. That on the-day of September, 1891, his clerk and bartender, Albert Maier, sold or gave to Rob Rodgers, a minor under the age of twenty-one years, a glass of beer, the kind of which is not shown except as it may be inferred. The facts are, that the minor entered the saloon in company with several persons, one of whom, an adult, ordered beer for them all, whereupon the bartender placed upon the bar a glass of beer for each of the party. While the glass put out for the minor was still on the bar, his father, who had seen him go into the saloon, entered and called to the clerk not to let his son drink the beer, stating that he was a minor. The clerk did not hear at first what was said, and advanced to where the father was standing, leaving the minor at the other end of the bar, and asked the father what he said, upon which the latter repeated his statement. To this the clerk replied, that he could not help it; that the other gentlemen ordered the beer. The evidence conflicts as whether the clerk could have then prevented the minor from drinking the beer, and I hold it to be immaterial whether he could or not. The minor, not seeing his father, drank the beer. The bartender refused to take pay for the beer which the minor drank. Defendant Maier was not present, and did not know of the transaction. He had instructed the clerk not to sell liquor to minors, nor allow them about the saloon. From the conduct of the parties at the time, and other facts stated, I conclude that the beer was malt liquor, capable of producing intoxication.”
1. The purpose of a motion in arrest of judgment is to present to a court after trial such matters as before trial might have been presented by demurrer. Machon v. Randle, 66 Texas, 282. The allegation in the petition, that the agent and employe of Sol Maier, acting as such, sold the liquor, is sufficient to show a breach of the bond in that respect. The bond was set out in full in the petition, and it was alleged that it was executed for the purpose of procuring a license to sell liquors in the city of Palestine, in the county of Anderson; it was also alleged, that the license was issued, and that in violation of the bond and obligation, the sale was made as alleged. It sufficiently appears from the allegations stated above, that the defendant Sol Maier had executed a bond and had obtained license to do business as a liquor dealer in the city of Palestine, in the county of Anderson, and in the course of such business had sold the liquor in violation of the conditions of the bond. The allegation as to date necessarily showed that it was after the execution of the bond, and was at least good on general demurrer. There was no error in overruling the motion in arrest of judgment.
2. It is contended by counsel for appellants, that because the defendant Sol Maier was not present and did not know of the transaction, and had instructed his clerk not to sell liquors to minors, a breach was not shown of the condition of the bond, that he would not permit liquors to be sold to a minor. When the defendant undertook that he would not permit liquors to be sold to minors in his house or place of business, he obligated himself that liquors should not be so sold; not that he would not knowingly permit them to be sold, but that he would prohibit or prevent its being done. The intent of the defendant to violate the condition of the bond is not to be considered in construing it. By the condition he must not permit nor allow liquors to be sold to a minor in his place of business. He must so conduct his business as to prevent it. If this were a prosecution for a violation of the Penal Code, it would be necessary to show that the sale was knowingly made; but there is no such restriction in the law prescribing the conditions of a liquor dealer’s bond, which is required by ""the civil statutes as a restriction on the right of a person to sell liquors, and to prevent the evils arising therefrom. McGuire v. Glass, 15 S. W. Rep., 127; O’Flinn v. The State, 5 So. Rep., 390.
In construing the obligation sued on in this case, no such meaning will be given the word ‘ ‘ permit ” as is attached to it in Harris v. The State, 5 Texas, 15, which was a prosecution upon an indictment under the gambling act, for permitting a faro bank to be kept and exhibited in the defendant’s house. In that case the court held, that by a fair construction of the language of the law, a knowledge of the forbidden fact was a constituent ingredient of the offense; yet there are many offenses for which the principal is criminally liable for the acts of his agent. The case before us is a civil action on a bond which was voluntarily entered into by the defendant, and does not involve the idea of intent that generally enters into acts which are done in violation of a penal statute, and for which there is a criminal prosecution.
3. Proof that the liquor was sold or given by an agent or employe of the defendant to the minor Rob Rodgers was sufficient to show a breach of the bond by the defendant himself, other necessary facts having been shown. The language of the condition of the bond is, that the licensee ‘ ‘ will not sell or permit to be sold,’ ’ which of itself involves the idea of agency. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 3226a, sec. 4. Many of the authorities which are apparently against this position arise from criminal prosecutions, or from the particular language of the statute.
The American and English Encyclopedia of Law (volume 11, page 718) collates quite a number of authorities, from which it states the rule to be, that “ a sale of liquor to a minor by an agent, clerk, or bartender of the owner of a saloon or drug store, is a sale by the owner, for which he is liable when it was made in the regular course of the master’s, lawful business, although the sale was made without his knowledge, and in violation of his bona fide instructions to such agent, clerk, or bartender. For a well considered discussion of the question, and a review of the law applicable to the subject, we refer to the case of State v. Kittelle (North Carolina Supreme Court), 15 Southeastern Reporter, 103, in which it was said, that “ the law looks to the responsible. party, the licensee, who has been permitted to carry on the calling, and who is responsible for its proper exercise.”
4. Under the facts found by the court, we are of the opinion that there-was, if not a sale, at least a giving of the beer to the minor. A glass of beer was set out on the bar for him, and he drank it. The fact that the-bartender refused pay for it, after his attention was called to the matter by the father of the boy, can make no difference. People v. Neumann, 48 N. W. Rep., 290; The State v. Best, 12 S. E. Rep., 907. The case of Seigle v. People, cited by appellant, is discussed in the case of People v. Neumann, supra, and while the court rests its decision on the difference between the Illinois statute, which is like ours, and that of Michigan, which goes further and uses the word “furnish” in defining the offense of giving, selling, or furnishing liquor to a minor, the learned judge who delivered the opinion expressed himself as not satisfied with the reasoning of the case. We think the facts in this case bring it clearly within the conditions of the bond. The liquor, upon the order of the adult, was set out upon the bar for the minor, and the minor drank it.
5. The proof was that the bartender sold or gave the minor a glass of beer, and it is contended that this is not sufficient proof that he sold or gave him any spirituous, vinous, or malt liquor, or medicated bitters capable of producing intoxication. We are of the opinion that the limitation, “ capable of producing intoxication,” applies only to “medicated bitters.” Is, then, proof of the sale or gift of “beer” proof of the sale or -gift of “ malt liquors ? But it seems to be well settled that the word “ beer,” in its ordinary sense, denotes a beverage which is intoxicating, and is within the fair meaning of the words 1 ‘ strong or spirituous liquors,” used in statutes regulating the sale of such liquors. 11 Am. and Eng. Encycl. of Law, 579; and a number of authorities there cited pro and con.
“Beer” is defined to be “a fermented liquor made from any malted grain, with hops and other bitter flavoring matters;” also, as a fermented extract of the roots and other parts of various plants, as spruce, ginger, sassafras, etc. Webster’s Die. Its primary signification is, that it is a malt liquor; and if it is to be understood in a restricted or qualified sense, such as to denote root beer, molasses beer, or persimmon beer, etc., it would be incumbent upon the defendant to show that such is the case. There have been a great many decisions upon the subject, some of them evincing much learning; and in Briffit v. The State, 16 Northwestern Reporter, 39, there will be found a reference to some of them to sustain the view, that the court will take judicial notice that the word “ beer,” when used in court by a witness, means a malt and an intoxicating liquor. It would have been competent for the defendant to have shown that the glass of beer sold or given to the minor was not malt liquor; but having failed to do so, the presumption is that it was such, because it is commonly understood to be such, and words are generally to be understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.
The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered February 16, 1893.
Justice Williams did not sit in this case."
216263,Western Union Telegraph Company v. W. A. Evans,1892-11-01,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
At about 10 o’clock on the 4th day of March, 1889, appellee, through his agent, delivered to the agent of appellant at Gainesville, Texas, the following telegram:
“Gainesville, Texas, March 4, 1889.
“ To A. C. Evans, Mount Vernon, Texas:
“ Go to Henry Simpson and get $50. You and your ma come. Luther better.
“ W. A. Evans.”
At the time of delivering this message to appellant’s agent he was informed of its importance, and was paid the usual charges for its transmission. The message was forwarded by appellant’s agent in due time, and was received at Mount Vernon at 11:35 a. m. of the same day. The delivery of the message to A. C. Evans was delayed at Mount Vernon until about 9 o’clock of the day after its receipt, from the fact that he lived some two or three miles in the country, beyond the free delivery limits of appellant at said place, and its agent at Mount Vernon had not been advised that payment had been made for special delivery in time on the day preceding for it to have been delivered on that day.
About an hour after the delivery of the message to appellant’s agent at Gainesville, W. A. Evans, the sender of the message, called at appellant’s office, and was informed by its agent that the message would not be delivered unless an additional payment was made to cover a special delivery, and thereupon Evans paid to said agent $2, the amount demanded for this purpose, and urged upon the agent the necessity for a speedy delivery.
The usual time required to send a message from. Gainesville to Mount Vernon was about ten minutes. Had the agent at Gainesville notified the agent at Mount Vernon of the deposit to cover the special delivery, the message could have been delivered on March 4; and had it been so delivered, appellee’s wife, the mother of Luther, referred to in the message, could have reached Gainesville on the evening of March 5, in time to have been with her son Luther about twenty-four hours previous to his death; but not having been delivered until March 5, she was unable to reach her son until the evening of March 6, about twenty minutes after his death.
A. C. Evans, the person to whom the message was addressed, anticipating such a message, on March 3 had arranged with appellant’s agent at Mount Vernon, in case such a message for him was received, to deliver the same to a Mrs. Foster, who lived in a short distance of appellant’s office at said place, and who had agreed to attend to the prompt delivery of the same; and had appellant’s agent complied with this arrangement when the message was received on March 4, it would have been delivered to appellee’s wife in time for her to have reached the bedside of her son on March 5, whether any sum had been paid for the special delivery or not.
Appellee sued for damages alleged to have been caused to his wife from the mental anguish suffered by her on account of her failure to see her son before his death; and upon the trial the jury awarded him the sum of $5000; and judgment being rendered upon this verdict, appellant prosecutes this appeal.
The verdict of the jury finding negligence on the part of appellant in the delivery of said message was well sustained by the evidence.
The petition of appellee contained an allegation to the effect that his son Luther, prior to his death, frequently called for his mother, and desired to talk with her before dying, and constantly urged plaintiff to procure, some means to bring her to him; and appellant’s third assignment of error calls in question the action of the court in overruling its special exception to this portion of the petition. We are of opinion that the action of the court was correct.
This suit was instituted to recover damage for the mental anguish claimed to have been caused appellee’s wife by her failure to see her son before his death, and we are , not prepared to say that the jury would not be authorized to conclude that this anguish would be increased by the knowledge that her son wished to see her, and was unable to do so. In such ease the damage would be for the injury thereby caused the wife, and not.for any damage that might have been suffered by the son. In this case, however, no injury could have resulted to appellant, as no evidence was offered upon the trial to sustain this allegation.
Delivered November 1, 1892.
In its eleventh assignment of error appellant complains that the court below refused a special charge requested by it, to the effect that it was not required to deliver a message beyond the free delivery limits until special compensation for this service had been secured to it, and if the jury found such payment was made too late for the message to reach Mount Vernon prior to the regular hour for closing appellant’s office at said point, it would not be guilty of negligence.
We think the charge of the court was all if not more than appellant had the right to ask upon this branch of the case, as settled by previous decisions of our Supreme Court. Anderson v. Tel. Co., 84 Texas, 17; Tel. Co. v. Bruner, 19 S. W. Rep., 149; Tel. Co. v. Broesche, 72 Texas, 657; Thomp. on Law of Elec., 300.
Appellant’s thirteenth assignment complains of the verdict rendered as being grossly excessive in amount, and as being more in the nature of a punishment of defendant than compensation to plaintiff, and we are of opinion that this assignment is well taken. The verdict in this case was for $5000. We think-the appellee, had the message been promptly delivered, would have reached the bedside of her son about twenty-four hours before his death, but on account of the negligence of appellant she only reached him about twenty minutes after he had died. That her mental anguish was great can not be doubted, but in a case quite similar our Supreme Court held, as we think correctly, a verdict for $4500 such an amount as to shock a sense of justice, and concluded that it must have-been the result of passion or prejudice on the part of the jury; and so-we conclude in this case. Tel. Co. v. Houghton, 82 Texas, 562.
We have carefully examined the other assignments of error in appellant’s brief, and are of the opinion that there is nothing in any of them of which it can justly complain.
For the failure of the court below to grant to appellant a new trial on account of the excessive verdict of the jury, let the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.
Reversed and remanded."
216269,Western Union Telegraph Company v. F. E. Piner,1892-11-01,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On the 17th day of February, 1889, appellee’s mother delivered to appellant for transmission to him the following message:
“ Bonham, Texas, Feb. 17.
“ To F. E. Piner, Denton, Texas:
“ Tour father is no better; come on first train.
“ Sallie Finer.”
This message was received at appellant’s office in Denton about 6:46 o’clock p. m. on the day of its date, but was not delivered to appellee until between 8 and 9 o’clock a. m. of the next day. Had the message been received by appellee on the 17th he would have reached his father about 7:15 a. m. on the 18th, but not having been delivered on that day, he was delayed in reaching his father until about 1 o’ clock p. m. of the 18tli. During the morning of the 18th appellee’s father was conscious, but became unconscious before appellee reached him, and never afterward regained consciousness. Appellee was, however, with his father for about two days before his death, and was present at his burial. For the mental anguish caused to appellee by his failure to reach his father before he became unconscious he brought this suit, and recovered a verdict and judgment in the sum of $4750.
Appellant’s sixth assignment of error complains of the verdict and judgment as being excessive in amount, and we believe this assignment to be well taken.
Appellee’s father was a man about 73 years of age, while appellee was himself about 50; and while the evidence in this case discloses an unusual degree of affection and confidence existing between father and son, we are constrained to hold, in the light of previous decisions by our Supreme Court, that $4750 is too large an amount to be allowed solely as compensation for the mental anguish caused by the failure of appellee to be with his father while conscious during the very short time of which he was deprived by the negligence of appellant. Tel. Co. v. Houghton, 82 Texas, 561; Tel. Co. v. Evans, supra, 297.
Delivered November 1, 1892.
We have examined the other assignments of error contained in appellant’s brief, and are of opinion there is nothing in any of them of which it can justly complain. Several of the questions therein presented have been disposed of in the case of Western Union ""Telegraph Company v. Evans, this day decided by us, and cited above.
Let the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.
Reversed and remanded."
216265,The Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. J. W. Childers & Co.,1892-11-15,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On August 31, 1888, appellees delivered to appellant at Gainesville, Texas, 349 head of beef steers, to be transported over its line of railway to St. Louis, Missouri, and thence to Chicago, Illinois, over connecting lines. The cattle, however, were received by appellees, and disposed of in St. Louis without going to Chicago. By reason of insufficient bedding in the cars, delays on the route, and bad facilities at stopping places for feeding and resting, the cattle were damaged 82.50 per head, four steers were killed and six crippled. Appellees brought this suit for the damage so sustained, alleging the damage by reason of the four steers killed at 885.20, to the six steers crippled at $60.30, and a depreciation in value of 339 head at 82.50 per head, or 8678; and also claimed $10 paid for extra bedding; and in their prayer ask judgment for the sum of $833.50.
Upon the trial the killing of the four and the crippling of the six steers was proven, but no evidence was offered as to their value or the damage thereby caused. The depreciation in value of the 339 head was shown to have been as much as $2.50 per head, making $847.50. It will be noticed that there was a mistake made by appellees in their calculation i:i stating the damage to the 339 head at $678 instead of $847.50. A trial before a jury resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of appellees for $872.50, from which this appeal is prosecuted.
The verdict, finding negligence on the part of appellant, and the damage to the 339 head to the extent above set forth, is supported by the evidence. There was evidence that appellees purchased some extra bedding, but it is not shown what this cost. Appellant pleaded a general denial, and specially, “ that the cattle in question were shipped under a written contract executed by plaintiffs and defendant, whereby, for a valuable consideration, plaintiffs agreed with defendant that as a condition precedent to their right to recover any damages for any loss or injury to their said stock during the transportation thereof, or previous to unloading thereof for shipment, they would give notice in writing of their claim therefor to some agent or officer of defendant, or to its nearest station agent, or to the agent at the delivering station of the railroad which carries said stock to its destination, or to the nearest station agent or general officer of such delivering road, before said stock was removed from the point of delivery, or from the place of destination, and before said stock was mingled with other stock, within one day after the delivery of said stock at its point of destination, and before the same should have been removed, slaughtered, or mingled with other stock, to the end that such claim might be fully and fairly investigated; and that a failure to comply with the terms of said clause of their contract should be a complete bar to any recovery for any and all such claims. And defendant says that plaintiffs wholly failed to comply with their said contract or to give the notice therein provided for; and defendant says that it had a station agent at St. Louis, Missouri, which was the terminus of its line of road, and that its general offices and general officers were at St. Louis, Missouri, all of which was known to plaintiffs, who knew and saw said station agent at the time; and that the destination of said cattle by contract was Chicago, Illinois, to which place, if they were not delivered by defendant to plaintiffs at St. Louis by their consent, after leaving defendant’s line of railway at St. Louis they were transported by and over the-railway, which railway had at Chicago, their point of destination, a station and station agent and general officers known to plaintiffs, and operated a line of railway into Chicago, which was the terminus of said delivering road.”
The only question it is necessary for us to discuss in this case is the action of the court in sustaining the exception of appellees to the special answer of appellant, as set forth in the foregoing conclusions of fact. The exceptions so sustained by the court were:
1. Because the contract thus set up fails to show the name or place of residence of the general officer or station agent of defendant at St. Louis, Missouri, if any it had.
2. That said contract was illegal, unreasonable, against public policy, and voiu.
In the case of Railway v. Harris, 67 Texas, 172, it is said: “It may well be doubted if such a contract as is relied on in this case ought ever to be sustained. If the carrier seeks to make its liability to depend on notice to its officer or agent of the claim for damages, it would seem that the responsibility of determining who is an officer or agent of the carrier within the meaning of the contract should not be cast upon the shipper, but that the person and his locality to whom the notices must be given ought to be made certain by the contract itself, and especially so when the carrier is a corporation, and the property is to be delivered beyond the line of its road over another carrier.”
In Railway v. Fagan, 72 Texas, 132, it is said: “ If the shipper should make a contract to give such notice, it might be binding under our law if it was shown that there was such officer or agent at the point of destination, upon whom the notices could be conveniently served.”
In Railway v. Adams, 78 Texas, 374, Associate Justice Henry, in delivering the opinion of the court, says: “ The bill of lading contained a stipulation to the effect that claims for loss or damage must be presented to the delivering line within thirty-six hours after the arrival of the freight. The testimony showed that plaintiff’s residence was within a few hundred yards of the depot at which the freight was received. That she received it on Saturday afternoon, and did not open the trunk or box in which the goods were packed until the following Monday morning, and that she was sick during the interval. The court, we think, fairly and correctly submitted to the jury the question whether the stipulation with regard to the time within which the claim was required to be made was a reasonable one. It was proper to submit that issue to the jury instead of its being decided as a question of law by the court, as appellant contends it should have been.”
In Railway v. Greathouse, 82 Texas, 111, it is said: “ Without determining whether this provision in a contract such as this can in any case be enforced, we do not think the appellant has brought itself within the rules laid down in those cases that permit such contracts to be enforced and that recognize their validity. When such provisions of a carrier’s contract are enforced, it is upon the assumption that such agreement is a reasonable one, considered in the light of the subject matter of the contract and the circumstances and surroundings of the parties. To prove that such conditions in a contract are reasonable is a burden resting upon the carrier, who must show by proper pleadings and evidence the existence of facts that call for the enforcement of the conditions. There were no pleadings and proof whatever upon this question coming from the carrier.”
' We think it will be seen from the authorities above quoted, that in this State the validity of such a contract as the one pleaded by appellant depends upon the circumstances of each particular case, and that the circumstances to sustain such a contract must be set forth in the pleading and evidence of the carrier. Ordinarily we believe that a contract such as this, where the name and location of the agent to whom notice has to be given is not set forth in the contract, should be held unreasonable and invalid, but we are not prepared to say that this should be so in all cases. If the stock is to be delivered at a place where the carrier has a large number of agents and officers, we believe it would be unreasonable to require the shipper to take the responsibility of deciding which one of these is the authorized station agent, or which one of these is a general officer, within the meaning of a contract using these general terms. But if the delivery of the stock is to be made at a place where the carrier has only one agent, easily to be distinguished and easy of access, a contract which requires the notice in general terms to be given to the station agent at such place might not be unreasonable. We believe that the correct rule would be to hold that where the carrier pleads such a contract as this, in which the name of the agent or officer upon whom notice is to be served is not given, the pleading should be held bad, unless there be an additional allegation from which the jury might be authorized to find such contract to be reasonable as applied to the facts of that particular case; but when such allegations are made, it then becomes a question for the jury to decide as to whether or not the contract, under the evidence, is a reasonable one.
In this case appellant alleges that it had a station agent in St. Louis, Missouri, where the stock were delivered, and that appellees knew and saw said station agent at the time; and under this -allegation we believe it became a question for the jury to decide under the evidence as to whether or not the contract was a reasonable one under the circumstances. If appellees knew and saw the station agent within the time called for in their contract, and were then aware of the damage they had sustained, we are not prepared to say that the jury would not be required to find that their failure to give notice as called for in their contract would preclude them from recovering.
It will not be necessary for us to consider the other assignments of ■error, as upon another trial appellees will doubtless by amendment make the corrections in the figures and prayer complained of therein.
In its second assignment of error appellant complains of the charge of the court, in that it makes it liable for the failure to transport the cattle in the usual - time, irrespective of whether such failure or delay was negligent or not. We do not think the charge, when applied to the facts in evidence, is subject to the objection made to it.
Delivered November 15, 1892.

Reversed and remanded."
219063,John H. Burnett v. Virginia M. Cockshatt et al.,1893-02-23,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Trepass to try title by appellees against appellant, to recover the east half of 640 acres of land in Galveston County, patented to John S. Jones.
Defendant pleaded not guilty. Judgment was rendered for appellees, from which the appeal is taken. Prior to the 4th day of October, 1888, the title to the land sued for was in H. L. Mathews. On that day a corporation called the J. L. Mott Iron Works recovered judgments against Mathews, abstracts of which were filed and recorded in the office of the county clerk the same day. In indexing the record of the abstracts, the name of Mathews properly appeared alphabetically indexed under the letter M, and the name of the plaintiff was given properly there, but the name of the corporation, when the clerk undertook to place it alphabetically upon the index, in the column of plaintiffs, was stated thus, “Mott, J. L., Iron Works.”
Mathews had previously conveyed the land to his wife by deed, which had not been recorded, and of which the judgment creditor had no notice when the abstract of the judgments were recorded. Appellant claims under that deed. After the abstracts were recorded, the land was sold under the judgments and bought in for appellees. Their title, therefore, depends on the question whether or not the indexing of the abstracts was a sufficient compliance with the statutory provision requiring the name of each plaintiff and each defendant to be indexed alphabetically.
We think it was sufficient. While the indexing is made a necessary step in the creation of a lien, and while a substantial compliance with the statutory directions can not be dispensed with by the courts, there is no reason why the purpose of those requirements should be ignored. The object is to afford a ready means of information as to the names of persons in favor of and against whom judgment liens upon lands exist. When the index furnishes that, substantially as the law provides, the purpose is subserved; and the statute should not be construed so technically as to impose unnecessary difficulties upon the judgment creditor seeking to secure liens upon the property of his debtor.
The article “ the” is so habitually used in naming corporations, that it may be held, that for purposes like this it is not to be treated as forming any part of the name.
It in no way helps to distinguish one body from another, for it is used in connection with nearly all corporations in the legislation of the day.
The name. “Mott” is that which does identify this corporation, and seems more completely to do so than any other word in the name. The letters “J. L.” are evidently'the initials of some individual from whom the corporate body takes its name.
It is not probable that a prudent person, searching in the index for the name of this corporation, would omit to look for-the name “ Mott” under its proper letter.
The name of the judgment debtor, the most essential part of the indexing, is correctly stated, and in connection with it the name of the plaintiff is stated in full, as named in the charter. It seems evident therefore, that the index would give all the required information, substantially in. the manner designed by the statute.
The recording of the abstracts therefore fixed a lien upon the property superior to the right acquired by Mathews’ wife under her prior unrecorded deed.
When the judgments were transferred to Flanagan the lien passed with-them, and the sale vested in the purchaser the right acquired by the corporation, notwithstanding Flanagan and the purchaser may have had notice, at the time of such transfer and of the sales under executions, of the deed to Mrs. Mathews, and may have advanced no new considerations.
The court did not err in admitting in evidence the sheriff’s deed, and holding that it conveyed a title superior to that of appellant. The fact-that the transfers of the judgments were made to Flanagan m order that he might plead them in setoff against Mathews does not affect the question.
Affirmed.

219223,Sabine & East Texas Railway Company v. William Hanks,1893-02-23,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
This case has twice been before the . Supreme Court prior to this appeal. 73 Texas, 324; 79 Texas, 642. The killing of the child by the servants of appellant occurred in July, 1886, and in order to fix the liability upon the company, it was necessary for the plaintiff to show that the death was caused by gross negligence of such, servants. At the last trial the court’s charge contained the following instruction, which is assigned as error: “ But if you find that the deceased was not far enough from the track to be out of danger, and they, the servants of defendant company, could by the exercise of unusual care have stopped the engine in time to have prevented the accident, if any, but negligently ran on, then you will find for the plaintiff; and if you find that the deceased went back on the track, but that the servants of the defendant company could by the exercise of extraordinary diligence have stopped the engine and cars, but did not, you will find for plaintiff.”
This instruction misstated the law. Even in ordinary cases, where less than gross negligence would make the defendant liable, only ordinary care, and not “ unusual” care or “ extraordinary diligence,” would be required. Here it was necessary that gross negligence be shown, and the court so charged, but in applying the law to the facts, gave the instruction above quoted. "" #
This will necessitate a reversal of the case, as the evidence was such as to require that the question whether or not the child was killed through the gross negligence of appellants servants be left to the jury.
In the opinion delivered by the Supreme Court on the first appeal (73 Texas, 324), it was said: “Even if the servants saw the danger, the company was only responsible for their gross negligence. However, the question of negligence and of its degree usually depends upon the particular facts of each case, and a state of facts which would show ordinary negligence in case of the injury of a person who had arrived at years of discretion, might in case of a child establish gross negligence. The case must always be proportioned to the danger, and in cases like this, the danger to a child is obviously greater than it would be to an adult.” These remarks are obviously just and applicable to the facts of the case, but they were not intended to be given in charge to the jury.
The degree of care which the servants were required to use, so far as liability of appellant depended on it, was such as would exempt them from the charge of gross negligence, and whether or not that degree of care was used in this case was a question that should have been left to the jury. What particular acts or facts would constitute gross negligence should not be stated in the charge. The care should be proportioned to the danger, and the question whether or not there was gross negligence in the conduct of the servants operating the train should be determined with reference to all of the circumstances disclosed by the evidence. And if the circumstances, considered with reference to the dangers of the sitúatian, showed the exercise of so slight a degree of care as evinced a disregard of or indifference to the safety of the child, and if the death of the child was caused thereby, then, and not otherwise, defendant would be liable.
It was proper for the court to explain to the jury what constitutes negligence in general, in order to make them to understand the difference which the law has undertaken to make between ordinary negligence and gross negligence.
The court did not err in refusing to instruct a verdict for defendant. The question of its liability should be submitted to the jury, to depend upon proof by appellee that the death was caused by the gross negligence of appellant’s servants.
Reversed and remanded.

216305,Wichita Land and Cattle Company et al. v. V. S. J. Ward,1892-11-15,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
This case was tried before the court without a jury, and the facts are correctly set forth in the special findings filed in the court below, as follows:
The Board of Land Commissioners of Shelby County issued certificate No. 472 to H. Corzine as assignee of John Ransom, for one league and labor of land, dated May 19, 1838, and transferred on May 23, 1838, to F. M. Weatherred by said Corzine, by written transfer upon the back .thereof. This certificate was cancelled by the Commissioner of the General Land Office on April 23, 1853. Certificate No. 2817-2918, for one league and labor of land, was issued to F. M. Weatherred as assignee of H. Corzine, in accordance with an act of the Legislature of Texas, approved February 7, 1853, granting to H. Corzine, his heirs or assigns, a league and labor of land; said special act of the Legislature providing that no certificate should issue if a certificate for a like quantity of land had been previously issued.
On July 3, 1854, certificate No. 3561-3662 (for unlocated balance of said certificate No. 2817-2918) for 17,553,925 square varas of land, was issued to Francis M. Weatherred, assignee of H. Corzine, said certificate being that by virtue of which the land in controversy was located. The land in controversy was patented to W. R D. Ward, assignee of H. Cor-zine, May 10, 1855.
H. Corzine was a married man, and died without issue in June, 1840-Ilis father was dead at the time of taking Elizabeth White’s deposition, August 8, 1888, but there is no proof as to the date of his father’s death. Ilis mother died in 1869. H. Corzine’s wife was dead August 8, 1888,. but the date of her death is not shown by the evidence. His only brother is S. S. Corzine, and his sisters were N. A. Lockhart, Elizabeth White,. S. J. Saulsbury. and Mary Green. Intervenor Elizabeth White was married to Thomas A. White in March, 1854, and he died in 1884. N. A. and L. G. Lockhart were married in 1846, since which time N. A. Lock-hart has been a married woman.
W. E. D. Ward, the patentee of the land in controversy, died in 1868. Virgil Ward, the father of plaintiff, was one of the children of W. E. D. .Ward, who had five children in all. Virgil Ward died September 21, 1864. Virgil Ward had one child, the plaintiff in this suit, who was born September 29, 1864.
Administration was opened on the estate of W. E. D. Ward in Harrison County, in 1868, and A. G. Ward and A. G. Turney were duly appointed administrators of his estate, and were duly qualified as such.
Upon the application of A. G. Ward, one of the administrators, the Probate Court of Harrison County, at its January Term, 1877, appointed commissioners to partition the lands belonging to W. E. D. Ward’s estate, who reported to the following March Term of said court that the land in controversy, together with other lands of said estate, was not susceptible of partition, and the court thereupon ordered a sale of the same. The land in controversy was sold by the administrator to T. C. Haggart, as guardian of the person and estate of plaintiff, and the sale reported to the court, and the court duly approved said sale at the May Term, 1877.
The said administrators executed and delivered the original deed to T. C. Haggart, as guardian of plaintiff’s estate, to the land in controversy, introduced in evidence, in pursuance of said order of court. A part of the purchase price for said land was paid in cash out of the estate of plaintiff, and T. C. Haggart, describing himself as guardian of the person and estate of said minor, executed a note for the balance of the purchase money, payable to said administrators, who brought suit upon said note, and to foreclose the vendor’s lien, in the District Court of Archer County, in October, 1881, joining with said I-Iaggart the plaintiff herein as defendant therein. In that suit Haggart answered as guardian of plaintiff, December. 12, 1881. Plaintiff did not answer, and the judgment introduced in evidence was rendered April 17, 1882. This judgment was for $395.35, and foreclosed the vendor’s lien on all the land in controversy. Sale was made under the order of sale issued upon said judgment introduced in evidence, on the-day of June, 1882, to Perry Webster, for the sum of $427.42. At the date of the institution of said suit the plaintiff herein was a minor, and guardianship was pending on his estate in the Probate Court of Galveston County, and Fannie A. Haggart was the guardian of his person and estate, duly appointed by said court, and T. C. Haggart was not then, and was not at any time, the guardian of the person or estate of plaintiff. T. C. Haggart had been the husband of Fannie A. Haggart, but had been divorced before the institution of said suit.
The land in controversy at the date of sale was worth $6000. ■ Perry Webster and Anna Webster transferred the land in controversy to John H. Stone for $3109.50, with covenant of warranty of title only as to Perry Webster, by deed dated July 22, 1882.
John H. Stone transferred the land in controversy to the Wichita Land and Cattle Company by deed dated August 14, 1882.
Defendant Wichita Land and Cattle Company went into possession of the land in controversy in August, 1882, and has remained in possession, using and occupying the same, ever since.
The amount of the lien on the land in controversy paid off and discharged by Perry Webster at the date of his purchase at sheriff’s sale is $427.42, which, with interest to date, amounts to the sum of $658.14, and the value of the use and occupancy by the defendant Of the land in controversy since two years before the institution of suit is $658.14.
Defendant claims title to the land in controversy under administrators’ deed of A. G. Ward and A. G. Turney, and under sheriff’s deed introduced in evidence.
The intervenors, N. A. Lockhart and Elizabeth White, claim as heirs of Herschel Corzine. It will be seen from the conclusions of fact that the certificate was issued to F. M. Weatherred as assignee of Corzine, on the 23d of April, 1853, thereby placing the legal title thereto in him. The ¡latent to the land in controversy was issued to Ward, assignee of Corzine, on May 10, 1855, thereby placing the legal title to this particular tract of land in Ward on that date. Looking to the face of the papers alone, it is therefore plain that the claim of these intervenors was a stale demand long before the filing of their plea of intervention. Wimberly v. Pabst, 55 Texas, 591; League v. Rogan, 59 Texas, 427; Montgomery v. Noyes, 73 Texas, 204. The intervenors, however, undertake to excuse this long delay in the assertion of their equitable claim, by showing that Mrs. Lockhart has been a feme covert since 1846, and that Mrs. White was a feme covert from March, 1854, to 1884, and that they were ignorant of this land being claimed by any one as the assignee of Cor-zine; also, that Archer County, where the land was situated, was a wild, uninhabited region, and that from 1874 to 1879 it was not attached to any county for judicial purposes, and there was no place where suit could be brought; and no actual possession adverse to intervenors’ was had until 1883. Intervenors filed their plea of intervention on the 29th of August, 1887, and their cause of action appearing on its face to be stale, the burden was upon them to allege and prove the facts that would excuse the delay. Hillebrant v. Brewer, 6 Texas, 51.
In this case it is made to appear that Corzine’s mother did not die until 1869, and the only evidence as to the date of his father’s death is that he was dead on the 8th of August, 1888. It is therefore not shown that both of his parents were not living at the date of the issuance of the patent to Ward as assignee in 1855; and inasmuch as intervenors were only sisters of Corzine, they inherited nothing from him, and only became entitled to an interest in the land upon the death of one of their parents. Whether the inheritance from Corzine be governed by the law of 1840, in force at the time of his death, or by that of 1848, in force at the time the certificate was granted, brothers and sisters inherited nothing if both parents were living. It will therefore be seen that the cause of action accrued to the parents of Corzine during their lifetime; and in analogy to the statute of limitation, which prohibits the tacking of disabilities, and continues to run after it has once commenced, notwithstanding intervening disabilities, we are of opinion that upon their death laches did not cease to be imputed to intervenors by reason of their coverture, and that therefore the claims of both of them should be considered stale demands, even if we exclude from our consideration the time during which the statute of limitation was suspended by law, and also the time intervening between 1874 and 1879, during which it is alleged that Archer County was not attached to any other county for judicial purposes. McDonald v. McGuire, 8 Texas, 365; White v. Latimer, 12 Texas, 61; Hunton v. Nichols, 55 Texas, 230. It will therefore be unnecessary for us to consider the question as to whether or not the special act certificate was properly issued to Weatherred as assignee of Cor-zine under the act of 1853.
From an inspection of the pleadings in this case it will be seen that the principal object of this suit is to annul a judgment rendered in the District Court of Archer County at its April Term, 1882, in favor of A. G. Ward and A. G-. Turney, administrators of W. R. D. Ward, deceased, against T. C. Haggart and appellee Y. S. J. Ward, for the sum of $395.35, and foreclosing the vendor’s lien upon the land in controversy. The grounds relied upon by appellee for annulling this judgment are, in effect, that it was obtained by fraud; that at the time of its rendition appellee was a minor only about 17 years of age, and no guardian ad litem was appointed by the court to represent his interests; that Thos. C. Haggart, though sued as his guardian, was not in fact then and has never been such guardian; that at the sale under this judgment the sum realized was a grossly inadequate consideration for the land. Appellee asks that for these reasons the judgment be declared absolutely null and void; but in the alternative prays that it, with the sale thereunder, be set aside, and offers to account for the amount paid by the purchaser at said sale.
In this suit T. C. Haggart is not made a party, and the first assignment of error by appellant complains of the action of the court in overruling its special exception to appellee’s petition for this omission, and we have had great difficulty in arriving at a satisfactory conclusion as to whether or not Haggart is-a necessary party in the suit to vacate the judgment rendered against him as above set forth.
It is not to be denied that in a suit to review or annul a judgment all of the parties to such judgment, or their privies, are necessary parties. York v. Cartwright, 42 Texas, 136; Williams v. Nolan, 58 Texas, 712; Slaughter v. Owens, 60 Texas, 671.
In a case, however, where the owner of a judgment has assigned or transferred it he ceases to be a necessary party, and his assignee must be sued in his stead (Hudson v. Morriss, 55 Texas, 604); and in case one of the parties to the judgment be dead, his heirs or legal representatives are made parties in his stead. And so we think in this case, the judgment being against Haggart only in his representative capacity as guardian of the appellee V. S. J. Ward, when such minor became of age Haggart ceased to have any further interest in the judgment, and appellee was properly considered as his representative in this suit. It was appellee’s land that was sold for the payment of this judgment, and upon his arrival at majority he alone was interested in setting aside this sale, and we are therefore of opinion that the court did not err in holding that Haggart was not a necessary party. Jones v. Smith, 55 Texas, 383.
Upon the trial in the court below the deed from A. G-. Ward and A. G-. Turney, administrators of W. R. D. Ward, deceased, to T. C. Haggart, guardian of the person and estate of V. S. J. Ward, was admitted in evidence over the objection of appellant, that it was not properly registered, and its execution had not been proven. Appellant had, however, previous to the trial, been required by appellee to file an abstract of its title under our statute, and in this abstract it had given this deed as one of the links in its chain of title, and had filed a certified copy of it with the papers; and this abstract and copy were admitted in evidence, also over the objection of appellant, to prove that the parties hereto claimed under this deed as a common source of title. It seems to have been held in Evans v. Foster, 79 Texas, 50, that this abstract was properly admitted for this purpose, and it will therefore be unnecessary for us to decide as to whether or not the execution of the deed was sufficiently proven to authorize its admission in the first instance.
Appellant in his petition first seeks to have the judgment against him declared an absolute nullity, but he also prays, in case the,court decides it necessary for him to refund to appellant the amount paid by the purchaser at the sale thereunder, that the use of the land while in the possession of appellant be allowed as an offset against this amount, and this was the relief granted by the court. As we are of opinion that the petition of appellee showed good equitable grounds for having this judgment and sale set aside, it will not be necessary for us to pass upon the question as to whether or not the judgment against him during his minority, while guardianship was pending, without making his regular guardian a party, was void or only voidable. If he had been without a guardian, the failure to appoint a guardian ad litem would seem to be only an irregularity that would render the judgment voidable, but not void. Montgomery v. Carlton, 56 Texas, 431; McAnear v. Epperson, 54 Texas, 224. In Elston v. Jasper, 45 Texas, 409, however, it is decided that an insane person, while actually under legal subsisting guardianship, and in support of the guardian’s authority, is conclusively pz’esumed iizcapable to contract, and his deed, as against his guardian, is absolutely void. As to whether this would be so in the case of a minor under legal and subsisting guardianship, sued without making liis guardian a party, we shall not undertake to decide. Denni v. Elliott, 60 Texas, 339. But we are of opiniozi that such irregularity, coupled with the fact that no guardian ad litem was appointed to represent the interests of the minor izi the litigation as required by law, and that no answer was filed for him, and that under such judgment his land, worth §6000, was sold for §427.42, presents such aiz equitable case as authorized the court, at the suit of the minor, instituted within a reasonable time after arriving at his majority, to set aside such proceedings and restore the land to him.
We think the eouz-t properly allowed the rents and profits of the land to be an offset against the amount paid by the purchaser at the sale under the judgment. Patrick v. Roach, 21 Texas, 251.
We are not called upozz to decide whether or not the court, under the ciz-cumstances of this case, applied the pz’oper measure of recovery in behalf of appellant against its warrantor, Webster, no errors having been assigned to this part of the judgment.
Delivered November 15, 1892.
Upon the whole case we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be in all things affirmed, and it is so ordered.
Affirmed."
219144,Galveston Rope and Twine Company v. Mary Burkett,1893-02-23,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
The first assignment of error is, that the court erred in overruling the exception to the petition, because of its omission to allege that appellant knew, or by the use of ordinary care could have- known, of the incompetency of the servant from whose negligence it is alleged that appellee’s injury resulted. The petition alleged, that the act of employing a servant was done in a careless and negligent manner, and that in consequence thereof an incompetent servant was taken into appellant’s service. This was not an abstract allegation that appellant was guilty of negligence, but a specification of the act complained of and charged to have been done in a negligent manner. This, we think, was sufficient. To have alleged that appellant knew, or could have known, of the incompetency of the employe, would have been only a further definition of the negligence charged against it, and would have been a repetition, in other language, of what was involved in the averments made.
The second special exception, of the overruling of which appellant complains in its second assignment of error, was based on the absence of an allegation that appellee, while working with the fellow servant, did not know of her unfitness. The question, whether or not one suing to recover damages resulting from the negligence of another must allege and prove the exercise of proper care on his own part, has been discussed in many of the decisions of the Supreme Court. The general rule has been settled in this State, that a plaintiff is not required to negative the assumption of contributory negligence on his own part, unless the facts stated in developing his case expose him to suspicion of its existence, in which event he must clear himself.
In Railway v. Cowser, 57 Texas, 293, this principle was applied in a suit for the death of a servant caused by the negligence of his employer. But in Railway v. Crowder, 63 Texas, 502, the rule applicable to such cases was stated to be, that when the servant sues the master for the negligence of the latter, the burden is upon the plaintiff to show that he was not guilty of negligence contributing to his injury, and authorities are cited sustaining that proposition.
In Murray v. Railway, 73 Texas., 2, the opinion in the Crowder case is limited to the peculiar facts of that case, which is treated as one of the exceptional instances in which the facts shown in developing the cause of the servant’s death raised the question of contributory negligence and threw upon the plaintiff the burden of removing the suspicion attaching to his conduct. That decision is construed in the same way in Brown v. Sullivan, 71 Texas, 475.
In Railway v. Bennett, 76 Texas, 155, which was a suit to recover for the death of a servant caused by the negligence of the master, it is said: “ We think it is now well settled, that unless the plaintiff’s case discloses want of care on the part of the injured party, or exposes him to suspicion of negligence, and the defendant relies upon the defense of contributory negligence, it must be pleaded and proved. It is only when the averments of the petition show a prima facie case of negligence on the part of the injured party, that it becomes necessary that the plaintiff should negative by averment and proof the existence of such negligence. ’ ’
It thus appears that the same rule applies in cases of servants suing as governs suits by other persons, and that in neither is the plaintiff required to anticipate and negative a charge of contributory negligence on his part, when the facts which he states do not suggest that he may have been guilty of it.
The same principle applies to the question before us. If the servant, in his petition, is not required to show that the injury of which he complains was not partly the result of his own negligence, he should not be required to allege that he had not assumed the risk resulting to him by negligence of the master. The law imposes upon the master the duty of using ordinary prudence in selecting servants, and makes him liable if one of his servants receives injury because of his negligence in the performance of such duty. The risks resulting from such negligence of the master are not impliedly assumed by the servant in the contract of hiring. When he shows that the master has violated the obligation resting upon him, by negligently employing to work with him an incompetent person, through whose incompetency he has been hurt, he makes a prima facie case. If he knows of the incompetency of his coemploye before he was hurt and continues to work with him, he thereby assumes the risk, and this would afford a defense which the master might allege and prove. But it should not be presumed that the servant knew of the incompetency of his fellow, and he should not therefore be required to allege that he did not know it. The exception was properly overruled.
We think the court erred in assuming in its charge, that the fellow servant of appellee was incompetent, and in refusing the special charge asked by appellant submitting that question to the jury. While the evidence is uncontradicted, that the fellow servant, when first employed, was inexperienced and unskilled in the work to which she was put, and would have justified the jury in concluding that she continued so up to the time when plaintiff was hurt, yet such was the character of the work that the jury should have been left to determine from all of the evidence whether or not she was incompetent at the time the accident happened, so as to make it negligent, under the circumstances, for appellant to allow her to do the work. The question of competency must depend largely upon the nature of the work provided for the servant to do, and upon the danger to be apprehended and avoided in performing it.
There was error also in refusing to charge, that if plaintiff with ordinary care would have known of the incompetency of the coemploye, she could not recover. This instruction was made proper by the evidence in the case, and the charge given did not contain it.
There was no error in allowing the plaintiff to testify that the machine was not handled properly and skillfully by Miss Malcolm when plaintiff was hurt. The witness showed' that she was qualified to speak as an expert, and explained the manner in which the work should have been done. There can be no question that the act in question was improperly done, and even if the opinion of the witness had been incompetent, no injury resulted. The other assignments are not well taken.
The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.
jReversed and remanded.

219253,Joseph Sonka v. R. K. Chatham & Co.,1893-02-23,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
On the 24th day of February, 1890, appellant, who resided at Seguin, entered into a written contract with appellees, whose place of business was Bryan, by which he agreed to buy from them certain machinery, to be delivered on or about the 1st day of April, 1890, free on board cars at Seguin. The price agreed on was $3300, which appellant agreed to pay in two installments, on May 15 and December 1, 1890. It was stipulated that the title to the property should remain in appellees until the purchase money was paid, and that in default of payment, appellees should have the right to take the property and sell it for payment of the purchase money, expenses, etc.
Appellant discovered that he had made a mistake as to the character of machine needed by him, and on February 26, 1890, telegraphed appellees. “ Hold order until I write; a change is desired.” On March 5, 1890, he wrote to appellees, indicating the desired change; and the latter replied on March 7, stating that the machinery had been ordered for appellant, but that the proposed changes would not affect them in any great degree, and requesting appellant to meet their agent, A. M. Rhodes, at San Antonio, on the next Monday night, when they were satisfied satisfactory arrangements could be made. Appellant did not go to San Antonio, but on March 11, Rhodes met him in Seguin, and an interview took place, about which there is a conflict of evidence, appellant claiming that the original contract was abandoned by agreement, and a new one substituted, and Rhodes testifjdng that no new agreement was reached, and that the order stood as first made.
March 14, appellees wrote appellant, suggesting that part of the machinery specified in the order, and which appellees would have to purchase from other manufacturers, be changed, and articles of the same character manufactured by them be substituted, adding, “ Tour complete outfit with this exception has been ordered long since and will be shipped promptly.’ ’
March 15,1890, appellant wired appellees, “ Do not order any machinery for me now; I cancelled first order with consent of Rhodes.” Appellees replied by letter of date March 17, 1890, stating that they had received no second order, and had not allowed appellant to cancel the first, and that they had long since ordered the goods, and would have them shipped promptly, etc.
Appellees caused the machinery to be shipped to appellant at Seguin, free on board the cars, most of it arriving by the 10th of April, 1890. The appellant refused to accept the machinery; and appellees, through their agent at Seguin, sold it, according to the terms of the original order, treating the property as that of appellant. The machinery was bought in by appellees for the sum of $1000, which was credited on the original order.
This is an action by appellees, against appellant, to recover a judgment for the value of the machinery, less $1000, the amount for which it sold at public auction, after deducting attorney fees and costs of sale.
The appellant answered by admitting the original order to have been given, but set up that said order liad been cancelled and an amended order given; and that the original order was repudiated on the 15th day of March, 1890, long before said machinery had been shipped him, and before some of it had been manufactured by the appellees or by their order; and that if appellees had any cause of action against him, it was a suit for damages on an alleged violation of contract, and not a suit for debt. The case was tried by the court without a jury, and the appellees recovered judgment against the appellant for the sum of §2815 and interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum; from which judgment the appellant appeals.
It was shown during the trial, that appellees had some of the articles in stock at Bryan, but that the larger part of it was purchased from other manufacturers at various places, and that the orders for it had been forwarded long before the receipt by appellees of appellant’s message of March 15.
There was no evidence, however, that the shipment of any of it had been commenced before that time, the bills of lading being all dated about the 1st of April.
The telegram of March 15 was a distinct repudiation of the contract by appellant. The rules of law defining the rights of a seller against the purchaser, when the latter first breaks the contract by refusing to take goods when tendered at the time and place of delivery, do not apply. Tufts v. Lawrence, 77 Texas, 526; Gammage v. Alexander, 14 Texas, 419; 2 Suth. on Dam., 361.
According to the rules laid down in these authorities, appellees should not have shipped the goods to Seguin, and thereby subjected appellant to increased damages, but should have stopped performance as far as they could reasonably do so, and then have held him liable for such damages as resulted to them.
In Tufts v. Lawrence, 77 Texas, 526, a case similar to this, the measure of damages is said to be the “ difference between the contract price and the value of the goods in the condition they were in when he received the notice [of repudiation] at the place of their manufacture.” There it appeared that the property was to be delivered to the purchaser at the place of manufacture. Here the machinery was to be delivered at Seguin, and appellees would have had to incur the cost of shipment to that point before their right to the contract price could have arisen. The measure prescribed in the case referred to would therefore, if applied to this case, include a profit which appellees would not have realized had the contract been carried out. On the other hand, appellees may have become bound to other parties to pay for the larger part of the machinery before receiving notice of the repudiation of the contract. They could not be required to violate their contracts with others, but had the right to complete them and pay for the goods purchased.
They might thus have been left with a large lot of machinery on hand, at different places, selected to fill this particular order, which they could not have disposed of without loss to themselves. This they should not be required to bear. The only effect of the repudiation by appellant of the contract was to impose upon them “ the duty to reasonably conduct their affairs so as to lessen the damages.” And appellant will be relieved from liability only to the extent that damages could thus have been avoided. 2 Suth., 361.
The measure of damages must, we think, depend on the facts which, may be shown on another trial. In any event, appellees will be entitled to have the contract price taken as the standard by which to determine their loss. From this should be deducted the market value at Bryan of such of the goods as appellees had in stock there, and the cost of shipping-them to Seguin.
There should be deducted such further sums as the machinery purchased by appellees cost them, unless it should appear that they could not have disposed of it for as much as they paid for it, in which event the amount they could reasonably have realized from it, had they not shipped it to Seguin, should be deducted; also the cost of shipping it to Seguin. The difference between the amount thus to be deducted and the contract price-is what appellees will be entitled to recover.
What we have said is, of course, upon the assumption that there was not a rescission of the contract by consent, and that the rights of the parties are made to depend upon the repudiation of it by appellant, by his-telegram of March 15, 1890.
The facts were not developed in the court below with reference to the measure of damages, as we define it, and we can not render a judgment which would probably reach the justice of the case, and it will therefore be reversed and remanded.

Delivered February 23, 1893."
216205,Schneider & Davis et al. v. T. B. Campbell,1892-11-15,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
The record in this cause is submitted on conclusions of law and fact and a statement of facts filed in the court below. Only one question is raised, to-wit, Was the property in controversy the homestead of appellee at the date of appellants’ levy ?
The conclusions of fact filed by the trial court are sustained by the statement of facts; we therefore adopt them as our conclusions of fact. We also concur in the conclusions of law deduced therefrom.
Appellee, the head of a family, established his home prior to the levy upon a portion of a block of land 200 feet square, in a village of about 200 inhabitants. The block was subdivided into lots, but without any streets or alleys separating them. Upon a portion of these lots was the residence of the family, which was also used as a hotel. Upon adjacent lots of the same block appellee, with one Martin as his partner, was engaged in keeping a livery stable, at which was kept his own horses and those of his hotel guests, and under an adjacent shelter his family buggy. He also had his cow lots and pig pens on the livery stable lots.
The principal contention of appellants seems to be, that the domestic use made of the livery stable lots was merely incidental; that the keeping of a livery stable thereon was the principal use, and imposed on these lots a business rather than a residence character; and that as appellee was engaged in the hotel business he could not also claim the exemption of lots used in the livery business.
Delivered November 15, 1892.
The Constitution exempts not only “ a lot” but “lots” as a place to exercise the calling or business of the head of a family, and does not restrict this calling or business to any single branch or department. We perceive no reason why adjacent lots should not be exempt, under the Constitution, as a place to carry on the hotel and livery business, if such be the business of the head of the family. The cases cited by appellants seem to us not to be in conflict with the view here expressed.
The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.
Affirmed."
216234,Laura F. Morgan v. Susan H. Morgan et al.,1892-11-15,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
Appellee Susan II. Morgan and John E. Morgan were married in the State of Missouri in the year 1848, and removed to Parker County, in this State, in 1859, where they resided until the death of said John E. Morgan, in November, 1887. In 1870, however, they ceased to live together as husband and wife, and continued to live separately and apart from each other from that time. In 1876 the said John E. Morgan, after having been refused a divorce in this State, and without ever having become a citizen of Utah Territory, and without ever having acquired a domicile therein, obtained a decree of divorce from his said wife, in the Probate Court of Salt Lake County. In said last named suit for divorce the said Susan H. Morgan filed a plea to the jurisdiction of said court, she being at the time a citizen of this State, and never at any time having been in, or acquired a domicile in, said Utah Territory. After having obtained the Utah divorce as above set forth, in the fall of 1876 the said John E. Morgan and appellant, Laura F. Morgan, were married in Tarrant County in this State. At the time of this last marriage the said John E. Morgan owned 160 acres of land, which is a part of the property in controversy herein, and after such marriage he and appellant accumulated the remainder of the property in controversy, or at least a large part thereof. The cause was submitted in the court below to the jury upon special issues, and upon their verdict judgment was rendered declaring the Utah divorce to be a nullity, and adjudging all the property in controversy to the lawful wife, Susan H. Morgan, and appellee W. B. Morgan, who was the only child of said John E., and from this judgment this appeal is prosecuted.
Appellant’s seventh assignment of error calls in question the action of the court in admitting evidence as to the actual residence of J. E. Morgan in this State, for the purpose of attacking the decree of divorce rendered in Utah, the contention being that the judgment of a sister State or Territory can not be attacked collaterally. That such judgment can be collaterally attacked in this State by showing that the court which rendered it was without jurisdiction, is too well settled to require discussion. Chunn v. Gray, 51 Texas, 114; Redus v. Burnett, 59 Texas, 581; Norwood v. Cobb, 24 Texas, 554. We are also of opinion that the court did not err in holding the Utah divorce to be an absolute nullity. The verdict of the jury established that John E. Morgan was never at any time a citizen of Utah Territory, and never at any time, either before or after the granting of the decree, acquired a domicile therein. Without undertaking to discuss the reasons upon which the decisions are based, we think it will be found that an almost unbroken line of decisions in the different States establishes the invalidity of a decree of divorce where neither of the parties are domiciled in the country granting the decree. 2 Black on Judg., 927; 2 Freem. on Judg., 580.
The court below, proceeding upon the idea that if the Utah divorce was a nullity the second marriage of John E. Morgan would also be a nullity, and would deprive the appellant, Laura F. Morgan, of all interest in the property acquired while she was living with him under such marriage, refused to admit evidence that the said Laura F. entered into this marriage in good faith, believing that the said John E. Morgan had been legally divorced from his former wife; and also refused evidence that the said Laura F., by her prudent management and services, contributed to the acquisition of the property in question, believing herself to be a lawful wife; and in entering its decree adjudged that she was not entitled to any part of such property; and the correctness of this action of the court presents the most serious question for our consideration.
The status of property acquired by a man and woman living together as husband and wife without having been lawfully married has been the subject of doubt and litigation almost from the time Texas became an independent republic. At an early day it was settled that where a headlight certificate was issued to a man thus situated, as the head of a family, the woman was entitled to a one-half interest therein, notwithstanding the man had a lawful wife and family in another State, and the woman knew this fact. In other words, the fact that the woman was living in open adultery with the man did not deprive her of the right to claim a community interest in the certificate granted in his name or to his heirs. Babb v. Carroll, 21 Texas, 766; Lewis v. Ames, 44 Texas, 345; Yates v. Houston, 3 Texas, 433.
But the direct question involved in this controversy, so far as we are aware, has never been authoritatively settled in this State, although frequent allusions have been made to it. In Carroll v. Carroll, 20 Texas, 743, Chief Justice Hemphill uses this language: “ I have not considered the strong claim which the defendant, Susan, independently of her rights as a lawful wife, might have urged to a community share of the property. She was his wife de facto. -By her labors and toils she contributed to the accumulation of, the estate. At the time of their marriage they were in a state of indigence, their property not amounting to more than $150. Their gains were the result of their joint industry, thrift, and economy, and she is reasonably entitled to a share of the proceeds.”
In Zimpelman v. Robb, 53 Texas, 283, the question was alluded to as not being necessary to be decided.
In Routh v. Routh, 57 Texas, 600, in the opinion adopted by the court the question is expressly waived as not being necessary for its decision, but in the separate opinion of Associate Justice Bonner, on page 602, he uses the following language: “ I am of the opinion that under the facts and circumstances of this case Nancy Thompson, in right of her putative marriage with Jonathan Routh, was entitled to one-half of the property acquired during that marriage, in the nature of a partnership of acquests and gains. I am am further of the opinion, that only the remainder of the property of that marriage, or one-half of the whole, could constitute the net community property of Jonathan Routh and his legal wife, Elizabeth Routh, plaintiff below, and that all to which the latter should in any event be entitled would be one-fourth the whole or one-half the net community property of herself and Jonathan Routh:” and cites Clendenning v. Clendenning, 3 La. (N. S.), 438; Succession of Navarro, 24 La. Ann., 297; Harrington v. Barfield, 30 La. Ann., part 2, 1297; Gaines v. Hennen, 24 How., 553; Gaines v. New Orleans, 6 Wall., 642; Smith v. Smith, 1 Texas, 621; Lee v. Smith, 18 Texas, 141; Henderson v. Ryan, 27 Texas, 670.
It will thus be seen that the strong tendency of our judges in the past has been to hold that property acquired in this State, under our community laws, by a man and woman living together as husband and wife, should belong to them in equal shares, whether they were legally married or not. And why should this not be so, especially when they have attempted to enter into a marriage contract, and believed that they were lawfully husband and wife ? In such cases, by attempting to enter into the marriage contract, they agreed, as far as they had the power to agree, that they would live together as husband and wife, and that all property that they might thereafter acquire should be community property, and belong to them in equal portions. Such is the meaning of the contract they attempted to make under our law. How, then, can it be said that the property acquired in pursuance of such a contract shall belong to one of the parties more than the other ? What right has the husband to all of the property, to the exclusion of the wife, or what right has the wife to all of the property, to the exclusion of the husband ? Suppose a wife so situated should by her own exertions acquire property toward which the husband did not contribute anything, would it be contended that this property became his property? How, then, can it be that where the property is acquired by the joint labors of both, each in the eye of the law contributing one-half thereto, it shall belong only to the husband ?
It will not do to refer to the decisions in common law States to sustain the proposition that the woman under such circumstances has no right to any part of the property so acquired. In those States, by entering into the marriage contract she understood that all the property they might acquire while living together should belong to the husband, but in this State she understood that their rights in the property they might accumulate should be equal.
If it be .undertaken to sustain the view that the husband is entitled to everything, upon the ground that he has possession, or that the titles have been taken in his name, and that under the circumstances indicated the courts will not lend their aid to either party, but will leave them where it finds them in reference to their property rights, then why should the court lend its aid to recover from appellant the property alleged to be in her possession, especially the personal property ?
If we undertake to apply to the parties in this case the principles of law applicable to persons engaged in an illegal contract, it would seem that under the decisions in this State, the appellant, Laura F. Morgan, would be entitled to one-half of the property made by the partnership of which she and John E. Morgan were the members. By the decision in De Leon v. Trevino, 49 Texas, 92, approved in Pfeuffer v. Maltby, 54 Texas, 461, and in Wegner Bros. v. Biering & Co., 65 Texas, 511, it seems to be established as the law of this State, that although the partnership may be engaged in an illegal traffic, yet when the contract has been executed without the aid of the court by the voluntary acts of the parties, the profit that is realized is not contaminated, and the partners can force a division thereof; and this seems also to be the view entertained by the Supreme Court of the United States. Brooks v. Martin, 2 Wall., 70; Bank v. Bank, 16 Wall., 483; McBlair v. Gibbs, 17 How., 232.
Applying these principles to the case at bar, if it be conceded that the relations of John E. Morgan and appellant were illegal, and that their contract to live together and divide the property they might accumulate would not sustain an action in behalf of either if brought thereon, still we believe it can not be said that after the contract has been voluntarily executed by both, and the property has been acquired, the courts will refuse to recognize their respective interests therein.
But the evidence excluded by the court, if admitted, would have made a stronger case than the one we have considered. Appellant proposed to prove that she entered into the marriage contract with John E. Morgan in good faith, believing he had a legal divorce from his former wife, he having represented to her that this was the case. Her mistake then was one of fact. But even if it had been shown that she was apprised of all the circumstances of the divorce, while she may have been charged with a knowledge of the law that would render it a nullity, yet her mistake was one that almost any person not versed in the law would be liable to make. The court in Utah had declared it to be a legal divorce, and appellant, without any great degree of negligence, might have accepted this as conclusive, especially when its legality depended upon the ascertainment of facts, which it was the duty of the court to ascertain before granting the decree. We are of the opinion, therefore, that if appellant in good faith believed that she was the lawful wife of John E. Morgan, she should not be deprived of her right to participate in the property acquired through their joint efforts, and that she should have been allowed to prove that fact, and that this issue should have been submitted to the jury.
Delivered November 15, 1892.
Of course this would give appellant no right to any share in the prop-, erty which John E. Morgan had at the time of his attempted marriage to her, whether such property be his separate property or the community property of him and his first wife. This by our statute would go to his lawful wife and child. Newland v. Holland, 45 Texas, 588. We are therefore relieved of the necessity of discussing the effect of the separation contract attempted to be entered into between John E. Morgan and his wife Susan H. Morgan. Should this become necessary in the further progress of this litigation, the law applicable to such contracts will be found very fully considered in Rains v. Wheeler, 76 Texas, 394; also alluded to in James v. James, 81 Texas, 378.
The action of the court in submitting this case upon special issues we think in compliance with our statutes (1 Sayles’ Civil Statutes, art. 1333), and appellant’s assignments of error challenging this practice are not well taken.
The description of the property and the answers of the jury to the special issues are so indefinite, and the changes that have occurred in the property since the trial of this cause in the court below are probably so extensive, that we think it is best to reverse and remand the cause for a new trial in accordance with this opinion, rather than to undertake to render here such judgment as the court below ought to have rendered; and it is so ordered.
Reversed and remanded."
219241,Jerry Robinson v. John M. Jones,1893-02-23,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
This suit was brought by Jerry Robinson against John M. Jones, for the recovery of an undivided one-third interest in a number of lots of land on Galveston Island.
The defense is outstanding title and limitation. Plaintiff showed title as follows:
1. Patent by the State of Texas to Edward Hall and Levi Jones.
2. Power of attorney from Edward Hall to William Bryan.
3. Deed from Edward Hall, by William Bryan, attorney in fact, to John M. Jones and Henry Hubbell, dated October 9, 1847.
4. Deed from John M. Jones and Henry Hubbell to Edward Hall for an undivided one-third interest in the land, dated October 13, 1847.
5. Will of Edward Hall, devising the land to his wife, Eliza Ann.
6. Deed from Eliza Ann Hall, widow of Edward Hall, to John McDougal, dated October 1, 1885=
7. Deed from John McDougal to the plaintiff, Jerry Robinson, dated September 18, 1890.
The defendant put in evidence a deed dated October 9, 1867, from Edward Hall to Henry B. Andrews, John M. Jones, and the estate of Lorin Kent, deceased, wherein he conveyed, “in addition to the property conveyed to them by deed bearing date November 20,1866, all legal and equitable rights and privileges and titles to any and all locations made by me on Galveston Island, Texas, either individually or in connection with others.”
He further offered in evidence.
1. The deed of Edward Hall, by Bryan, attorney in fact, to John M. Jones and Henry Hubbell, above recited, which shaw's that it was recorded in the record of deeds for Galveston County, October 19, 1847, and recited a consideration of 8800 and other considerations.
2. Proceedings in cause number 441, M. B. Menard v. John M. Jones, Henry Hubbell, and Edward Hall, to foreclose mortgage for the purchase money notes given by Jones and Hubbell for the land. No service was had on Hall, and the suit was dismissed as to him. There was judgment and foreclosure as to Jones and Hubbell.
3. Execution and return of sale in said cause, showing sale of property to the plaintiff, M. B. Menard, on the first Tuesday in March, 1850.
4. Deed of M. B. Menard to John M. Jones and Henry Hubbell, dated June 13, 1850, recorded October 28, 1851, releasing and quitclaiming the land to Jones and Hubbell.
5. Henry Hubbell died in 1853, and his estate was regularly administered in Galveston Count)'. A half-interest in the property described in the deed from Hall, by Bryan as attorney in fact, to Jones and Hubbell was inventoried among the assets of the estate, and was duly sold by the administrator and purchased by the defendant, John M. Jones, who received a deed therefor, which was recorded in Galveston County in 1855.
The evidence also showed, that the land patented to Edward Hall and Levi Jones had been partitioned between them, and that other persons, viz., John C. Watrous, R. C. Franklin, and William Bryan, were interested with Hall in his half-interest in the land, although the legal title was in him. There was a partition of the interest set apart to Hall between him and those interested with him, except as to the several bayous and portions of the land covered with water included within the bounds of the patent to Levi Jones and Edward Hall, and the several sections assigned to Edward Hall which were declared by the decree of partition to be the common property of Hall, Bryan, Watrous, and Franklin. From certain papers attached to the decree of partition, read in evidence, it appeared that Hall, for himself and as attorney for Bryan, had made application to the surveyor of Galveston County for a survey of all the public domain of Galveston Island; and also for the location of certain land scrip on the shoals and reefs in front of and adjoining the city of Galveston.
In submitting the deed from Edward Hall to H. B. Andrews, John M. Jones, and the estate of Lorin Kent, to the jury, the court charged them as follows: “As to the said instrument of writing of date October 9, 1867, and filed for record August, 1872, it is ambiguous as to the word 1 locations;’ the language of the said instrument is, that he ‘ do bargain, sell, and convey to the parties above named, in addition to the property conveyed to them by deed bearing date November 20, 1866, all legal and equitable rights and privileges and titles to any and all locations made by me on Galveston Island, Texas, either individually or in connection with others.’ The ambiguity arises from the word ‘locations,’ used in said instrument. If you believe from the evidence that Hall, by himself, or with others or another, had made locations on Galveston Island not embracing the land in controversy, which land in controversy was then patented, you must determine from the evidence whether the word ‘ locations ’ embraced the patented land in controversy, or only embraced the locations not embraced in the land in controversy; for if you believe from the evidence that the word ‘ locations ’ used in said instrument only embraced the said other locations, then the said instrument would not defeat the regular chain of title in the plaintiff Robinson for one undivided third of the property described in the petition.”
The plaintiff has assigned error upon this instruction, because it was the duty of the court to construe the deed for the jury, since there was nothing ambiguous or doubtful as to the terms of the deed with respect to what was undertaken to be conveyed, and no evidence was offered by the defendant to show that the property in controversy was intended to be conveyed by the deed referred to; and there is no evidence to show that either Jones, Kent’s estate, or Andrews ever claimed title to the land under said deed, but that on the contrary the evidence showed that it was claimed by the defendant Jones under title from Edward Hall, deraigned through regular conveyances from October 9, 1847, down to the date of the trial. The admission of the deed in evidence was also objected to by plaintiff’s counsel, because on its face'it did not pass title to the property in controversy from Edward Hall to Jones, Kent, and Andrews, and the deed was not offered for any other purpose; that it had no power or force to pass title to the patented lands that had passed from its locative relation into patent, and out of patent into title, by deed from Edward Hall to others and back to Edward Hall, of the one-third interest in controversy, and not held by right of location, but by due conveyance from private parties, when he executed the deed.
Has the word ‘ ‘ locations ’ ’ a fixed legal meaning, which must control the court in the construction of the deed in question ? The primary signification of the word “ location,” as applied to land, is the land designated by a person when he files a valid land certificate with the proper surveyor and makes an application for the survey of land subject to location by virtue of the certificate. Such person acquires a vested right in the land, and to have the same appropriated to his certificate, surveyed, and finally patented upon proper return of the field notes and otherwise complying with the law. But when the term is used by a person in speaking of locations made by himself, it would ordinarily apply to the land surveyed for him on his application, without any restricted meaning as to whether it was land filed upon, surveyed, or patented. This is the meaning claimed for the term by the appellant. Yet it might be used in a still broader sense by a grantor in conveying lands to designate the same as all “ locations ” made by him, although a part had been conveyed away to others and reconveyed to him, as contradistinguished from lands not located by him, but conveyed to him by others.
Hence we conclude, that the word “ locations,” as used in the deed from Edward Hall to the defendant John M. Jones and others, has no such well defined meaning as would enable the court to construe the instrument without the aid of evidence, and that it was proper to admit evidence to show to what subject matter it applied; and if it should appear from the evidence that the term could be clearly applied to certain lands on Galveston Island, then it should be so applied; but if the application is still left in doubt and can not be made, nothing should pass by the conveyance.
But, as we have seen, the word “ locations ” is directly applicable to the files shown to have been made by Edward Hall for himself and Bryan on all the public domain on Galveston Island, and the shoals and reefs in front of the city, as well as to the patented location on the bayous and land covered by water which had not been partitioned; and such being the case, and there being no evidence tending to show that the land reconveyed to Hall by Jones and Hubbell was intended to be conveyed, it was error to charge the jury, that if they believed from the evidence that , Hall by himself, or in connection with another or others, had made locatians on Galveston Island not embracing the land in controversy, which had been patented, then they should determine from the evidence whether the word “ locations ” embraced the patented land in controversy, or only embraced the locations other than the land in controversy. It would have been proper, in view of the evidence before the jury, to have given the instruction’ requested by plaintiff, that the title to the property in controversy did not pass from Hall by the deed in question.
The deed from Menard to Jones and Hubbell, after the execution sale of the property to him, left the title to the land, as far as it concerned Hall, just as it stood before the foreclosure, as he was not a party to the suit. And as Jones and Hubbell had conveyed the land to Hall with a warranty as against the claims of themselves, the purchase by them from Menard was perfectly consistent with Hall’s title, and does not show any claim by them to the land adverse to the title of Hall to an undivided one-third interest therein. So also, possession of the land and payment of taxes by Jones was not inconsistent with the title of his tenant in common. There is no evidence to show the assertion of an adverse title or possession until the purchase by Jones from the Hubbell estate, and the placing of the administrator’s deed to Jones for the land upon record, which was done in 1855.
The evidence does not show that even five years possession such as Jones could prescribe under was had by him prior to the war. The deeds from Menard to Hubbell and Jones and from Hubbell to Jones were of themselves sufficient to support the five years statute of limitations, on proof of an adverse possession under them and payment of taxes. Even if it should be held that the possession under the Menard deed was adverse, yet it is not shown that Jones’ tenant, Homberg, had possession for five years from the date of its record. In this connection, it may be said, that the fact that the land had been cut up into 10-acre lots would not confine the constructive possession to the particular lot occupied, because the land was conveyed as a whole, and there were no separate claimants of distinct lots. If it should be shown that there was sufficient possession of any part of the land in controversy to put the statute of limitations into effect, such possession would extend by construction to all of the land included in the deeds; unless, however, the defendant Jones should have leased a part of the land including the actual possession, in which event he would have put himself out of the constructive possession of the balance.
Goodrich Jones testified to the payment of taxes, and that in 1881 he had a part of the land fenced in, viz., lots 74, 77, and 88, and that a German was in possession thereof, renting from him; that this tenant stayed there for five years. As to whether or not this was a possession of all the land would depend upon the extent of the lease—whether it was only for the lots named or for the entire tract. There was other evidence as to possession, but not of a satisfactory nature.
The judgment of the court below can not be sustained on the proof in behalf of the plea of limitations, and for the error indicated it will be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.

C. McConnell, as defendants.
One W. C. Powell appeared and made himself a party defendant as warrantor of the said cattle company, and pleaded over against the defendant Isaac McConnell and one Henry Warren as his warrantors.
Warren answered, and pleaded over against the said McConnell as his warrantor.
The defendants claimed under several deeds and written 'instruments, claimed to have been executed by deceased ancestors of plaintiffs, and also under verbal locative contracts claimed to have been made by them; and during the trial the defendant Isaac McConnell was used as a witness to prove the execution of the several instruments above referred to, and also the locative contracts. Plaintiffs objected to this witness testifying, on the ground that he was a party to the suit, and could not testify to transactions with their deceased ancestors,' under our statute. To remedy this objection the said McConnell was permitted, after plaintiffs had closed their evidence, to file a disclaimer of all interest in the land in controversy, and the defendant Powell withdrew his pleading seeking to recover over against the said McConnell as his warrantor; but no order was made with reference to the plea of Henry Warren seeking to recover over against said witness.
After these proceedings McConnell was again permitted to testify to substantially the same facts as in his former testimony, and to prove verbal authority from some of the deceased ancestors of plaintiffs to him to locate the certificate by virtue of which the land was patented, and other land certificates, and to give a part of the land to have this done. Appellants objected to this witness testifying to these facts, upon the same grounds urged to his evidence in the first instance. The court, however, overruled these objections, and a number of appellants’ assignments of error are directed to calling in question the correctness of this ruling.
We are of the opinion the court erred in admitting this evidence. Notwithstanding the disclaimer filed by this witness, and the dismissal by the defendant Powell of his plea over against him, we think it can hardly be questioned that the judgment rendered upon this trial would be conclusive against said McConnell in any subsequent suits that might be brought by those claiming under him to recover upon his covenant of warranty; and especially would it be so conclusive against him in favor of the defendant Warren, who had never dismissed his pleading against him. Brown v. Hearon, 66 Texas, 64; Kirby v. Estill, 75 Texas, 485.
Treating, then, the witness Isaac McConnell as such a party to this suit as would be bound by the judgment rendered therein, so as to fix this liability upon his covenants of warranty, we think there can be but little doubt that he was such a party to the proceeding as would prohibit him, under our statute, from testifying to transactions with the deceased ancestors of plaintiffs, who claimed as their heirs.
Mr. Abbott, in his work on Trial Evidence, page 63, in treating of witnesses who are allowed to testify against executors and administrators, under statutes similar to ours, says: “ No person can be thus examined in his own behalf or interest, or in behalf of a party succeeding to his title or interest, if he or his predecessor in interest is, at the time of the trial, interested in the event of the action or proceeding, whether directly interested in the cause of action, or whether merely liable to be legally affected by the judgment; as, for instance, where he stands in such a position that the effect of a recovery in the action might be to diminish a fund in which he has an interest, or may aid the party unsuccessful in the action to bring and maintain an action against the witness for indemnity.” And again, on page 64: “No person from, through, or under whom such a party or interested person derives his interest or title, by assignment or othewise, can be thus examined in his own behalf or interest, or in behalf of the party succeeding to his title or interest, if the interest or title thus derived is in the particular claim affected by the, transaction or communication.”
Mr. Wharton, in the first volume of his work on the Law of Evidence,, on page 473, in treating of who are parties within the meaning of these statutes, says: “ But a real, who is not a nominal, party to the record is. excluded by the exception.”
In Simpson v. Brotherton, 62 Texas, 170, our Supreme Court, upon full consideration, decided that a wife, by reason of her interest in the community property, was a party to the suit within the meaning of our statute, so as to prohibit her from testifying, although she was not a party to the record; holding that the word “ party ” in this statute was not to be given a narrow construction, but would be extended to include those really in interest, though not parties by name in proceedings; and this was reaffirmed in Newton v. Newton, 77 Texas, 510.
We do not understand the decision in Markham v. Carothers, 47 Texas, 25, and in Eastham v. Roundtree, 56 Texas, 110, to the effect that a defendant who has filed a disclaimer and is thenceforth treated as not being a party to the cause, is a competent witness, as being in conflict with the views here expressed. We therefore hold that where a warrantor has been made a party to the suit in such a way as to render the judgment binding upon him in favor of his vendees, he is a party thereto within the meaning of our statute which prohibits parties from testifying against the heirs or legal representatives of decedents.
No attempt was made to introduce the several deeds referred to above as ancient instruments. The defendants relied entirely upon proving their execution by the witness McConnell. Ikard v. Thompson, 81 Texas, 291.
Appellants also strenuously insist that the verbal locative contracts, in so far as they were made or authorized by married women, would be void, because not acknowledged in compliance with our statute regulating the conveyance by a married woman of her separate property; but we are of the opinion that this position is not well taken.
This question has recently been very thoroughly considered by our Supreme Court in the case of Ikard v. Thompson, cited above, and the conclusion reached, that a married woman can make contracts to acquire land by the location of a land certificate, which is her separate property, without acknowledging the same in the manner required for the conveyance of her real estate; and as to the correctness of this decision we do not entertain a.ny question. Aycock v. Kimbrough, 71 Texas. 330; Lecomte v. Toudouze, 82 Texas, 213.
The language used in the sixth special finding ""by the court below is susceptible to the construction that the court was of opinion that one tenant would have implied authority from his cotenant to contract to give a part of the land for the location of the certificate, and subdivision fourth of appellant’s eighth assignment calls in question this view of the law. We do not understand that the court below based its decision upon this ground, it having in the same connection found that McConnell had express authority from his cotenants to make such a contract. In Stone v. Ellis, 69 Texas, 325, it is expressly decided that one heir has no such implied authority from the other heirs. Also see Grimes v. Smith, 70 Texas, 217, and Sypert v. McCowen, 28 Texas, 640.
In rendering its judgment the court below allowed the defendant to retain the interest of R. C. McConnell in the land in controversy, he having previously filed a disclaimer as one of the parties to the suit. We think this action of the court was correct. While one tenant in common ■can recover from a stranger the whole property, he can only recover from Ms cotenant in possession the interest which he really owns.
If the court upon another trial should find that the Virginia Ranch, Land, and Cattle Company is the owner of an undivided interest with plaintiffs in the land in controversy, then plaintiffs could not dispossess it, and would only be entitled to a decree establishing their respective interests in the land. Boone v. Knox, 80 Texas, 643.
It seems that in making the deed to Henry Warren for his locative interest in the land, Isaac McConnell purported to convey in his own name and not as agent for the heirs of Anthony Bates; and appellants contend that such conveyance would not affect the interest of such heirs, even though McConnell might have been their agent, with authority to make the same. In common law courts there would be much in this objection, but as our courts have the power to look to equitable as well as legal titles, the tendency of our decisions has been to hold that such a conveyance would pass whatever right the person making it had to convey, whether it be signed as agent or principal. Rogers v. Bracken, 15 Texas, 564; Daughtrey v. Knolle, 44 Texas, 450; Hough v. Hill, 47 Texas, 153.
Delivered November 15, 1892.
Appellant’s seventeenth assignment calls in question the action of the court in failing to allow him rent for any part of the land. Before one tenant can make his cotenant liable to him for the use of the common property, he must show that he has been refused joint occupancy, and this does not seem to have been attempted in this case. Neil v. Shackelford, 45 Texas, 119; Osborn v. Osborn, 62 Texas, 495; Akin v. Jefferson, 65 Texas, 142.
Appellant’s remaining assignments of error are directed to calling in question the sufficiency of the evidence to support certain findings of the court, but as the cause will have to be remanded, we have thought it best to express no opinion thereon. For the error of the court in permitting-the witness McConnell to testify, as indicated in the first part of this opinion, let the judgment of the court below be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial in accordance herewith.
Reversed and remanded."
219110,Pullman Palace Car Company v. D. McDonald,1893-02-23,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
Appellee bought an excursion ticket from Galveston to San Antonio and return, via the International & Great Northern Railway from Galveston to Houston and the Southern Pacific from Houston to San Antonio.
When ready to return from San Antonio to Galveston he applied to the agent of the appellant at San Antonio for a sleeping car ticket. The agefit required him to produce his railroad ticket, which the appellee did, and then sold appellee a ticket for a berth on the sleeper San Pedro from San Antonio to Galveston, for which he paid the agent the price demanded. On arrival at Houston the car San Pedro was detached from the Southern Pacific train and attached to a Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe train, to be taken to Galveston. After having proceeded a short distance from- Houston, appellee was advised by the conductor of the sleeping car that he could not travel over the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe on his train ticket, because it was for passage over the International & Great Northern Railway. He claimed his right to go to Galveston on the San Pedro, but he was told by the railway conductor that he must pay fare or leave the train. Not having money to pay fare, he chose to leave the train, and was, from about six or seven miles out, returned to Houston free of charge on a north bound train over the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway.
This action was brought to recover damages for the breach of appellant’s contract to carry the appellee to Galveston in one of its sleeping ears.
Plaintiff alleged, that by reason of the breach he suffered much trouble, inconvenience, annoyance, delay, expense, mental pain, and distress. The cause was tried by a jury, and resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $879.15.
The sleeping car ticket contained the stipulation, 51 Good for this date and car only, when accompanied by first class railroad ticket; San Antonio to Galveston,” and was sold after defendant’s agent had inspected the plaintiff’s railroad ticket. Plaintiff had no knowledge of any exclusive arrangement between the defendant company and the Gulf, Colorado <& Santa Fe Railway Company, by which the latter should transport the cars of the former from Houston to Galveston, and could rely upon an implied undertaking on the part of the defendant to carry him to Galveston over the route designated in his railroad ticket. It was reasonably within the contemplation of the parties when the sleeping car ticket was sold and the contract of carriage entered into, that the plaintiff would be subject to ejection from defendant’s car for nonpayment of fare, if said car should not be transported to Galveston over the route called for, which was the International & Great Northern Railway. Hence the measure of damage would be for such mental suffering or feeling of humiliation as attended the ejection as a direct result therefrom, and such inconvenience, expense, and loss of time as might be shown to be the direct, natural, and proximate result of the breach of the contract to carry. Railway v. Gilbert, 64 Texas, 536; Railway v. Terry, 62 Texas, 380.
Plaintiff was permitted to testify, over the objection of the defendant, that upon his return to Houston he experienced mental distress by reason of his not arriving at Galveston on the morning of the same dajq and from the apprehension that his delay might cause him to be discharged from his employer’s service, and from the fear that he could not get to Galveston in time to make a remittance to his principal, according to his usual custom of transacting business with his principal.
The causes for damages shown by this evidence, other than such mental worry as might ordinarily attend his delay in reaching Galveston, were not reasonably within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into, and if cause for damages at all, it should have been alleged and proved by the plaintiff that the facts were known to the defendant at the time, and that plaintiff was liable by reason of the condition of his business affairs to suffer loss if he should not reach Galveston in the morning rather than in the evening. For the same reason the court erred also in the admission of the evidence of W. T. Wall, a witness for the plaintiff, as well as for the further reason that part of this testimony was the mere opinion of the witness.
Plaintiff was permitted to show that he did not have sufficient money to pay his fare to Galveston, as a reason why he did not pay fare and continue on his journey, instead of suffering himself to be ejected. The defendant objected to the evidence as irrelevant and immaterial, and that there was neither allegation nor evidence that the state of the witness’ resources was communicated or known to defendant when the ticket was purchased, and that the damages that might result from the fact were not in the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made. A passenger will not be required to pay fare twice, or fare in excess of the proper fare, to prevent the damages resulting from a wrongful ejection by the carrier. Railway v. Mackie, 71 Texas, 491. But in this case no additional fare was demanded by the defendant, and the ejection was made for the failure of the plaintiff to pay the railroad fare, and we think that under the circumstances it was the duty of the plaintiff to pay the railroad fare if he had the money, so as not to aggravate the damages, the rule being that he must use reasonable care to prevent the aggravation of damages; and for this reason the evidence was admissible.
Defendant requested the following charge, the refusal of which is assigned as error:
“ By the issuance of the sleeping car ticket by the agent at San Antonio, the defendant assumed no liability for any breach thereof that might occur, unless damage should follow such breach, and such damage was proximate to the breach.
“ Defendant is in no event liable for any damage to plaintiff’s feelings, or for his mental distress growing out of his failure to get to Galveston at the regular morning hour of arrival of the train which he left at the switch, or growing out of his fear of discharge from service in the sewing machine company.”
There was no error in refusing this instruction, because, while the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover for mental anxiety occasioned by his failure to reach Galveston on account of special business considerations, still his general discomfort and inconvenience growing out of such failure would be proper elements of damage.
As the judgment of the court below will be reversed for the error indicated with reference to the admission of evidence, it will not be necessary to pass upon the assignment of error, that the verdict of the jury is excessive in amount, nor those relating to the language of plaintiff’s counsel in examining the witness Curry and in his opening remarks to the jury, as they also relate to the probable prejudice of the jury in assessing damages which are assigned as excessive.
The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and, remanded.

216277,Jot Gunter v. S. A. Lillard & Co.,1892-11-15,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
Appellees, S. A. Lillard & Co., brought this suit in the District Court of Wise County, upon a promissory note in the sum of $100, against W. H. Cox, as maker of said note, and sought to foreclose an alleged vendor’s lien on 80 acres of land situated in said county, against appellant, Jot Gunter, and his tenant, J. E. Cook. At the February Term, 1890, of said court, a judgment was rendered in favor of appellees for the amount of the note against Cox, and against the other defendants, foreclosing the lien on said land; the defendant Cox having made default and Cook having filed a disclaimer. The cause was tried without a jury, and is brought here by appellant, without any statement of facts, upon the trial court’s conclusions of law and fact.
It appears from the bill of exceptions in the record that plaintiffs below read in evidence, over the objection of appellant on the ground of a variance, the note upon which the suit was founded, which by its terms was made payable as follows, “ to bearer E. I-I. or W. D. Wheeler.” This note had been attached to the first amended original petition, to which it was at that time still attached. The suit was tried upon a second amended original petition, which is the only petition of appellees in the record; and in that petition the note was described as being payable to the “ bearer or E. H. & W. D. Wheeler.” The note in this second amended petition was otherwise accurately and fully described, and was referred to as being thereto attached. Besides assigning error upon the admission of this evidence, appellant made the following assignment: ‘1 The court erred in holding that the notes sued on are secured by a vendor’s lien upon the land in controversy.” No other assignments are contained in appellant’s brief.
We here refer to and adopt the conclusions of fact filed in the court below as our conclusions of fact.
Appellant insists that the court erred in overruling his objection to the introduction in evidence of the note sued upon, on the ground of a variance between it and the description of it in the petition, and cites us to the case of Warren v. Scott, 32 Iowa, 22. In that case the promise was, to “ pay to the bearer, M. C. Murdough,” and it was held that its legal effect was the same as though the word “ bearer ” had been omitted. It seems to us that there is a difference in the effect of the language employed in that note and the one herein sued upon. As we construe this note, it is equivalent to a promise to pay to E. H. Wheeler or W. D. Wheeler or bearer, and is a negotiable note. The one described in the petition is correctly interpreted by appellant to read to E. H. Wheeler and W. D. Wheeler or bearer. The note as described and the note as introduced in evidence are alike negotiable and payable to bearer, and are substantially the same. Certain it is, that there is no such difference between them as to mislead or surprise appellant, which is the test laid down by our Supreme Court. Patterson v. Taylor, 64 Texas, 55. As bearing upon this question of surprise, we think that the fact of its being filed as an exhibit to the pleading, superseded by the second amendment, and again referred to in the said second amendment as attached thereto, might be properly considered without violating any of the rules of pleading prescribed for the District Court.
Delivered November 15, 1892.
The appellees object to our considering the propositions submitted by appellant under the assignment quoted above. We are of opinion that this assignment is too general. The matter in litigation in the trial court involved the validity of the alleged lien on the land in controversy. Nothing else was controverted. We think this assignment is equivalent to an assertion that the court erred in rendering judgment against appellant. He caused the court to file conclusions of law and fact, in which were set forth the different grounds upon which the judgment foreclosing said lien was rested. We think if appellant desired us to review, any of these several grounds or propositions he should have designated by his assignment the ground or grounds of error relied upon; otherwise, conclusions of law and fact would be useless. We have, however, examined the record sufficiently to satisfy us that no material error was committed by the court below in foreclosing said lien.
It'is concluded that the judgment appealed from should in all things be affirmed.
Affirmed."
219155,Galveston City Railway Company v. Gulf Land Company,1893-02-23,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
This action was brought in the County Court of Galveston County by the Gulf Land Company against the Galveston City Kailroad Company, to recover rent on a contract for the lease of the east half of outlet 119 in the city of Galveston.
The defense was, that since the execution of the lease in 1884, and before the accrual of the rents sued for, the property leased had been sub-r merged and encroached upon by the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, so that it was in great part below ordinary high tide, and that because of the cutting away of the beach, and the consequent depletion of the land, it had ceased to be owned by plaintiff, and was not subject to lease nor under private dominion, and the lease was therefore terminated.
The plaintiff replied, traversing the answer, and asserting that the property had been leased by defendant to prevent another street railway company from gaining the control or use of it. Trial was had without a jury, and judgment was for plaintiff.
No conclusions of fact and of law were filed by the judge who tried the case.
1. The contract for lease was in writing, and is as follows:
“Articles of agreement made and entered into this 30th day of April, A. D. 1884, by and between the Gulf Land Company, of the County of Galveston, State of Texas, party of the first part, and the Galveston City Railroad Company, of said county and State, party of the second part, for the lease and occupation of the properties herein mentioned, witnesseth:
“ That for and in consideration of the rents herein reserved, and of the covenants and stipulations herein entered into by the party of the second part, by said party to be observed and performed, the said party of the.’ first part has leased and by these presents doth lease unto the party of the second part all and singular that certain piece or parcel of land lying and being situated in the city of Galveston, in the county of Galveston and State of Texas, and known and described as according to the map and plan of the city as part of outlet numbered 119, being the east half of said outlot numbered 119.
“To have and to hold, use, and enjoy the same, and every part thereof, unto the said party of the second part and its assigns, for and during the period of eight years and two months from and after the first day of May, 1884, subject only to the following terms and conditions: •
“ First. The party of the second part hereby covenants and agrees in consideration thereof that it will pay therefor to the party of the first, part the sum of 8100 every three months, lawful money, in advance, on the first of each and every third month on and after the first day of May, 1884, at the office of the said party of the second part, to the said party of the first part or its lawful authorized agents.
“ Second. The party of the second part may erect and construct buildings and improvements on said leased premises, and at the termination of this lease may remove such improvements therefrom, all rents being first paid, excepting and reserving the trees, shrubbery, plants, and sodding, which becomes the property of the owners of the soil as soon as placed therein or thereon, and which are not to be disturbed except for the purpose of cultivation or improvement.
“ Third. The party of the second part covenants and agrees to and with the party of the first part, that neither sand nor earth shall be taken. away or removed from said premises leased, and that said premises shall be kept intact, and that the same shall be surrendered to the parties of the first part at the expiration of the term of this lease, with the same surface area as when leased; provided, however, that the party of the second part shall not be held liable or responsible for any injury, waste, or depletion resulting from the act of God or any other cause beyond the control of the party of the second part. Nothing in this article contained shall be construed as to prevent the party of the second part from handling and removing the earth and sand from point to point for the purpose of grading, levelling, or other necessary improvements upon said premises.
‘ ‘ Fourth. It is agreed by and between the parties, each with the other, that the party of the' first part shall render for taxation to the proper officers of the property herein leased, that the parties of the second part shall pay all taxes levied and assessed thereon, without recourse on the party of the first part therefor, and will deliver to the party of the first .part all vouchers and tax receipts executed by the proper officers as evidence of such payments.
“ Fifth'. It is agreed between the parties, that the party of the second part shall pay the State, county, and school taxes for the year 1884, the city tax having been paid before the date of this lease.
“Sixth. It is understood by and between the parties, each with the other, that a lien is to exist upon all improvements erected upon said leased premises during this lease to insure the payment of the rent of said premises as stipulated herein, the payment of said rent as it becomes due to operate as a discharge of said property from said lien for the current rent without other written discharge of said lien.
“ Seventh. The party of the second part covenants and agrees to and with the party of the first part, that during this lease the said party of the second part will keep the aforesaid premises enclosed with a good and lawful fence along the east and north boundaries thereof, and will keep the boundaries of the front or south side of the premises protected as near the line of common high tide as practicable.
1 ‘ In testimony of all of which, the said Gulf Land Company and the Galveston City Eailway Company have caused this agreement to be signed by their respective presidents and attested by their respective seals, on the day and year first above written.”
The contract was duly signed by both parties, and was acknowledged for record by the Gulf Land Company by its president.
2. The land is on the shore of the Gulf of Mexico, and when the lease was executed, and for some time prior thereto, about two-thirds thereof was below ordinary high tide, which was known to the defendant. Since said time there has been a continual depletion of the land by the encroachment of the waters of the gulf upon the shore, and at the time of trial, and when defendant refused to pay rent, there was only about one-seventy-second part of the entire property above ordinary high tide, and this portion is all on the beach, which by city ordinance is declared a public highway. There was a considerable erosion of the land at the time of the storm in 1886, and the greater part occurred then and since.
3. On November 1, 1889, the defendant failed to pay the installment of rent then due, and refused to pay rent except for such portion of the land as was not on or beyond the beach and under water, and ■ no rent has been paid for the time since November 1, 1889.
4. No improvements were upon the land when the lease was executed, nor were any placed thereon during the lease. The land was not used nor occupied by the defendant for any purpose, but defendant had a large building just northwest of the property, and leased the same to prevent its being occupied by objectionable neighbors, and to prevent the Gulf City Railway and Real Estate Company, a rival railway company, from renting or occupying it and getting its line of street railway through to the east end of the island. Defendant did not use nor occupy the property, and made no business use thereof. Defendant stopped paying rent about the time it became consolidated with the rival company.
While we believe that in a proper case rent for property totally destined should be abated, and when there is a partial destruction of the property it should be apportioned, we do not think that principle of law applies to the facts of this case. The purpose of the lease was clearly to prevent the use of any part of the lot by the Gulf City Street Railway and Real Estate Company; and it is evident that the defendant, when it procured the lease, was willing to pay the entire sum of money the full term amounted to in order to be able to keep the rival company from using the property. Defendant got all that it ever realty contracted for. It knew at the time the lease was made that about two-thirds of the land was under water, and was a daily witness of this erosion of the beach and the encroachment of the water. We are of the opinion that the judgment of the court below was right, and should, be affirmed.
Affirmed.

216280,Bupp & Robbins v. J. F. O'Connor & Co.,1892-11-15,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
Appellees brought this suit as plaintiffs in the court below, to recover of appellants a balance of $614.13, with interest at 8 per cent per annum, alleged to be due them upon an open account. Appellants answered, in effect, that they took a contract to do certain railway grading for appellees, and that appellees agreed to advance tools, money, supplies, etc., to them during the prosecution of the work, and after the principal part of the work had been completed, appellees refused to comply with their part of the contract, and appellants, being unable to complete the same without such assistance, were by such refusal caused damage in a considerable sum. The accounts between the parties being voluminous, an auditor was appointed by the court, who filed his report, showing a balance due appellants of $93.90. After moving to strike out the report of the auditor, which was overruled by the court, appellees filed exceptions to the different items complained of by them in the report, and the whole case was submitted under the charge of the court to the jury, who found a verdict in favor of appellees for $235.27, and from the judgment rendered thereon this appeal is prosecuted. No statement of facts accompanies the record.
Appellants, under their first assignment of error, present the proposition that “ after a motion to set aside an auditor’s report has been overruled, such report is conclusive of all matters upon which it shows that the auditor admitted and heard evidence, and thereupon reported his conclusions, unless it appears that the auditor’s acts were irregular as to some item or items, and then only such items are subject to further proof.”
After the court had overruled their motion to exclude the auditor’s report altogether, appellees, with great particularity, filed their exceptions to different items in the report, and we are of opinion that the practice adopted was in all things in compliance with our statute and decisions, and that appellees did all that they were required to do to secure a trial by jury upon the disputed items in their account. In authorizing the appointment of an auditor in oases involving complicated accounts, it was not the intention of the Legislature to deprive the parties of the right to secure a jury trial upon the disputed items; but as said in Kempner v. Galveston County, 76 Texas, 457, quoting from Dwyer v. Kalteyer, 68 Texas, 554, “ The purpose of the appointment of an auditor is to have an account so made up that the undisputed items upon either side may be eliminated from the contest and the issue thereby narrowed to the points actually in dispute. The items of an account in an auditor’s report not excepted to by either party are conclusive, but as to such as are excepted to the report is without effect.”
In Richie v. Levy, 69 Texas, 138, the practice and effect of appointing an auditor under our statute is also reviewed at length. We are therefore of the opinion that an auditor’s report is only conclusive as to the items not excepted to, and that the court did not err in submitting thé contested items to the decision of the jury.
Upon the trial appellees were permitted to introduce in evidence their books of account, to which appellants objected, on tlie ground .that no sufficient predicate for their introduction had been laid. In Baldridge v. Penland, 68 Texas, 443, the admissibility of such books is very fully considered, and in that case, in order to make them admissible, it is said: “ 1. It must be shown that tlie books offered contained the daily record of the business of the person for whom they are kept as it transpires from day to day between himself and customers, and that the entries therein are original entries, made contemporaneously with the transaction of the business which the entries are intended to evidence. 2. The entries must relate to the business carried on by the person for whom the books are kept, and not to matters in no way connected with that business. 3. The entries must be sufficient to show with reasonable certainty what thing is made the basis of the charge., 4. The book must be on its face regular, and the entries free from suspicion or alteration. 5. The person offering such books, if they be kept by himself, must ordinarily, if living, make oath to tlieir correctness; and we think further, that he should be held to make proof tending to show his probity and fair dealing; as that the accounts of other persons kept in the same manner are usually found correct, or so treated by his customers.” To the same effect is Underwood v. Parrott, 2 Texas, 168.
The bill of exceptions incorporated in the record hardly shows a sufficient compliance by appellees with the requirements of the law to make their books admissible. We are. unable to see from their bill of exceptions that the books offered were the books of original entries, or that the entries therein were made contemporaneously with the transaction, or that the books appeared fair and regular upon their face. But we are of opinion that it would not be proper for us to treat this bill of exceptions as containing a full account of all the evidence introduced in the case, which could have been considered in connection,with these books, and that in the absence of a statement of facts from which we could tell with certainty that the appellants had been injured by this action of the court, we would not be authorized to reverse the cause. Lockett v. Schurenberg, 60 Texas, 610. In fact, this bill of exceptions shows that one Merriweather, who assisted in keeping these books, was present at the trial, and, so far as we can tell from the record, he may have fully proven up this account without reference to the books, so as to make the evidence complained of immaterial. The case in 60 Texas, cited above, will be found to contain a full review of the authorities illustrating the practice of the Supreme Court in this State where no statement of facts accompanies the record and an error is assigned to the admission or exclusion of evidence.
Delivered November 15, 1892.
The contract between appellants and appellees for doing work upon the railroad was in writing, but nothing was said therein as to the agreement on the part of appellees to furnish appellants with supplies, etc., as alleged in their answer. It is not pretended but that this part of the contract was entered into contemporaneously with the written one and was a part of the same agreement, and no allegations of fraud, accident, or mistake are made to explain why it ivas not incorporated in the writing. Under these circumstances, we are of the opinion that the court did not err in refusing to admit evidence as to such contemporaneous verbal contract. See Rubrecht v. Powers, decided by this court at its present term, and authorities therein cited. In the absence of a statement of facts we are unable to see that there was any error in the action of the court in excluding the evidence offered by appellants as to the relative, cost of the different parts of the work they had undertaken to do. We believe that before a court should feel authorized to reverse a case for alleged error in the admission or exclusion of evidence, it should be furnished with a full statement of the facts proven on the trial; or at least the bill of exceptions should show with certainty the materiality of the evidence when considered in connection with all that had been proven upon the trial. It would certainly be a dangerous practice for appellate courts to undertake to act upon abstract questions of this kind without being furnished with sufficient data in the record to enable it to decide upon the importance of the question in reference to the whole case.
We are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be in all things affirmed.
Affirmed."
216176,William Cunningham v. J. H. Holcomb,1892-11-15,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
William Cunningham prosecutes this writ of error from a judgment rendered by the District Court of Eastland County against him and others in favor of J. H. Holcomb, defendant in error, in the month of December, 1887, on the promissory note of said Cunningham, foreclosing the vendor’s lien on a tract of land situated in Eastland County. The case was tried without a jury.
In the month of May, 1884, J. S. Bedford, who was the son-in-law of defendant in error, under a power of attorney authorizing him to convey two certain tracts of land owned by defendant in error in Eastland County, conveyed to plaintiff in error the tract of land upon which the lien was foreclosed by the judgment of the court below. The deed recited a cash consideration of $1400, and three certain negotiable promissory notes of $1666.66 each, payable in one, two, and three years, one of which notes was the foundation of this suit. This deed was executed on the 24th of May, 1884, and recorded the 1st day of July following. No lien was expressly retained in the face of the deed, but the notes recited that they were secured by a lien on the land. About the 12th day of July he conveyed the other tract of land to the same party, the deed reciting a cash consideration of $1200, and three notes for $2600 each, payable in three, four, and five years, to secure the payment of which a lien was expressly reserved in the face of the deed. The proof tended to show, that these two tracts of land did not exceed in value $8000; that these deeds were executed between said Bedford and Cunningham for some fraudulent purpose; that there was no cash paid; that Holcomb was ignorant of the recitals in saicl deed and of any fraudulent purpose on the part of said Bedford and Cunningham; that Cunningham was totally insolvent and without credit; that Holcomb, who lived on his farm in Erath County, was worth about $40,000 above his exemptions and liabilities. At the date of this transaction one Jake Alexander was engaged in the mercantile business in the town of Cisco, claiming to have an investment therein of about $20,000, over and above his debts and liabilities. The proof tended to show, that the purpose in the execution of said deeds, and especially the last deed, was to negotiate the notes with Holcomb’s endorsements to Alexander for an interest in his mercantile business, which was afterward done; and in consideration of which he conveyed to Bedford a one-lialf interest therein. The notes, with the endorsement of Holcomb, were delivered to him, but as the}1"" exceeded in amount the estimated value of a half-interest in said mercantile business, Alexander and Bedford executed to Holcomb their note for the difference, in the sum of $2200. The proof tended to show, that when these notes were negotiated, and the transaction which resulted in the purchase of an interest in the said business was accomplished, said Holcomb was in very feeble health and in a state of mind bordering very close on to imbecility, and that he continued in this condition for sometime afterward — to use his own language, that he was “ not at himself;” and that when he did come to himself (which was after the notes had been negotiated by Alexander), he discov ered that the transaction between Bedford and Cunningham was fraudu lent, and took steps to protect himself from loss on account of the endorsement of said notes. About this time it was developed that Alexander, the merchant, was in a failing condition, and that he owed to one Solomon a debt of over $20,000, to whom said notes had been negotiated by him. It also appears, that after Solomon was notified that Holcomb would resist payment of the notes, a deed of trust was executed upon the stock of goods to secure this debt, and that at a meeting of these several parties, with their attorneys, an arrangement was made, to-wit, in the month of October, 1884, by which the stock of goods should be sold under the deed of trust and bid in by Holcomb at about $18,000, and upon his paying this sum and assuming liens on real estate in the sum of $10,000 additional, his notes should be returned to him, which transaction was consummated; and the loss sustained by Holcomb was estimated at about $10,000. Prior to this last transaction, and after the goods were delivered under the trust deed, Bedford and Cunningham quitted the county of Eastland, where they had been residing, and remained absent from the country up to the time of the trial, nothing being heard from either of them, except that perhaps one of them was in South America. Cunningham, through an attorney who appeared for him, alleged these transactions and charged that they were fraudulent, and that Holcomb, through his agent, had assisted in accomplishing them, and had ratified the act of his alleged agent by endorsing said notes and by purchasing said stock of goods and by bringing this suit upon one of these notes.
Delivered November 15, 1892.
We think the facts in the record warrant the following conclusions: first, that Bedford and Cunningham entered into a conspiracy to defraud Holcomb, and perhaps others, and that the deeds were executed in pursuance of said fraudulent conspiracy; second, that Holcomb did not knowingly and freely assent thereto; third, that his conduct, upon discovering the fraud, was not intended as a ratification of the same, but was influenced by a prudential desire to protect himself from the consequences of the fraud. While other conclusions might be drawn from the evidence, we think the testimony is sufficient to support the above theories.
The principle invoked by the plaintiff m error for a reversal of the judgment of the court below, that where parties have voluntarily entered into a fraudulent contract, neither one will be permitted to become an actor in court, whether to enforce or set aside the contract, seems to be well settled. It is held in this State that even an assignee of a note executed in pursuance of such a contract can not maintain an action thereon where the same has been transferred to him without value paid. Davis v. Sittig, 65 Texas, 497. We are of opinion, however, that this principle is not applicable here. Our construction of the transactions disclosed in the record is that Holcomb was “ more sinned against than sinning.” It seems to be held (as we think correctly), that where a third person conspires with an agent to perpetrate a fraud upon the principal, and the rights of innocent third parties have not intervened, the principal is entitled to have a rescission of the contract made between his agent and such third party; or, if he elects not to have it rescinded, to have such other adequate relief as a court of equity may deem proper under the circumstances. Mech. on Agency, sec. 797. It seems, also, to be laid down, that before a person connected with a fraudulent transaction will be refused a day in court, it must appear that he yielded a free and unbiased consent thereto; and that, in some cases, the most excusable of the parties engaged will be relieved. Bump. on Fraud. Con., 449; Rome. Eq., sec. 403, and notes.
Our conclusion is, that the trial court would not have been justified, on the ground of public policy, in refusing the relief sought to be applied, and that the facts warranted the judgment rendered; it is therefore affirmed.
Affirmed."
216178,H. T. Buse v. Mahlon Bartlett et al.,1892-11-15,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
Appellees, on the 19tli of April, 1889, brought suit in the ordinary form of trespass to try title in the District Court of Wichita County, to recover of appellant a section of land, which resulted in a judgment in their favor, on the 8th day of November, 1889, from which this appeal is prosecuted.
In December, 1873, W. W. Purinton brought suit in the District Court of Montague County against Thomas R. Odell, in an action of debt, and sued out a writ of attachment, which was levied upon the section of land in controversy and also upon another section of land, both situated in Wichita County. He alleged his residence to be in Grayson County, and that said Odell was a nonresident of the.State of Texas, and made the necessary affidavit to obtain service by publication, as well as a writ of attachment. The citation was duly published, in December, 1873, and January, 1874, in the Gainesville Gazette, a newspaper published in Cooke County, Texas, for four successive weeks prior to the return day, as shown by the return thereon, though the dates of publication were not stated. The citation commanded that it be served by making publication in some newspaper published in the county of Montague, if there should be a newspaper published in said county, but if not, then in the nearest county where a newspaper was published. The necessary attachment bond was duly executed, and the writ of attachment was levied on the 19th day of December, 1873. The defendant in the suit made no appearance, and in July, 1874, judgment was rendered against him in said court in the sum of 8512, foreclosing the attachment lien on said two sections of land and directing the clerk to issue an order of sale to the sheriff of Clay County, Texas, commanding him to seize and sell said property as under execution on the first Tuesday in September, 1874. This order of sale was duly issued as directed, and was executed by the sheriff of Clay County, who, after making due advertisement, sold said property to the highest bidder, before the court house door of Clay County, on the first Tuesday in September, 1874, for the aggregate sum of 8561.60, which satisfied the judgment, interest, and costs; the plaintiff Purinton being the successful bidder, to whom deed was made. On the 14tli day of August, 1875, by deed duly executed and recorded, Purinton conveyed the tract of land in controversy to C. F. Lucas, and thereafter, by warranty deed dated December 1, 1885, and duly recorded in Wichita County, said Lucas conveyed to appellant. Appellant never had actual possession of the land, but his vendor, Lucas, was in the possession and use of it from May 15, 1883, to May 15, 1886, and since May 15, 1886, it has not been occupied. It is agreed by the parties to this suit that the rents for these three years were worth 8192. We fail to find in the record any evidence as to what the considerations were for the deeds, first, from Purinton to Lucas, and, second, from Lucas to appellant. Appellant, in addition to his plea of not guilty, set up the statute of limitations of three years, and claimed reimbursement from appellees for the amount of the judgment satisfied by the sale of said land under the order of sale. Appellees, in reply to this claim, and against said judgment and lien, asserted the statute of limitation of two, four, and ten years. The cause was tried without a jury, but no conclusions of law and fact were filed. Appellees, through a quitclaim deed, showed title in themselves from Odell, the grantee and defendant in the original judgment.
The title of appellant depends for support on the judgment rendered in Montague County, and the sale made thereunder in Clay County. Either the judgment or the sale must be declared void, as contradistinguished from voidable, in order to sustain the judgment appealed from. Our conclusion is, that the judgment can not be so declared. Many cases hold that a person who invokes the protection of a judgment rendered against a nonresident on attachment and publication proceedings must show affirmatively by the record that everything necessary to the jurisdiction was actually and rightly done. Other cases hold that the same presumptions will be indulged in support of such a judgment as where there has been personal service. The latter rule has been adopted by the Supreme Court of this State. Stewart v. Anderson, 70 Texas, 588; Tread-way v. Eastburn, 57 Texas, 209; Lawler v. White, 27 Texas, 250; Black on Judg., sec. 281.
We will therefore presume that the sheriff of Montague County followed the command in the citation, .and published it in the newspaper of the nearest county, because there was no newspaper published in Montague, in the absence of proof to the contrary; and also that the requisite number of publications was made, though the return did not give the dates, but only stated that it had been published the four successive weeks before return day in the specified newspaper published in Cooke County.
The failure to file a statement of facts after the court had obtained jurisdiction by attachment, and rendered judgment on service by publication, could not render the judgment void. This provision of the statute must have been intended to secure to the nonresident defendant the benefit of a review of the judgment in a direct proceeding. The law which prescribes the venue in suits against nonresidents seems to have been introduced with the Revised Statutes. We conclude, therefore, that appellees’ objections to the Montague judgment can not avail them on a collateral attack.
The question raised as to the alleged invalidity of the sale is more difficult of solution. Appellees insist, that at the date of the sale, September, 1874, Wichita County, then unorganized, was not under the jurisdiction of Clay County, and hence that the sale by the sheriff of that county of land situated in Wichita must be held void, on the authority of those cases which hold that an execution sale of land made at any other place than the door of the court house of the county where the land is situated is a nullity. Their theory is, that as a result of an act of the Legislature passed in February, 1874, amending the thirteenth section of the Act of August 10,1870 (whereby Wichita, with other unorganized counties, had been attached for judicial purposes to Montague County), Wichita was left unattached for judicial purposes to any organized county, and that therefore it fell back to the jurisdiction of the county out of whose territory it had been originally created, and that the parent county was other than Clay. We are cited in support of this view to those cases which hold, that when a new county is created out of the territory of an organized county, it remains, to all intents and purposes, a part and parcel of the parent county until it is organized, or at least till the Legislature attaches it to some other county or district; and also to those decisions in which the expressions contained in the opinions indicate that this rule should be extended to cases where an unorganized county has been once attached to an organized county and the act attaching it has been repealed without attaching it to any other county. Lumpkin v. Muncey, 66 Texas, 311, and cases there cited; Alford v. Jones, 71 Texas, 519; Baker v. Beck, 74 Texas, 562; Merrill v. Roberts, 64 Texas, 445.
The reason of the rule adopted in these cases is, in substance, stated to be, that every citizen is entitled to the benefits of civil government; and where there is no express law to the contrary, he may look to the courts and officers of the old county for protection till the new one is organized. Following the rule laid down in these cases, we have endeavored to trace the legislative history of Wichita County; and, with the facilities at our command, have been unable to find where it was ever carved out of the territory of an organized county. The present territory of Wichita County seems originally to have been included in the Fannin Land District, and subsequently, to-wit, by the Act of 1854, in the Cooke County Land District. Sayles’ Early Laws, art. 2422. In the year 1856 Young County was created, with a territory attached for judicial purposes which included the present area of Wichita. Ib., arts. 2519, 2559. The succeeding Legislature, on the 24th day of December, 1857, created the counties of Montague and Clay (lb., 2663, 2664), and on the 1st of February, 1858, the county of Wichita. Ib., 2705. In the act creating the county of Clay a territory was attached thereto for judicial and general purposes which included the present area of Wichita County. Ib., art. 2664. In the act creating Wichita and many other counties we find this provision: “ That until attached by law to some judicial district or .districts, each of said counties shall be attached, for judicial purposes, in matters pertaining to the jurisdiction of the District Court, to the nearest county in which the District Court may be held.” By an act passed in 1860, Wichita, with other counties, was attached to Montague for judicial purposes, with the provision that upon the organization of Clay County they should belong to Clay. Ib., art. 2883. This law was substantially re-enacted in 1866. Acts 1866, p. 94. By an act approved July 2, 1870, districting the State into judicial districts, Wichita and other unorganized counties were attached to the Twelfth Judicial District for judicial purposes, which district was composed of Montague and other counties. Acts 1870, p. 21. By an act approved August 10, 1870, fixing the times for holding District Courts in the several districts, in its thirteenth section, which fixed the time for the courts in said Twelfth District, it was further provided that for judicial purposes Clay, Wichita, and other counties should be attached to Montague; and in the last section all laws and parts of laws in conflict with said act were repealed. Ib., pp. 53, 59. It appears that in 1873 Clay County was organized; and in February, 1874, said thirteenth section of the Act of 1870 was amended by the substitution of a new section, which fixed the time for holding courts in the several counties of the Twelfth Judicial District, including the county of Clay, but did not attach the counties previously attached, including Wichita, to any organized county. Acts 1874, p. 7.
It seems that when Clay County was organized it was the nearest county to Wichita in which a District Court was held, and that prior thereto Montague had been the nearest county. It seems also that the first Legislature which assembled after Clay County was organized, as well as the judge of the Twelfth Judicial District and the county officers in that section of the State, must have construed the previous legislation as placing the territory of Wichita County under the jurisdiction of Clay upon the organization of the latter; and we are not prepared to say that this construction was wrong.
It is true that our Court of Appeals, in 1876, in the case of Holden v. The State, 1 Texas Court of Appeals, 234, in an elaborate and plausible opinion, held that the Act of 1870 repéaled the Act of 1866, by which it was provided that upon the organization of Clay County, Wichita and other counties should belong to Clay. We, however, doubt the correctness of that decision. The first ground upon which it was rested is, that as the Act of 1870 contained a repealing clause of all conflicting legislation, there was an express repeal, because the Act of 1866 only attached Wichita and other counties to Montague temporarily, till the organization of Clay, while the attachment of these and other counties to Montague by the Act of 1870 was apparently permanent. It seems to us that in both cases only a temporary status was intended to be effected, and that there was no conflict between the two acts. The other ground is, that there was an implied repeal, because the Acts of 1870 were subsequent statutes, revising the whole subject matter of the former one, and evidently intended as a substitute for it. The two Acts of 1870, districting the State and fixing times for holding courts under the Constitution of 1869, were evidently substitutes for the two similar acts of 1866, but the Act of 1866 in question was not one of these. Its scope was limited to the one purpose of attaching said counties. The doctrine of repeal by revision, even where there is no repugnance, is well settled, and is rested upon the presumption of a complete treatment of the subject embraced; but it seems also to be laid down as a part of this doctrine, that if the revising act (as in this instance) contains an express repeal of all inconsistent acts and parts of acts, there is an implication that if there are parts of former acts not embraced in the new act and not inconsistent, they are not repealed. South. on Stat. Const., secs. 154, 155; Lewis v. Stout, 22 Wis., 225; Gaston v. Merriam, 33 Minn., 271; 22 N. W. Rep., 620-621. As repeals by implication are not favored, in view of the inconvenience and litigation which seem to have resulted from the ruling, we doubt if any repeal of that part of the Act of 1866 which provided for the attachment of Wichita to Clay upon the organization of the latter should ever have been implied.
It will be noted that the Act of 1874, amending the thirteenth section of the Act of August 10, 1870, left untouched the Act of July 2, 1870, which, among other things, contained the provision attaching Wichita for judicial purposes to the Twelfth District; unless, indeed, it should be held that that provision was so far rendered inoperative as to be repealed.
Without announcing any definite conclusions on the repealing force of the acts of 1870 and 1874, we think that, beginning with the Seventh Legislature, which created the Clay territory, and out of this territory Wichita County, providing in the very act creating the county, by a general saving clause, for its attachment to the nearest organized county, if not elsewhere attached, there runs through the several enactments on the subject a legislative purpose that Wichita County, until organized, should fall under the jurisdiction of Montague and Clay in succession as the nearest organized counties; and construing this legislation as a whole,, we conclude that at the date of the sale the territory of Wichita was subject to the jurisdiction of Clay.
If, however, it should be held that Wichita was not attached to Clay or any other organized county, it being without a parent county (unless, indeed, Clay should be deemed to stand in loco parentis), we conclude that the District Court of Montague County, having obtained jurisdiction of the property in controversy by a proceeding substantially in rem, had the power, in order to execute the decree of foreclosure, to designate some officer to make the sale at the time, place, and in the manner usual in foreclosure sales in this State; and that the sale made by the sheriff of Clay County, in accordance with the order of sale provided for in the decree, was not void, as would be an ordinary execution sale made in violation of a mandatory statute.
These conclusions have not been reached without hesitation, but until we can point to a place other than Clay County where the sale was directed by law to be made — and upon this subject appellees have furnished us no information — we are unwilling to declare it void. It seems to us that the principle announced in the cases which sustain the jurisdiction of the parent county, where there is no provision for jurisdiction elsewhere, should have application here.
Delivered November 15, 1892.
It is therefore concluded that the judgment of the court below should be reversed, and that judgment should be here rendered for appellant

219091,G. H. Alderman v. Jones & Robinson,1893-02-07,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
This suit originated in the Justice Court for precinct number 1, Wilbarger County, in which judgment was rendered in favor of appellees against appellant on‘the 30th day of September, 1891. Appellant undertook to appeal to the County Court from this judgment, and in his appeal bond described the judgment as having been rendered on the 28th day of September instead of the 30th, the correct date. In the County Court appellees moved to dismiss this appeal on account of this misdescription of the judgment, which motion was sustained by the court below and the appeal dismissed, from which this appeal is prosecuted.
The appeal bond correctly described the judgment rendered in the Justice Court by the number of the case, names of the parties, the court in which it was rendered, and the amount of the judgment, the only misdescription being in the date above set forth.
The decisions of our Supreme Court in the case of Railway v. Stanley, 76 Texas, 418, and of our Court of Appeals in Edwards v. Allen, 17 S. W. Rep., 1074, are conclusive that the action of the court below was erroneous, for which the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.

219076,Cordella A. H. Baker v. Margaret Burroughs,1893-02-07,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On the 27th day of January, 1877, patents were issued to Grimes County for four leagues of land, granted to it for educational purposes by virtue of an act approved January 15, 1850. The 160 acres of land in controversy in this suit is a part of this land, being embraced in league 146.
On the 19th of April, 1886, the Commissioners Court of Grimes County, at a regular term of said court, ordered that the four leagues of land mentioned above be sold, and directed the county judge of Grimes County to advertise the sale thereof. In pursuance of this order, the county judge duly advertised said land for sale in the Dallas Morning News. The land was offered for sale on not less than ten years time, with interest payable annually in advance, and the advertisement stated that bids would be received until the 25th day of June, 1886, the court reserving the right to reject any and all bids. In pursuance of this offer to sell, T. C. Buffington, L. McDaniel, and Jack Baker bid for said four leagues the sum of $2.45 per acre, on twenty years time, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, payable annually in advance, the interest to commence to run from the 1st day of September, 1886, and payable on or before October 1 of each and every year; the purchase money, principal and interest, being secured by a vendor’s lien on the land. This offer was accepted by the Commissioners Court and the sale confirmed. At the July term, 1886, said Buffington, McDaniel, and Baker complied with their bids, and deeds were executed to them.
Appellant claims under a regular chain of transfers from these purchasers, but it was agreed that her rights against appellee were only such as the purchasers from the county could enforce.
Appellee settled on the land in controversy in the spring of 1885, and put up a small box-house thereon in October, 1885, and dug a well, fenced and put in cultivation the first year about 4 acres, and had under-fence at the time of the sale by Grimes County about 80 acres; and at that time she was an actual settler on the land within the meaning of section 6 of article 7 of our Constitution. At this time appellee was a widow and had four children, two of whom were under 21 years of age,, and she made this settlement with the intention of making it her permanent home. At the time of the death of her husband, which occurred in Tarrant County, previous to the settlement of appellee upon this land, she was living with him upon a tract of 100 acres of land, which was his separate property, in Tarrant County, and at the time of his death this was their home, and this land is still owned by appellee and the children of her deceased husband. The improvements placed by appellee upon the land in controversy are worth $433. At the time appellee settled upon this land she had abandoned her homestead upon the 100 acres in Tarrant County, with the intention of not again returning to it.
On the 12th of November, 1886, appellee, through her attorney, H. L. Bentley, tendered to the Commissioners Court of Grimes County the notes and cash payment which would be due from her on a purchase upon the same terms as the sale made by said county to Buffington, McDaniel, and Baker, estimating the 160 acres claimed by her at $2.45 per acre, the price at which the four leagues were sold as aforesaid. This tender was made under the following circumstances: Mr. Bentley appeared before the Commissioners Court of Grimes County and offered and tendered the amount due as cash payment on the land, and also tendered the notes for the deferred payments. The Commissioners Court told him that it was not necessary to count the money, and they expressly waived the counting of the same, and told Mr. Bentley that the court had nothing to do with it. Afterwards Mr. Bentley made a tender in the same way of the notes and money to Buffington, who, on behalf of himself, McDaniel, and Baker, refused to accept the same, and said that he preferred to make his own sales.
Appellee had no actual notice of the sale to Buffington, McDaniel, and Baker until Baker, sometime after the sale, came to place the deeds to himself and others on record. They were filed for record in Taylor County September 15, 1886. This tender was also made by appellee in this case, and the money and notes deposited in court. Under this state of facts, appellee in her answer insisted upon her prior right to acquire the land in controversy under the section of our Constitution above referred to, and this appeal is prosecuted from a judgment in her favor recognizing such right.
Appellant in her first assignment of error insists, that inasmuch as appellee was the owner of an interest in other land, and entitled to a homestead right thereon, she was not an actual settler upon this land within the meaning of section 6 of article 7 of our Constitution; and in support of this contention cites us to several cases which, in effect, hold that under such circumstances appellee could not acquire a pre-emption homestead under the law. These decisions we understand to be based upon our statute in reference to this last named class of claimants.
Before any one can acquire a pre-emption homestead under our statute, he is required to make affidavit “ that he is without any homstead of his own” (Revised Statutes, article 3939); and under this statute it has several times been held, that one who already has a homestead is not entitled to acquire other land by pre-emption. Gambrell v. Steele, 55 Texas, 582; Daughty v. Hall, 59 Texas, 518; Garrison v. Grant, 57 Texas, 602. No such requirement, however, is made of actual settlers who are given the prior right to purchase county school land by the section of our Constitution cited above. This section provides: “Each county may sell or dispose of its lands, in whole or in part, in manner to be provided by the Commissioners Court of such county. Actual settlers residing on said lands shall be protected in their prior right of purchasing the same to the extent of their settlement, not to exceed 160 acres, at the price fixed by said court, which price shall not include the value of existing improvements made thereon by such settler.”
The letter of our pre-emption statute certainly does not include this class of settlers, nor do we think its spirit includes them. Pre-emption settlers are given their homesteads as a gratuity, but this class of settlers can only acquire the land claimed by them by paying the same price that the Commissioners Court sells to other parties. They are given nothing but the prior right of purchasing, and thereby enabled to save their improvements. It will therefore readily be seen that reasons exist why those owning lands should not be allowed to acquire homesteads upon the public land which would not exist in the case of those given the prior right to purchase from the counties, and we are of opinion that the fact that appellee may have been entitled to a homestead upon other land was not a bar to her becoming an actual settler upon this land within the meaning of our Constitution.
In her second assignment of error appellant complains, that judgment was rendered for appellee for 160 acres, when the evidence showed that she had only settled upon 80 acres, but we are of opinion that the judgment in this respect is correct. In Perego v. White, 77 Texas, 196, it is said: “We think it follows, therefore, that a purchaser of school lands from a county, upon which an actual settler is residing, who has not been afforded an opportunity to buy, takes it subject to his privilege of pre-emption, and that the settler, upon a tender with reasonable promptness of the value of the land upon which he has settled, estimated upon the basis of the price actually paid or agreed to be paid for the whole tract bought of the county, may demand a conveyance of 160 acres, or a less amount as he may elect.” We do not believe it was the intention of the framers of the Constitution to limit an actual settler in such case to the land he might actually have enclosed at the time of the sale by the county, but the language relied upon by appellant was intended to restrict this prior right of purchasing to 160 acres, even though the settler might have had a greater quantity enclosed.
In her third assignment of error appellant complains of the judgment rendered in the court below, because neither the pleadings of appellee nor the evidence shows the relative value of the 160 acres adjudged to her when compared with the whole four leagues purchased by Buffington, McDaniel, and Baker from the county. It must be conceded that this is a close question; but we are of opinion, that inasmuch as the sale by the county was made by the acre, without reference to any difference in its value, and inasmuch as appellant interposed no exception to the pleadings of appellee upon this ground, and offered no evidence to show that there was a difference in the value of the land, the court did not err in holding the tender made by appellee sufficient, and fixing the amount to be paid by her at its proportion of the price at which the whole tract had been sold. We think this evidence sufficient to sustain the finding of the court that this was its relative value. See Ward v. Worsham, 78 Texas, 180.
We think it has several times, in effect, been held in this State, that a sale made by a County Commissioners Court under the same circumstances that this one was made by the Commissioners Court of Grimes-County was not such a proceeding in rem as to bar the rights of the actual settler, as contended by appellant in her fourth assignment. The Constitution guarantees this right of prior purchase to the actual settler, and the Commissioners Court has no power to deprive her of this right by a proceeding in rem, or any other ex parte proceeding which would have that effect. The Commissioners Court derives its power to make these sales from the same section of the Constitution which guaranteed this •prior right of purchasing to the actual settler, and by this section of the Constitution the right of the court to sell was made subject to the prior right of the settler to purchase. Perego v. White, and Ward v. Worsham, supra; Baker v. Dunning, 77 Texas, 28. As said by us in the case of Baker v. Hillman, this day decided [post, p. 345] “ It seems to us that this proceeding of the Commissioners Court should be regarded rather as an act of agency in the sale of land than the exercise of a judicial function.”
We consider it no longer an open question, that the section of our Constitution quoted above applies to actual settlers who might thereafter enter upon this character of land, as well as to those on it at the time of its adoption. Baker v. Dunning, 77 Texas, 28.

216222,Meade & Bomar v. Mahlon Bartlett et al.,1892-11-15,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This writ of error is a companion case to H. T. Buse v. Mahlon Bartlett et al., No. 16, this day decided by us. The other section of land mentioned in the conclusions of fact in that case is the subject of controversy in this suit.' In this case the possession of the land in controversy was continued in plaintiffs in error up to the institution of the suit and the trial in the court below. In other respects the facts disclosed by the record in this, so far as they are important to the issues determined, are identical with those in said cause No. 16, and the conclusions of law and fact filed in that case are here referred to and adopted as our conclusions of law and fact in this case.
The judgment of the court below will therefore be reversed and judgment will be here rendered for plaintiffs in error.
Reversed and rendered.

216285,"The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. J. B. Shearer et al.",1892-11-15,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
September 7, 1886, appellee J. B. Shearer filed this suit in the District Court of Tarrant County against the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company. Afterward, on December 6, 1886, Ricker, Lee & Co., a firm of contractors composed of N. H. Ricker, F. L. Lee, and Joe A. Owens, were, by amended petition, made parties defendant. The suit is for the recovery of damages for the loss of an arm and other serious personal injuries charged to have been sustained by plaintiff while in the service of defendants as a brakeman. The injuries are alleged to have occurred April 7, 1886, while defendants were engaged in constructing and operating a line of railway at or near Coleman Junction, in this State, and are ascribed to the negligence of the defendants in permitting the brake beams of one of the cars to be broken, and in permitting the roadbed of defendant’s track to become uneven and remain unballasted.
The defendant company filed a general denial, and pleaded specially, that the work upon which plaintiff was injured was being done by Ricker, Lee & Co. under an independent contract; that plaintiff was in the employ of Ricker, Lee & Co., and that the railway company had nothing to do with his injury. It filed a cross-bill against Ricker, Lee & Co., alleging that if plaintiff suffered from the negligence of any one, such negligence was chargeable to Ricker, Lee & Co.; and it prayed, if the same should be imputed by operation of law to the defendant company, for judgment against Ricker, Lee & Co.
The defendants, Ricker, Lee & Co., pleaded their privilege to be sued in Galveston County, where they resided. To this plea the court sustained exceptions. They also relied upon the general issue, and especially denied their liability to the railway company, alleging that at the time of the injury complained of by plaintiff, the latter was in the exclusive service of the defendant company. A trial, in November, 1887, resulted in a verdict in the sum of $7500 in favor of the plaintiff against the railway company. Ricker, Lee & Co. were discharged. From the judgment, in accordance with this verdict, the railway company prosecutes this appeal.
On the trial the railway company read in evidence a contract in writing between itself and Ricker, Lee & Co. This instrument set forth the terms on which Ricker, Lee & Co., as contractors, agreed to perform “ all the grading, bridging, tieing, track laying, and stone culvert construction on the Lampasas extension of the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway in the State of Texas, extending from station 3873 to station 5280.” It was shown that the line as far as the last named station had been completed, and that on reaching that point it was desired to extend the road to Ballinger. It was consequently agreed verbally, that the line would be extended by the contractors to Ballinger on the terms and specifications embodied in the written contract, simply substituting places, stations, and lines. The plaintiff was injured while the work was being done on the latter extension. The railway company took the deposition of one F. W. Steber. It offered to read in evidence an interrogatory, and the answer thereto, as follows:
Interrogatory: “.If you have stated before that you were an engineer upon the road, state whether or not you had any control or management over Ricker, Lee & Co. State what your duties were, and what theirs were. State whether or not you controlled or directed the work to be done, or the manner in which they should do it, and the place at which they should work, or was that left to them or to their discretion, under the contract with the company ?’ ’
Answer: “Ricker, Lee & Co. were to build, construct, and complete the road so that it would be accepted by the engineer in chief on its completion. I controlled and directed the work to be done only indirectly and as the manager of the business of my superior. The detail of the work was left to the contractors. The results of the work were what the railway company was after.”
The plaintiff objected to this answer, because it undertook to interpret and construe the written contract read in evidence between Ricker, Lee & Co. and the railway company, and to state the substance thereof. Appellant complains of the action of the court in sustaining this objection. We think that the court was correct. The contract stated the relative duties of the contractors and of the engineer, and the relation of the latter to the former. The interpretation of the witness was but a statement of his opinion or conclusion as to the legal effect of the written contract. This opinion was inadmissible. Purnell v. Gandy, 46 Texas, 191.
The defendant company offered to read in evidence the following cross-interrogatory propounded by plaintiff, and the answer thereto:
Interrogatory: “Is it not a fact that the engineer or conductor in' charge of said train by which plaintiff was injured was carried on the pay rolls of the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company and was paid by said company ?”
Answer: “ I did not so understand it. He was acting both as engineer and conductor, and my understanding was that he was paid by Ricker, Lee & Co. He was entirely under their direction, and we had nothing at all to do with him. That is, neither myself nor Lynch, nor any one else acting with the railway company, had anything to do with the engineer.”
Objections were made to this answer, because it was not responsive, and because it stated the understanding of the witness as to the legal effect of the contract. That portion of the answer in which the witness refers to his understanding was inadmissible, for reasons already pointed out. The remainder is not responsive and suggests an attempted evasion. An objection on this ground, however, can not be urged for the first time on the trial. It refers to the manner and form of taking the deposition, and advantage can be taken of it only by motion to suppress and notice under the statute. Railway v. Ivy, 71 Texas, 409; Parker v. Chancellor, 78 Texas, 524. The court, therefore, erred in excluding so much of the answer as does not refer to the understanding of the witness. This error, however, does not justify a reversal of the judgment. The witness had testified to the same effect in his direct examination, and the answer was merely cumulative of testimony elsewhere introduced by the railway company through its witness Webster Snyder, that “ the engineer, fireman, and such other employes as may have been connected with the train, were not in the employ or the hire nor under the control of the railway company.”
Appellant’s third assignment of error is as follows:
‘ ■ The court erred in its general charge to the jury, because the same fails to define with particularity the several issues presented in this case as between the plaintiff and the several defendants, and as between the defendants, whereby the jury were misled in the application of the evidence.”
The following is the court’s entire charge, the insertion of which we find necessary in discussing this assignment and subsequent ones:
“ 1. The jury are instructed that it is the duty of those operating a railroad towards those in their employ to exercise reasonable care in keeping the cars used by their employes in safe condition; and if they fail to use such care, and an injury thereby results to the employe while in the discharge of his employment, not caused by his own negligence, the cmployer would be liable for such injury.
‘ ‘ 2. You are further instructed that when a person enters the service of. those operating a railroad, he thereby assumes all the ordinary risks incident to the employment undertaken, and is required to exercise that degree of care which a person of ordinary prudence, acting under like circumstances, would use to avoid injury, and the care required is proportioned to the known condition of the road and cars operated.
“3. If you believe from the evidence that the plaintiff at the time of the alleged injuries was in the employment of the defendant the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway Company, and that he was by the direction of the agents of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway Company engaged in work in which he was injured, and that the injury resulted from or was caused by the defective brake beam of a car which he was attempting to couple, and that the plaintiff was himself at the time acting in a prudent, careful manner, then you should find for the plaintiff as against the defendant the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company; and if you find that he was so injured without his fault, by reason of a defective brake beam of a car, and that at the time the said cars were being operated by both defendants, then you should find for him against all the defendants; but unless you believe from the evidence that at the time of the alleged injury the plaintiff was in the employ of said Ricker, Lee & Co., lie would not be entitled to recover of said Ricker, Lee & Co.
“4. If, however, you believe'from the evidence that the injury to the plaintiff resulted from a want of that care which a person of ordinary prudence would have used under like circumstances, and with the plaintiff’s knowledge of the condition of said cars, or if such negligence on his part contributed to the injury, then you should find for the defendants, notwithstanding you may believe that the track and car, or either, were in an unsafe condition.
“5. If you believe from the evidence that the plaintiff was injured by reason of a defective car, without his fault, and if you further believe that at the time of the alleged injury the said car was being operated by the defendants Ricker, Lee & Co. in construction of an extension of the road, and not by the defendant company, and that at the time of the alleged injury the plaintiff was in the employ of said Ricker, Lee & Co., then you should find for the plaintiff against said Ricker, Lee & Co., and for the defendant company.
“6. If under the foregoing instructions you should find for the plaintiff against the defendant company, and if you further believe from the evidence that the said Ricker, Lee & Co., by contract with the defendant company, undertook to build the road from Coleman Junction to Ballinger, and if you further believe from the evidence that as between said Ricker, Lee & Co. and the defendant company it was agreed that said Ricker, Lee & Co. were to employ the brakemen necessary to operate trains or cars used in constructing the road, and that the plaintiff was injured while a train was being made up under the direction of Ricker, Lee & Co., for their own use, and that the injury resulted from a defective brake beam on one of the cars so used, and if you further believe that by the terms of such verbal contract the said Ricker, Lee & Co. were to keep the cars used by them in repair, then you should find for the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company against said Ricker, Lee & Co. for the amount so awarded against the company.
“7. If you believe from the evidence that by a verbal contract between the defendant company and said Ricker, Lee & Co. it was agreed that the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway Company were to furnish said Ricker, Lee & Co. with engines, cars, and train men necessary in the construction of said road, and that said railway company had and exercised the right to employ and discharge those operating the construction trains, and to change engines and cars used by said Ricker, Lee & Co., then said Ricker, Lee & Co. would not be responsible to said company for any injury resulting from a defect of said cars or machinery, in the event a verdict should be rendered against said company.
“8. If under the foregoing instructions you should find for the plaintiff against the defendants, or either of them, you will assess his damages at such an amount as you believe would fairly, reasonably, and justly compensate him for the injury sustained, considering the mental and physical suffering caused by such injury and his diminished ability to earn money resulting therefrom.
“You are the exclusive judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the testimony.”
This charge, under fair construction, does not impress us as being subject to the criticism of appellant. In the first, second, and fourth paragraphs, the jury are pertinently instructed as to what constitutes negli ■ gence on the part of a railroad company, on the degree of care resting on the employe, and on the effect of contributory negligence. Granting that the plaintiff was the victim of negligence in some manner, the remaining issues arise out of the inquiry, Who was guilty of the negligence ? This, in turn, begets the question, In whose employ was the plaintiff ? The latter charges that he was in the employ of both defendants.
Ricker, Lee & Co. deny that he was in their service, and assert that he was in the exclusive employment of the railway company, by virtue of a verbal agreement by which the latter retained exclusive control over the cars and trainmen. Hence, paragraphs three and seven of the charge.
The railway company denied that the plaintiff was in their service, alleging that he was in the employ of Ricker, Lee & Co. Hence, paragraph five. Again, the defendant company charges, that if, as between it and the plaintiff, it was chargeable with negligence, nevertheless Ricker, Lee & Co. were responsible to it per force of the verbal agreement to keep in repair cars used by them, including the car on which plaintiff was injured. Hence, paragraph six of the charge. It thus appears that the court adapted its instructions to every issue in the case. If there was any defect, it was one of omission purely, which the plaintiff should have sought to supply by request for special instructions. Railway v. Helm, 64 Texas, 147.
These remarks are also applicable to appellant’s fourth assignment of error, in which it complains of the failure of the court to interpret the contract between the defendant railway company and Ricker, Lee & Co. for the construction of the railway, and to instruct the jury as to the legal effect of the contract upon the rights of the several parties. Having failed to ask for such interpretation by means of a special charge, no heed will be given to such complaint urged for the first time in this court. Endick v. Endick, 61 Texas, 559; Ins. Co. v. Ende, 65 Texas, 118.
Appellant, in its tenth, eleventh, and twelfth assignments of error, complains of the court’s refusal to give its second, third, and fourth special instructions, as follows:
“ 2. If you should believe from the evidence that the engineer Russ and the fireman Lambka had been in the employ of the railway company, and were sent by them to run the train for Ricker, Lee & Co., and while carried on the pay roll of the company were paid by it, but that the same was charged to Ricker, Lee & Co. by agreement and paid by them, then you are instructed that the legal effect of the same would be to make said Russ and Lambka employes of Ricker, Lee & Co., and not of this defendant.
“ 3. The mere fact, if it be a fact', that the plaintiff and his coemployes, Russ and Lambka, had been regular employes of the railway company, and were sent to Coleman Junction by it to act as brakeman, engineer, and fireman, respectively, on the train controlled and operated by Ricker, Lee & Co. m the construction of the road under their contract, would not make them employes of the railway company if they were actually paid by Ricker, Lee & Co. m person or through the agency of the railway company, and the railway company would not owe the plaintiff any obligation as an employe.
“4. If you believe from the evidence that the railway company made a contract with Ricker, Lee & Co. to build the road from Coleman Junction to Ballinger, and agreed to lease them an engine and cars for the purpose of using the same in the construction of said railway, and further agreed to deliver them material at Coleman Junction, and that the railway company did deliver to them the car which ran over the plaintiff, and that the railway company sent them the engineer, fireman, and brakeman, and kept the engineer and fireman on its pay roll, and that while said engineer and fireman were coupling up a train on the spur track to carry out materials for the said Ricker, Lee & Co., and under their instructions, the said plaintiff was hurt through a defective brake beam upon a car which he was trying to couple to another, and you should further believe that said engineer and fireman who ran said train were being paid by Ricker, Lee & Co., through the agency of the railway company, for the convenience of said Ricker, Lee & Co., and were then doing their work, then you will find a verdict for the railway company, no matter what verdict you may return as to the other defendants, Ricker, Lee & Co.”
These charges were properly rejected.
The second instruction is founded upon evidence in the record that Russ and Lambka, the engineer and fireman operating the train in connection with which the plaintiff was injured, were carried upon the pay rolls of the railway company for the convenience of the contractors, and would be paid their regular wages by the company, the amount being repaid at the end of each month by Ricker, Lee & Co. This was not the only evidence, however, bearing upon the relation of these employes. The testimony introduced by Ricker, Lee & Co. was to the effect that the train men, including the plaintiff, the engineer, and the fireman, were selected by the company, and subject alone to be discharged by it. This testimony is ignored in the charge asked. It might, therefore, have been construed by the jury as indicating an opinion by the court that the fact in the special charge referred to should alone determine ,the relation of the parties mentioned. It is not proper for the court to cull from the body of conflicting evidence special features that may be favorable to the one litigant or the other, emphasizing their weight in its instructions.
The second and third special instructions are subject to a similar criticism. The former seems to make the payment of wages the sole test of responsibility; the latter the existence of the contract between appellant and Ricker, Lee & Co.; both ignoring other material evidence bearing upon the controlling question, In whose service was the plaintiff at the time ? The real test for the answer to which is, To whose orders and control was the plaintiff subject, and by whom was he liable to be discharged ? Wood on Mast, and Serv., sec. 317.
Appellant in its fifth assignment complains of the third paragraph of the court’s charge, already set out. It is insisted that the concluding clause of the charge is misleading, to the prejudice of appellant, because it limits the right of plaintiff to recover against Ricker, Lee & Co. to his being in their employ.
The plaintiff’s petition shows that his cause of action against Ricker, Lee & Co. is founded upon the fact of such employment. He charges that he was in the employment of both parties; that he was their servant, and that as his masters they were guilt)' of negligence towards him. Unless, therefore, he was in the employment of Ricker, Lee & Co., he was not entitled to a verdict against them. The charge conforms to the case made by the pleadings, and is correct.
Appellant assigns as error the refusal of the court to give its eighth special instruction, as follows:
“ The plaintiff alleges in this case that he received his injuries from a defect in a brake beam and its connections, etc., and through defect in the track by reason of it being unsurfaced; and if the evidence should prove to you that the brake beam was out of order and that the track was not surfaced, and that the injury to plaintiff was the result of these two causes combined, and not to the defective brake beam alone, and you should also believe from the evidence that this unsurfaced condition of the track was familiar to the plaintiff, and had been known to him before he undertook to make the coupling at the time of the injury to him, then 3'ou will find for the defendants.”
We do not think that this instruction embodies the law. When there are concurrent causes of an injury, each of which contributes thereto, the fact that one of the causes might have been avoided by the plaintiff, or that with reference to it he might have been guilty of. contributory negligence, will not exempt the company as to the other cause. Railway v. Somers, 78 Texas, 439. Such we take to be a corollary from the doctrine announced in Railway v. Cummings, 106 U. S., 266. It is there held that “ if the negligence of the company contributed to — that is to sa3r, had a share in — producing the injury, the company is liable, even though the negligence of the fellow servant is contributory also.” Besides, the charge was to the effect that knowledge on the part of the plaintiff of the unballasted condition of the track would suffice to render him guilty of contributory negligence. This, in our opinion, is not the law. Wood Mast, and Serv., secs. 357-359. The question of contrib-' utory negligence on the part of one occupying the position of plaintiff was for the jury. Id., sec. 159.
In its sixteenth assignment of error appellant complains of the court’s refusal to give its sixth special instruction, as follows:
“ If you should believe from the evrdence that Ricker, Lee & Co. were controlling the cars and the train, in the coupling of which plaintiff was hurt, and you should believe from the evidence that there was a defective brake beam upon one of the cars which caused the injury to the plaintiff; and you should also believe that said cars were placed upon the side or spur track by the railway company, loaded with materials for the use of Ricker, Lee & Co., and that said car was being moved out by Ricker, Lee & Co., or was being prepared to be moved out in the train controlled by Ricker, Lee & Co., and that by contract said Ricker, Lee <& Co. were to repair all cars in their use, then you are instructed that the railway company owed no duty to the plaintiff to furnish Ricker, Lee & Co. with a perfect car, and incurred no liability to him by reason of any defect in such car, and you will find a verdict for the said railway company against the plaintiff.”
The evidence relied upon b3r the plaintiff, as well as that introduced by Ricker, Lee & Co., was to the effect that the relation of master and servant existed between appellee and the railway company. If such was the case, the duty of the company to the appellee could not be affected by the contract between it and Ricker, Lee & Co., to which the appellee was not a party. The charge requested was wholly ignored by the evidence referred to, and was correctly refused.
Appellant insists that the court should have set aside the verdict of the j ury because it was contrary to the fifth and sixth paragraphs of the court’s charge already set out. The statement of facts is quite voluminous, and we do not feel called upon to critically dissect it. Suffice it to say, that it was conflicting on the issues embodied in the paragraphs referred to. The finding of the jury on each issue involved in its verdict is supported by sufficient testimony, and we do not feel authorized to disturb it.
Delivered November 15, 1892.
Appellant’s eighteenth and final assignment of error complains that the court erred in overruling its amended motion for a new trial. This motion is supported by affidavits of divers persons (with one exception employes of the defendant company), setting up facts within their knowledge in conflict with the testimony of the plaintiff and of Owens, a member of the firm of Ricker, Lee & Co. The motion is founded upon the statement by appellant’s counsel that they were surprised by the testimony of these witnesses. We do not think that the application shows ground for surprise. The testimony of these witnesses is addressed to issues clearly indicated by their pleading, the purpose of which was to enable the defendant to be prepared with testimony to disprove its allegations. It is not claimed that the testimony.referred to in the affidavits was newly discovered, that it was unknown to appellant at the time of the trial, or that the witnesses could not have been had at the trial. No effort was made by appellant to withdraw its announcement, but it proceeded, taking its chances for a verdict on the evidence already introduced by it. There was no abuse of judicial discretion in overruling the motion. Kilgore v. Jordan, 17 Texas, 346; Dotson v. Moss, 58 Texas, 156.
The judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed.
Motion for rehearing refused."
219163,E. R. Stiff et al. v. J. J. Fisher,1893-02-07,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This suit was brought by J. J. Fisher against E.R. Stiff, as principal, and Gabe Beck, as guarantor, to recover the sum of $10,200, on account of the alleged failure of Stiff to deliver to Fisher 2000 head of. yearling steers, as provided in a contract entered into between them on the 21st day of December, 1889. By the terms of' this contract these cattle were to be delivered about the 20th day of April,. 1890, at or near Valley View, in Cooke County, Texas, after being classed and passed upon at Stiff’s ranch in Collin and Denton counties; but to be-counted at Valley View. The steers were to be a good, smooth lot of merchantable cattle, free from defects, and of full age .at the time of delivery; and were to be bought in Collin, Grayson, Ellis, and Dallas counties. The price agreed upon was $7 per head, to be paid as follows: $4000 cash (which was paid), $3000 about the 10th of January, 1890 (which was also paid), and the balance at the time of delivery.
This contract was made by J. J. Fisher, through his agent, P. S. Witherspoon, who was to drive the cattle from the Stiff ranch, but Fisher was not to be responsible for losses until after they were counted at Valley View. A further advance payment of $1200 was afterwards made, under circumstances which, if, appellee’s witnesses be deemed credible, would warrant the inference that the money was obtained by falsely representing or fraudulently concealing material facts on the part of Stiff.
No cattle having been delivered on or before April 20, 1890, appelleesued to recover the money paid on the contract and the difference between the contract price and the market value, in the total sum above named. Attachment writs were sued out at the same time, to-wit, on the 22d day of April, 1890, upon the grounds, (1) that Stiff had disposed of liis property with intent to defraud his creditors, and (2) that the debt sued for was due for money obtained under false pretenses. The cattle of Stiff in Grayson, Collin, and Denton counties were levied on under these attachments and replevied by him. The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee for $9200, and from the judgment approving this verdict this appeal was taken.
1. Appellant Stiff moved to quash the attachment, because the same was based upon a claim for unliquidated damages. The overruling of this motion being assigned as error, presents the first question for determination.
Near the beginning of the present century Mr. Justice Washington, of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Fisher v. Consequa (2 Wash., 384), in construing the attachment statute of Pennsylvania, in which the words “ debt” and “ demand” occur, while recognizing that in strict law language “ debt” is a precise sum due by express agreement, announced the proposition, “ that the uncertainty of the sum due does not, in the common understanding of mankind, render it less a debt.” That was a case of contract, by which the defendant bound himself to deliver the plaintiff teas of a certain quality and suited to a certain market; and on failure to do so, to pay the difference between teas of such quality and such as should be delivered. In sustaining an attachment sued out to recover the difference, he uses this language: “A promise, whether express or implied, to pay as much as certain goods or labor are worth, or as much as the same kind of goods may sell for on a certain day or at a certain market, or to pay the difference between the value of one kind of goods and another, creates, in common parlance, a debt.” In determining whether the attachment should issue, he applied this test: The demand must arise out of a contract, without which no debt can be created, and the measure of the damages must be such as the plaintiff can aver by affidavit to be due.
These principles have been applied in many subsequent cases, though the decisions are not uniform. Drake on Attach., secs. 12-23. It is true, in that case there was an express promise to pay this difference; while in the case here submitted there was but an implied promise to pay the difference between the contract price and market value at the time and place of delivery. In some of the cases, however, cited by Mr. Drake above, there was no express promise.
We are of opinion that the words “ debt” and “ demand,” as used in our attachment statute, should not be so restricted in their meaning and scope as appellants contend, and that no error was committed in overruling the motion to quash the attachment. While a strict compliance on the part of the attaching creditor with the statute has been steadily enforced in this State, it seems to us that in construing the meaning of the law itself, to adopt an illiberal rule is to disregard the expressed will of the Legislature. Rev. Stats., Final Title, sec. 3; see, also, Hochstadler Bros. v. Sam, 73 Texas, 315; Wilson v. Wilson, 50 Am. Dec., 685; And. Law Die., 315; 1 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law., 986.
2. Another defense interposed by appellants is, that about the 1st of April, 1890, a new contract was entered into between the parties, materially changing, and abrogating to the extent of the changes, the old one. We find from the evidence, that about the date named Stiff and P. S. Weatherspoon, as agent for Fisher, and also for J. R. Stevens, who had a similar contract for the delivery of 1500 cattle, in view of the fact that Stiff had a part of the cattle ready for delivery, and that Fisher and Stevens were desirous of receiving them earlier than the date specified in the original contracts, agreed that Stiff might, instead of making one delivery of all the cattle about the 20th of April, deliver 1500 or 2000 of them on the 10th of April and the rest on the 1st of May; and that the cattle should be counted at Stiff’s ranch instead of Valley View, upon Stiff’s furnishing the pens and fuel necessary for branding the cattle. The parties made preparation to deliver and receive the cattle in accordance with this arrangement. To this end one R. M. Sloan and Chris. Brooks, in the employ of Fisher and Stevens, under the direction of Witherspoon, proceeded at once with their men and horses to the ranch of Stiff, in Den-ton County, to brand and receive the cattle.
Appellants complain that the court refused to give their requested instruction, to the effect that if the jury should find that the contract sued on was afterwards so altered and changed ■ that a different period of delivery was agreed on, and said subsequent agreement was afterwards relied upon and accepted by the parties in substitution of the original agreement, to find for the defendants. The court charged, in effect, of which complaint is made, that the substituted contract as alleged by defendants would not prevent the plaintiff from maintaining his action upon the original contract, unless it appeared that the new contract had in fact been performed by defendant, or that he was ready, willing, and able to perform the same according to its terms; and to find for defendant in the event defendant had offered to perform his part of the new contract, and was ready, willing, and able to do so.
It seems to us that the exact time and place of the delivery were not of the essence of the original contract, which provided that the delivery should be made at or near Valley View, and about the 20th day of April. These slight changes as to details in executing the original contract seem to us to have been made by the parties for their mutual convenience, in subordination to its main purpose. Without going into the questions of accord and satisfaction and accord without satisfaction, so ably discussed by counsel, we have reached the conclusion, that unless Stiff was ready, willing, and able to avail himself of the privilege of the first delivery at his ranch in Denton County, he could not insist upon the right of the second delivery at the same place and at a later date. Under the evidence in this case, it must be held, we think, that the verdict of the jury, which is supported thereby, imports a finding that Stiff intentionally broke his contract with Fisher. These conclusions dispose of the eleventh, thirteenth, and fourteenth assignments.
3. The second assignment of error complains of the admission in evidence of the contracts of one Stevens, made through his agent, P. S. Witherspoon, about the same time and of similar impprt, to-wit, for the delivery of 1500 head of cattle at the same time and place. Stiff having failed, up to the 22d of April, 1890, to deliver any cattle under either contract, attempted to prove on the trial of this case that he had more cattle ready to deliver than was required to fill the Fisher contract. We think it was compentent for appellee to prove in rebuttal, or even as original evidence in developing his case, that Stiff had obligated himself to deliver cattle at the same time and place in fulfillment of the Stevens contract also. In fact, Witherspoon was the common agent of Fisher and Stevens, and the transactions were too intimately blended to fully investigate the one without acquiring knowledge of the other. The scope of this evidence was properly limited, as shown in the court’s explanation appended to the bill of exceptions, and the reasons there stated for its admission seem to us to be entirely sufficient.
4. The fourth assignment of error challenges the correctness of the court’s ruling in admitting testimony to prove the market value of the class of cattle called for in the contract in Cooke County generally, instead of limiting it to the value at Valley View. It was shown that there was no market at Valley View different from the market in the county generally; and it seems, therefore, clear to us, that as Valley View was a part of Cooke County, the market value of the county was a proper consideration for the jury. Certainly the proof offered showed the market value “ near,” if not “ at,” Valley View, which was all the contract required.
5. Complaint is made of the court’s action in giving and refusing charges in respect to a certain mortgage executed by Stiff, in favor of the First National Bank of McKinney, on the cattle in Question, to secure an indebtedness of 113,000. The requested instruction, insisted upon as correct by the ninth assignment of error, contains the proposition, that if the debt secured by this mortgage was real and not fictitious, the jury should have been instructed that the giving of this mortgage was not a fraudulent disposition of property. It is clear to us that this charge, if given, would have withdrawn from the jury the consideration whether or not the instrument was in fact executed with a fraudulent intent. The eighth assignment insists, that the court should have instructed the jury that the mortgage of the McKinney bank, if taken with the knowledge of and for money furnished to complete the contract sued upon, would be inferior and subordinate to Fisher’s right to said cattle under Ms contract, and that a seizure by the bank under sequestration proceedings would be subordinate to Fisher’s rights. We are not prepared to say, under the facts contained in this record, that this charge correctly states the law as applicable thereto, and are also of opinion that the charge of the court complained of in the fifteenth assignment on this subject was not erroneous.
6. The third assignment of error reads as follows: “ The court erred in permitting plaintiff to introduce in evidence the declarations and acts of one Mangum, in order to bind defendant Stiff by same, over objections of defendants, * * * and in refusing to exclude such testimony, upon motion of defendants.” This testimony was, in substance, that one Mangum met witness Jim Witherspoon on the 22d day of December, 1890, at Pilot Point; introduced himself, and stated that Stiff had sent him from McKinney to tell them that they (the Witherspoons) could not take the cattle without paying the $13,000 mortgage claimed by the McKinney bank; also, that said Mangum came to R. M. Sloan on that day, but prior thereto, at Sloan’s camp, and asked for Witherspoon; that he said he had come from McKinney and had a message from Captain Stiff for Wither-spoon, stating that Witherspoon could not take the cattle, as he would hot lift the mortgage; also, that on the 23d day of April, 1890, said Man-gum met Chris Brooks at the pasture, and endeavored to drive seventy-five or eighty head of the cattle from the Denton County pasture through the gate into the Collin County pasture, which attempt was prevented by witness; that said Mangum claimed to represent Stiff in finding out whether the cattle were attached. One of the objections to this testimony was, that there was no proof of the agency or authority of said Mangum in making such statements or doing such acts, save his own declarations, which were insufficient to prove agency. The purpose of this testimony seems to have been to show a collusion between the McKinney bank and Stiff; and that Stiff, instead of complying with his contract in good faith, was endeavoring to use the mortgage of the McKinney bank as an obstruction to the fulfillment of his engagement. It will be seen, therefore, that the testimony was of a material character.
That the acts and declarations of the agent are inadmissible to establish agency is elementary. It is not required, however, that the proof of agency be full and satisfactory before such acts and declarations are admissible. If competent evidence has first been introduced tending to prove the agency, the acts and declarations of the agent, if otherwise competent, may be admitted, as it is the province of the jury to pass upon the sufficiency of the proof .upon this as well as other issues of fact. Mech. on Ag., sec. 106.
No complaint is made of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, nor of the failure of the court to instruct the jury to disregard these acts and declarations in case the authority to make them was not •otherwise shown.
The only question then for us to pass upon is, did the evidence tend to show that Stiff sent Mangum with a message to Witherspoon ? The circumstances seemed to demand of him that he should at least send a representative to meet Witherspoon at Pilot Point on that day, as he failed to return himself, according to promise made on the previous day. He admits that he did send Mangum, but denies that it was for this purpose. In other respects his testimony was contradicted by some of the witnesses. The circumstances.tended to show, if appellee’s witnesses were credible, that it was more reasonable and probable that Mangum was sent with a message to Witherspoon oh that day than to carry money to a ranchman, as claimed by Stiff. The judge trying the case, with the witnesses before him, concluded that there was evidence tending to support appellee’s theory on this point; and we are not prepared to hold that in this there was error. As the testimony of Mangum, though a nonresident, was not produced, and no attempt was made to procure it, we have hesitated much in approving this ruling.
7. The plea in reconvention contains a traverse of the two grounds upon which the attachment was sued out. Upon the issue thus raised as to the truthfulness of the ground that the debt was due for money obtained under false pretenses, appellants requested the following charge, which was refused: “If you believe from the evidence that plaintiff J. J. Fisher advanced to defendant E. E. Stiff the sum of $1200, which money was obtained by false pretenses made by Stiff, and the remainder of the money advanced by plaintiff was not obtained in such way, then you are instructed, that the obtaining of such money in such way would not justify the charge made in the affidavit that the money sued for was obtained under false pretenses.” The evidence clearly called for this charge, if it be the law that an attachment is wrongfully sued out on this ground where only a part of the debt is due for property obtained under false pretenses. This question seems, so far as our research has gone, never to have been raised before, and must therefore be disposed-of without the benefit of precedent. It seems to us an attachment in such ■case is permitted*by the statute only to secure the debt, and none other, due for the property so obtained, and that an affidavit, for instance, which alleges that a debt of $10,000' is due for property obtained under false pretenses, where only about one-tenth of the debt is due for property obtained in that way, must be held to be not only literally but substantially false; and that a seizure of a debtor’s property to secure so large a sum is wrongful, unless upon some other ground the attachment is lawfully sued out.
We are therefore constrained to hold that for this error alone the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered February 7, 1893.
Pending a motion for rehearing, the opinion of the Supreme Court was-had upon certified question as to whether the trial court should have given the requested charge, relating to the affidavit for attachment, as set forth in the last paragraph of the foregoing opinion. Stiff v. Fisher,. 85 Texas, 556. Motion overruled."
216175,E. L. Dohoney v. W. O. Womack et al.,1892-11-22,"GARRETT, Presiding Judge, Section B.
Plaintiffs brought this suit as the heirs of John D. Womack, Jr., and Archie Womack, to recover of the defendant, E. L. Dohoney, a two-tliirds interest in a tract of 825-J acres of land of the S. M. Fulton survey, in Lamar County. They pleaded their title, deriving it from one W. W. Stell; recognized an interest of one-third of the land in the defendant as the grantee of Mrs. Mollie E. Pass, one of the heirs of John D. Womack, Jr., and Archie Womack; alleged that the deed of conveyance from W. W. Stell to John D. Womack, Sr., had been lost or mislaid; and that the defendant claimed the entire tract under an after deed from Stell, which inured to their benefit as well as his own.
The defendant answered, that he had purchased certain portions of the land at tax sales; that he had bought 65 acres from one McCuistion; that he had purchased the entire tract from the said Mollie E. Pass and her husband, and that he had procured a deed therefor from the said W. W. Stell, which conveyed to the defendant a legal and equitable title, because no deed had ever been executed from Stell to the said John D. Womack, Sr.
The case was tried without a jury, and resulted in a judgment for the plaintiffs for two-thirds of the land, and a decree of partition. Defendant has appealed, and has assigned errors for which he seeks a reversal of the judgment of the court below.
The court’s findings of fact were as follows:
“1. That W. W. Stell had a valid title to all the land described in plaintiffs’ petition, and that plaintiffs and defendant claim through him as a common source.
“ 2. That W. W. Stell bargained and sold the said- land in 1864 to John D. Womack, Sr., and received the purchase money therefor, and that afterward, about 1867 or 1868, he executed a deed to said Womack for said land, which deed is lost.
“ 3. That on April 21, 1868, John D. Womack, Sr., by deed, sold and conveyed said land to Wm. H. Womack.
“4. That on the 23d day of February, 1870, Wm. H. Womack, by deed, conveyed said land to John D. Womack, Jr., and Archie Womack.
“5. That plaintiffs and Mrs. Mollie E. Pass are the sole surviving heirs of Archie and John D. Womack, Jr., and that as such plaintiffs inherited an undivided two-tliirds interest and Mrs. Mollie E. Pass an undivided one-third interest in and to said land.
“ 6. That on the 4th day of December, 1885, Mrs. Mollie E. Pass, joined by her husband, conveyed by deed all her interest in said land to E. L. Dohoney, the defendant.
“ 7. That in June, 1887, W. W. Stell executed a quitclaim deed to the defendant, without any consideration except as recited therein, to-wit, the purpose to supply the lost deed from Stell to John D. Womack, Sr., mentioned in No. 2 of the preceding findings.”
There is also a statement of facts in the record.
W. W. Stell acquired his title to the land by deed from B. F. Mc-Cuistion, as administrator of his wife Mary McCuistion, deceased. This deed was admitted in evidence over the objection of the defendant, without proof of the proceedings in the Probate Court ordering the sale and confirmation thereof. A bill of exceptions was taken and the action of the court assigned as error. The subsequent introduction of the same deed by the defendant was a waiver of the error in its admission in behalf of the plaintiffs. Again, as Stell was common source, it can not be seen how the error was material, if it was error at all.
In order to lay the predicate for the introduction of secondary evidence to prove the contents of the alleged lost deed from W. W. Stell to John D. Womack, Sr., witnesses were permitted by the court to testify on the stand as to the execution and loss of such a deed, without a preliminary affidavit. The evidence of a witness on the stand may suffice instead of such affidavit. Parks v. Caudle, 58 Texas, 220; Trimble v. Edwards, 84 Texas, 497. But it is contended that the proof of the execution of the deed is not sufficient to sustain the finding of the court.
W. W. Stell, the alleged grantor, testified: “About the year 1864 I sold the land described in plaintiffs’ petition to John D. Womack, Sr. He paid me cash the purchase money, which was about $8000 in Confederate money. I thought until recently that I made him a deed for the land at the time he purchased the same, but recently I have investigated the records, and am now of the opinion that I only then made him.a bond for title, from the fact that McCuistion did not make me a deed until 1867. Until I searched the records I had firmly believed that I had made a deed, and now I have no other reason for believing that the deed was not made than the fact that I failed to find it by such search. I now think that I have made three different deeds to this land.
“Sometime between the 1st day of April, 1867, and the 1st day of April, 1868, F. W. Miner, representing the Womack side of the question, approached me about this land and said his client wanted a deed from me. The matter was satisfactorily settled at that time, and I am confir dent that I made Womack a deed for the land then, though I could not swear positively that I did make it. I am perfectly well satisfied now that I first made a title bond to John D. Womack, Sr., and that I again, in 1867 or 1868, made a deed when approached by F. W. Miner.
“In June, 1887, the defendant, E. L. Dolioney, informed me that no deed was of record from me to John D. Womack, Sr., stating at the same time that he held a fee simple title from all the heirs of said AVomack; said Dolioney thus induced me to sign him a quitclaim deed to supply this loss or lack of recorded deed from me to John D. Womack, Sr. Defendant knew at the time he received this last mentioned deed from me of the former sale to said Womack, and also of the fact that the purchase money had been paid by said AVomack to me. E. L. Dolioney has never paid me anything for said 8251,- acres of land, nor did he pay me anything for said deed. Womack paid me cash for the land, and I have never claimed the land since I sold to him, nor do I now claim any interest in it. It has been known ever since said sale as the Womack .land, and so recognized by me, and I am perfectly satisfied with said sale now.”
The deed from W. W. Stell to E. L. Dohoney recited that, “ for and in consideration of the fact that sometime between April 8, 1867, and April, 1868, for value received, I sold and conveyed the hereinafter described land to John D. Womack, now deceased; and whereas, my deed to said Womack was never recorded and is now lost or mislaid and can not be found; and whereas, E. L. Dohoney is now the owner of said land, by purchase and conveyance from the assignees and surviving heirs of said John D. Womack, deceased; now, therefore, to pass whatever technical or legal title may appear from the record to remain in me to the real and equitable owner, I have granted, sold, and conveyed, and by these presents do grant, bargain, and sell and convey unto the said E. L. Dohoney, and to his heirs and assigns, a certain tract of land,” etc. * * * “ To have and to hold the above described premises, together with all and singular the rights, members, improvements, hereditaments, and appurtenances thereto in any way belonging, unto the said E. L. Dohoney and his heirs and assigns forever, in fee simple; it being understood that this is only a quitclaim deed.”
Dohoney was claiming the land by tax deeds, by a deed from McCuistion for 65 acres out of 100 acres sold to J. W. Wooldridge by Archie Womack, Jr., and by a deed from Mrs. M. E. Pass and husband for their right, title, and interest in the land.
F. W. Miner testified, that in 1867 Womack told him that he had bought the land from Stell for Confederate money, but had no deed or bond for title, and employed witness to procure a deed. The witness detailed negotiations with Stell about getting a deed, and said that the matter was delayed and deferred and no deed was ever executed by Stell to Womack.
Defendant pleaded, that the recital in the deed from Stell to him that a deed had been executed by Stell to Womack and was mislaid or lost was, in fact, untrue, and that the deed from Stell to him invested him with the full legal and equitable title to the land in controversy. The recital in the deed from Stell to Dohoney that a deed had been executed by Stell to Womack was admissible as evidence of that fact. McCutchen v. Purinton, 84 Texas, 603. We think that the finding of the court below that such a deed was executed was supported by the evidence, and that there was sufficient testimony as to its contents.
In announcing its conclusions of law it was stated by the court: “ If the court should be mistaken in its findings that W. W. Stell executed a deed to John D. Womack, Sr., in 1867 or 1868, yet the court is of the opinion that the deed executed by W. W. Stell to the defendant in June, 1887, being made for the purpose of carrying out the original contract made by Stell with John D. Womack in 1864, inures to the benefit of plaintiffs as well as to the defendant, and perfects plaintiffs’ title to an undivided two-thirds interest in the land.” The conveyance was made upon a pre-existing consideration for the purpose of vesting the legal title where Stell supposed it equitably belonged; and if, in fact, Stell had not before executed a deed to Womack for the land, then Dohoney, who took the conveyance with full notice of the rights of Womack, and was himself claiming under him, became the trustee by construction of the legal title for the benefit of himself and the plaintiffs. Soye v. McCallister, 18 Texas, 98. It was not necessary that the transaction should be such as to create a resulting trust, as contended by the appellant under his fourth assignment of error, in order to make the deed inure to the benefit of plaintiffs as well as Dohoney, because a conveyance may be made under such circumstance as would imply a constructive trust; and we think that the circumstances in this case are such as would make it inequitable for the defendant to hold the entire title against the just claim of the plaintiffs, of whose rights he had full notice outside of the recitals in the deed from Stell to him, because he knew that there were in fact other heirs besides Mrs. Pass, who conveyed to him only what interest she had in the land, and procured the deed by representing to Stell that he owned the title of the heirs.
No objection was made to the deed in the court below, that there was not a sufficient consideration shown to support its execution. It has, however, been frequently held that Confederate money was a valuable consideration; and if the land was paid for in 1864 with Confederate money, that would be a sufficient consideration for the execution of the deed after that character of money had become entirely worthless.
There is an assignment of error that the court erred in admitting in evidence the deed of partition by a portion of the heirs of John D. Womack. Whether or not there was error in this matter is immaterial, because title was shown in the heirs without reference to that instrument.
Appellant’s seventh assignment of error relates to the exclusion from the evidence of the deed from Archie Womack to J. W. Wooldridge for 100 acres of the land in controversy, to be taken wherever the grantee might select; and a deed from J. W. Wooldridge to M. H. McCuistion for 65 acres of the 100 acres, and a similar deed from McCuistion to the appellant for the 65 acres. It was error to exclude the Wooldridge deed, because a deed for a given number of acres to be selected from a larger tract is not void for uncertainty. Nye v. Moody, 70 Texas, 434. We do not pass on the admissibility of the other two deeds, as not necessary to a disposition of the case, and the party to be affected by' them is not before the court. As this error will lead to a reversal of the case, it is proper to note that the owner of the remaining 35 acres of the 100 acres will probably be a necessary party to the suit.
The fact that the track of the St. Louis & San Francisco Railway Company ran across the land did not make that company a necessary party; and it was not necessary that the defendant should be in possession of the premises to enable the plaintiffs to. maintain a suit against him.
For the error above indicated, we conclude that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.
Adopted May 24, 1892."
219139,John Parker et al. v. W. A. Adams et al.,1893-02-15,"ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.
Per Curiam.
This appeal was heretofore dismissed because the record disclosed that no final judgment had been entered in the court below.
A tract of land was sued for, and upon a verdict in favor of plaintiffs as to a portion of the defendants and against plaintiffs as to the rest of the defendants, judgment was rendered in accordance therewith. The motion for a new trial filed by plaintiffs was overruled as to a portion of the defendants, who recovered a judgment against plaintiffs, and sustained as to the rest of such defendants. Our conclusion is, that this had the effect of granting a new trial as to all the defendants, and hence that the cause stands on the docket as if there had been no trial. Wootters v. Kauffman, 67 Texas, 488.
The motion for rehearing will therefore be overruled.
Overruled.
Delivered February 15, 1893."
219225,J. B. Watkins v. T. D. Hill et al.,1893-02-16,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
The land in controversy is in one tract, patented to Robert Hill on the 24th day of September, 1853, on his headriglit certificate, and is situated about thirteen miles a little northwest from Clarksville, in Red River County. There is also another survey of 800 acres, patented on the same day by virtue of the same certificate, known as the Robert Hill survey, and situated about ten miles northwest from Clarksville. Pecan Bayou runs through the last named tract, and the land in controversy is about one mile from said bayou.
On the 12th day of February, 1853, the then sheriff of Red River County, under an execution issued out of the Justice Court for precinct number 4, sold to James C. Brown and William A. Park a tract of land which is described in the deed as follows: “A certain tract or parcel of land consisting of 640 acres, more or less, as the property of Robert Hill, .situated as follows: On the waters of Pecan Bayou, about eight miles northwest from Clarksville, surveyed on the headright certificate of Robert Hill.”
The court below found that the judgment and execution recited in the deed were duly rendered and issued, the records of said precinct having been destroyed by fire, and the justice and sheriff being both dead.
The suit in the court below was by appellees as heirs of Robert Hill, as plaintiffs, against appellant, who claims under the sheriff’s deed, as defendant. The court below held the sheriff’s deed insufficient to pass title to this land, and rendered judgment in favor of appellees, from which this appeal is prosecuted.
It does not appear from the statement of facts that the land has ever been in the actual possession of any one, nor was any evidence introduced to show any assertion of claim on the part of appellant or his vendors to this particular tract of land under the sheriff’s deed about the time of its execution, nor that they had ever paid taxes thereon; nor is there any evidence in the record that the patentee, Hill, or those claiming under him, ever recognized this sale.
From the brief of appellant, it would seem that the court below rendered judgment in favor of appellees upon the ground that the description of the land in the sheriff’s deed was, upon its face, insufficient to pass title, and was therefore void; but from a careful examination of the record, we do not understand the conclusions of the court to be based entirely upon this ground. It seems that the deed was admitted in evidence, and paroi evidence was allowed to aid in identifying the land conveyed. The evidence offered, however, went only to the extent of showing that there were two surveys in that county patented upon the same-certificate; that one of these surveys contains 640 acres, the amount called for in the sheriff’s deed, and was about thirteen miles instead of eight miles northwest from Clarksville, and was about one mile from Pecan Bayou; while the other survey contained 800 acres, and was about"" ten miles instead of eight miles northwest from Clarksville, and Pecan Bayou,, called for in the deed, runs through it.
As shown in the conclusions of fact, no attempt was made to show that the land in controversy was in fact surveyed at the time of the execution of the sheriff’s deed, nor that there had been an assertion of claim to this land under such deed dating back to about the time of its execution. No-attempt was made to account for the failure to introduce the surveyor’s records to show that this particular land had in fact been surveyed at the time of the levy, so as to authorize the court to presume such to have-been the case, as required by repeated decisions in this State. Ruby v. Von Valkenberg, 72 Texas, 459; Tucker v. Murphy, 66 Texas, 360.
We believe if appellant claimed that the land patented September 24, 1853, was the land which was conveyed by the sheriff’s deed in February, 1853, it was incumbent upon him to show that at the time of the levy of the execution this land had been located, so as to show that the defendant in execution had at that time such title as was subject to levy and sale; and that this evidence was also material to aid in identifying-the land in controversy as being that referred to in the deed; and as the-necessary evidence was not offered to authorize the court to supply this-omission by presumption, there was no error in holding that the evidence was not sufficient to show that the land in controversy passed by the sheriff’s deed.
It has several times been held, that limitation will run only from the date of the patent, unless the date of the location affirmatively appears-from the record; and where it is attempted to hold under a sheriff’s deed land which was sold for the insignificant price of 2-J cents per acre, the-consideration recited in this deed, we think the court would hardly be authorized to hold, in the absence of evidence, that land patented in September had been located in the February preceding, in order to sustain such sale. Wood v. Welder, 42 Texas, 396.
Finding no error in the judgment rendered by the court below, let it be in all things affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered February 16, 1893."
219246,A. C. Buck v. H. C. Morrow,1893-02-16,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
On the 1st day of May, 1886, H. C. Morrow leased to A. C. Buck a certain pasture in Wise County for a term of five years, commencing with that date, for the sum of $125 per year, with the provision, that after the second year, should Morrow have occasion to sell the land, he should compensate Buck for any or all losses occasioned by the sale. It was understood between the parties at the time that the land was being leased by Buck to graze cattle thereon.
At the expiration of two years the land was sold and appellant Buck dispossessed. He offered to prove on the trial by the witness J. L. Campbell, that at the time he was dispossessed he had 140 head of cattle in the pasture, under the charge and control of said Campbell, and that he and Campbell had made diligent inquiry and search for another pasture for the cattle, but failed to find one. That said cattle were turned out of the pasture on the commons, and ran at large on the range for a period of five months before another could be procured. That during the time the cattle were on the range, it required an extra hand to look after and keep them rounded up, at a cost of 81.50 per day, which was a reasonable charge. That all reasonable diligence was used to prevent said cattle from straying off; but during said time fifteen of them were lost, reasonably worth 815 per head, and after diligent search could not be found. Further evidence was offered as to the expense of pasturing the cattle in another pasture, thereafter procured.
This testimony was all excluded, on the ground that it was immaterial, the measure of damages being the difference, if any, between the contract price and the rental value of the pasture for the unexpired term.
The rule followed by the trial court in excluding this evidence is, undoubtedly the correct rule for measuring the general damages incident to the breach of a covenant for quiet enjoyment in a lease. In addition to the difference between the rent to be paid and the actual value of the unexpired term, the tenant may also recover as special damages such extra expense and damage, if any, as are the natural and proximate result of the breach. 1 Woods’ Landl. and Ten., sec. 362; 1 Taylor’s Landl. and Ten., sec. 317; 3 Suth. on Dam., 149-159.
The rule which confines the general damage to the difference between the rental value and the stipulated rent seems to rest upon the assumption that the tenant can go at once into the market and obtain like property. Addison v. Chandler, 11 Mich., 542. Where the reason of the rule does not exist, it would seem that the rule itself should not apply, to the exclusion of all other considerations in estimating the damages. Special damages, in addition, have been allowed in many instances. Giles v. O’Toole, 4 Barb., 261; Gilley v. Hawkins, 48 Ill., 308; Shaw v. Hoffman, 25 Mich., 162; Rickett v. Lostetter, 19 Ind., 125.
It was held in De la Zerda v. Korn, 25 Texas Supp., 194, that injury to the tenant’s goods or stock in trade, in addition to the value of the use and occupation of the premises, should be considered in estimating the damages.
Whatever special damage naturally and proximately resulted to appellant from the sale of the land and termination of the lease—whatever may reasonably be supposed to have entered into the contemplation of the parties at the time of the contract—he should recover. The items of expense which he sought to prove for pasturage elsewhere, we think, should be included in the general damages, measured by the difference between the market value of the residue of the term and the contract price, and that that part of the evidence was perhaps properly excluded.
As to the extra expense and loss incident to a temporary holding of his cattle on the commons, pending a diligent effort to secure another pasture, if the proof should show that these items were the proximate result of the sale of the land and termination at.that time of the lease, and that thereby a loss was sustained which otherwise would not have occurred, and that it was not the result of the want of proper care and diligence on the part of appellant, we think he would be entitled to recover the amount of loss thus sustained as special damages.
As to what is the proximate cause of an injury, is ordinarily a question for the jury (61 Texas, 353); and we think the court erred in excluding from their consideration all evidence of special damage growing out of the fact that appellant was forced for a time to hold his cattle upon the commons. It may be that upon another trial, with full proof, he would not be entitled to recover anything in the way of special damages; but, talcing all the statements in the bill of exceptions to be true, we are of opinion that the evidence should have gone to the jury.
The law provides no such cast-iron rule for measuring damages as the bill of exceptions indicates was invoked to exclude this evidence. On the other hand, the promise of appellee to pay any or all losses occasioned by the sale ” does not authorize the latitude of recovery for which appellant seems to contend in his brief. Damages allowable on express agreements for indemnity can only be such as naturally and proximately proceed from the cause referred to in the indemnity. 2 Suth. on Dam., 604.
For the error in excluding all testimony except as to the difference between the contract price and the value of the unexpired term, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.

216309,C. U. Connellee et el v. John C. Roberts,1892-11-22,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On June 7, 1871, the will of M. J. Hall, Sr., was admitted to probate in the District Court of Harrison County, Texas. By this will it was provided that no action should be had in the courts in regard to the testator’s estate, except the probate and registration of his will and the return of an inventory, and also that the executors should not be required to give bond. M. J. Hall, Jr., and Samuel S. Mosely were named as executors.
The petition to probate this will was in the name of M. J. Hall, Jr., only, but the order admitting the will to probate directed that letters issue to both executors. There is no evidence that either of the executors ever took an oath as such. M. J. Hall, Jr., however, filed a paper consisting of several pages, which upon its face would appear to have been a very full and complete inventory, were it not for the affidavit attached thereto, which is in the following language:
“ The State of Texas, Harrison County. — Before me, C. E. Bolles, clerk of the District Court of Harrison County, appears M. J. Hall, Jr., who makes oath and says that the within inventory contains all the property and effects of the estate of M. J. Hall, Sr., which up to this time has come into his hands, but this inventory is not complete.
“M. J. Hall, Jk.
“ Sworn to and subscribed before me, this July 13, 1871.
“C. E. Bolles, Clerk.”
This paper was recorded as the inventory of said estate, and upon such record the said M. J. Hall, Jr., proceeded with the administration in all respects as the duly authorized independent executor of said will; and while so acting judgment was rendered against him as such executor in favor of Joseph Mason, on the 12th day of July, 1875, before J. K. Williams, a justice of the peace for Harrison County, and the land in controversy was regularly sold under an execution issued upon this judgment; and appellants claim under this sale. Appellee claims under quitclaim deeds made by the heirs of M. J. Hall, Sr., subsequent to the execution sale aforesaid. The land in controversy appeared regularly upon the inventory filed by the executor as above set forth.
The court below construed the opinion rendered upon a former appeal of this case to hold, that to sustain the execution sale against the executor of M. J. Hall, Sr., it was necessary for the defendants claiming thereunder to prove that the executor qualified by taking the oath required of administrators and executors, and also returned a full and complete inventory of all property belonging to the estate.
By an examination of this opinion, reported m 71 Texas, 14, it will be seen that the principal question presented upon that appeal was as to whether or not the taking of the oath and filing of an inventory by the executor could be proved by parol evidence, or should this be done by certified copies from the records; and it was held, that such copies would be the best evidence, and the court below erred in permitting parol evidence without showing that such copies could not be had. We do not find anything in this opinion which goes to the extent of holding that the taking of an oath by an independent executor would be essential to the validity of a sale made against him while acting as such; nor do we construe the opinion as holding that the return by him of a full inventory, or even any inventory, would be absolutely essential under all circumstances to the validity of such a sale, although there are expressions therein which might be given this construction.
By the law in force at the time this will was admitted to probate it was provided, that “a testator may direct by his will that no action be had in the District Court in the administration of his estate except, first, to prove and record the will; second, to prove and record the will and return an inventory and appraisement of the estate; third, he may direct that the person named as his executor shall not be required to give bond.” Pasch. Dig., art. 5626. Also: “ When a will contains directions that no action be had in the District Court in the administration of the estate, except to prove and record the same, or to prove and record it and return an inventory and appraisement, no other provision of this act, except as disclosed in subdivision 4 of section 158, shall apply to such estate; but the same shall become like any other property to be administered under a power chargeable in the hands of a trustee, and liable to execution in any court having jurisdiction.” Pasch. Dig., art. 5628.
The provisions in this act with reference to giving bonds and taking oaths by executors and administrators is found in Paschal’s Digest, article 5574,. as follows: “Where it is not otherwise provided, a bond shall be required to be given and an oath to be taken at a time specified in the order within twenty days.”
We think that a fair construction of the different portions of this act leads to the conclusion, that it was not essential to the qualification of an independent executor, that any oath as such should be taken by him, and that his qualification would be complete upon the probate of the will and acceptance of the trust by him, with the return of an inventory and appraisement of the estate when this, was required by the law. We are aware that most of the cases in speaking of the acts of an independent executor mention the executor as having qualified as such, but we are not aware of any case which prescribes the requisites of such qualification to include the taking of an oath. In Mayes v. Blanton, 67 Texas, 247, it is said: “It appears that T. Schlutter died testate in the year 1877, and by liis will named three persons executors, two of whom renounced the executor-ship, and the other probated the will, and in accordance with its terms received letters testamentary which empowered him to administer the estate without the control of the Probate Court. The executor seems to have returned an inventory and appraisement.”
It will be noticed that no allusion was made to the executor having taken an oath in this case, although his qualification was treated as complete.
We are therefore of the opinion that the court below erred in treating the taking of an oath by an independent executor as essential to his legal qualification as such. We do not wish, however, to be understood as intimating that even if the law required such executors to qualify by taking an oath, a failure to comply with such provision would be fatal to liis acts when called in question collaterally, as in this case.
We are further of opinion that the court below laid too much stress upon the use of the word “ full” in the opinion rendered upon the former appeal. The question before the court upon that appeal was not so much the necessity of an inventory to the validity of the sale in question, as it was the kind of evidence necessary to prove the return of such inventory. ¡Not intimation was made in that opinion of a desire or intention to overrule, or call in question, the previous cases of Cooper v. Horner, 62 Texas, 356, and Willis v. Ferguson, 46 Texas, 496, to the effect that the return of an inventory would not be essential to the validity of a sale made by an independent executor in all cases.
In this case, as will be seen from the conclusions of fact, the inventory to all appearances would have been full and complete but for the statement in the affidavit that it was not complete. As to the particular land in controversy, however, it was full and complete in every particular, and we are clearly of the opinion that this addition to the affidavit made by the executor should not affect this sale. We apprehend that few inventories are returned in any estate that embrace every item of property owned by the deceased at the time of his death; and we can not see how the addition to an affidavit of a statement of a fact, which must almost of necessity exist in every case, would on a collateral attack invalidate a sale of the property in the administration of such estate. It would hardly be contended that if this addition had not been made to the affidavit, the mere fact that some item of property had been omitted from the inventory would have invalidated this sale, and we can not see how the statement that this fact did exist should have any greater weight than the existence of the fact without stating it in the affidavit. We are therefore of the opinion, that where an inventory has been returned by an executor, which includes all the property in controversy, a sale thereof can not be collaterally attacked, even though the inventory might not be complete as to other property, and that the court erred in holding differently upon the trial below.
Delivered November 22, 1892.
No question was made in the trial below as to the sufficiency of the evidence to show that the executor Mosely had refused to act so as to authorize his coexecutor Hall to proceed alone (Eskridge v. Patterson, 78 Texas, 417; Bennett v. Kiber, 76 Texas, 385); nor was any question made as to the failure of appellee to offer to refund the money for which the land was sold at the execution sale. Smithwick v. Kelly, 79 Texas, 576.
Appellee in his brief contends that appellants are not entitled to have considered their assignments presenting the questions above discussed, because the findings of the court below were not excepted to. We do not find this sustained by the record. In the judgment rendered by the court it was duly noted that defendants excepted thereto. Voight v. Mackle, 71 Texas, 78. Besides, this case is brought before us upon a full statement of facts as well as conclusions of the trial judge, and in such cases the rule laid down by appellee does not apply. Tudor v. Hodges, 71 Texas, 392.
Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and here rendered in favor of appellants for the land in controversy, and it is so ordered.
Reversed and rendered."
219071,M. S. Swearingen v. F. A. Reed and J. A. Reed,1893-02-16,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This is an appeal prosecuted by M. S. Swearingen from a judgment rendered by the District Court of Childress County in behalf of Fannie A. Reed, the wife of James A. Reed. This lady, joined by her husband, brought this suit, in the nature of an action of trespass to try title, to recover from appellant, M. S. Swearingen, in her separate interest, 10 acres of land out of the south half of section 576, block H, in Childress County, Texas. This section was located by virtue of certificate number g-fg, granted to the Waco & Northwestern Railway Company.
In 1886 the State Land Board, under the Act of 1883, and upon the application of J. A. Reed, sold and awarded to him the south half of the section described, which was school land.
January 13, 1888, James A. Reed, for the recited consideration of §450, executed a deed with clause of general warranty to his wife, Fannie A. Reed. This deed contains no recital that the conveyance is intended for the separate use and benefit of the wife. It purports to be executed in Childress County, Texas. The land conveyed is described therein as “the south half of section number 576, block H, Waco & Northwestern Railway Company survey, certificate number gJ-g.” The State or county in which the land is situated is not recited. The deed, properly acknowledged, was recorded in Childress County, January 13, 1888. It is alleged in the petition, that the proper number of the certificate referred to in the deed is g|g, and that the number recited in the deed as gj-g was inserted by mistake. James A. Reed, the grantor, testified that the deed should have recited the certificate number as gf-g, instead of g-J-g; that the former is the true certificate number of section 576.
On this conveyance rests the claim of the appellee Fannie A. Reed. August 6, 1890, James A. Reed filed an instrument designating 200 acres of the south half of section 576 as the homestead of himself and family. On the same day he executed to J. W. Swearingen a deed conveying 10 acres out of the south half of the survey named, the 10 acres, however, not being included in the homestead designation. August 11, 1890, J. W. Swearingen conveyed the 10 acres named to M. S. Swearingen, the appellant herein.
The appellant and the appellee Fannie A. Reed claim under James A. Reed as a common source of title.
The two assignments of error inserted in appellant’s brief contain, in effect, the same complaint, viz., that the court erred in concluding as a matter of law that by the deed from James A. Reed to his wife, Fannie A. Reed, the former was divested of all title to the entire south half (including the 10 acres in controversy) of section 576, block H, Waco & Northwestern Railway Company stirvey, located by virtue of certificate T|g-, in Childress County.
1. As the appellant deraigns his title from James A. Reed as the common source, we find no merit in his several propositions asserting the existence of an outstanding title in the State, because of the fact alleged by Mm (though not found by us to exist), that Reed failed to comply with the statute of 1883 providing for the sale of school land. The appellant will not be permitted to impugn the title of Reed, under which he claims, but is held to admit its validity. Glover v. Thomas, 75 Texas, 506.
2. The deed from James A. Reed to his wife indicates on its face, we think, an intention by him to vest in her as her separate property the land therein described. In a transaction between husband and wife it is not necessary that the deed, in order to have the effect referred to, should contain a recital that the conveyance is intended for the separate use of' the wife. Lewis v. Simon, 72 Texas, 475; Callahan v. Houston, 78 Texas, 494. Only creditors or subsequent purchasers without notice can question the validity of such a deed. De Garca v. Galvan, 55 Texas, 53;. Brown v. Brown, 71 Texas, 355.
James A. Reed testified, “ that he executed the deed in question to his wife for the purpose of inducing her to come to Texas and live with him; that he did not intend by the execution of the deed that the property therein described should become the separate property of his wife; that he had intended that himself and his wife should own it equally, living on it and using it together; that he did not communicate to his ^ife that such were his intentions in making the deed.” The court, in a finding of fact, holds this evidence to be inadmissible and declines to consider it in arriving at his conclusions.
Under a proposition in appellant’s brief, to the effect that the evidence shows that it was not the intention of James A. Reed to vest the title in his wife to the property in question, it is sought, in an argumentative way, to complain of this finding of the court. It was the duty of appellant, if he desired to invoke a review by us of this action of the court, to complain of it by specific assignment of error. As he has failed so to suggest the question, we decline to consider it. We think that had the court weighed the testimony and. notwithstanding, found that it was the intention of James A. Eeed to convey the property to the separate benefit of his wife, there would be sufficient evidence gathered from the terms of the deed itself to sustain this finding. We express no opinion, however, on the admissibility of the statement of the husband.
3. It appears that at the date of the execution of this instrument James A. Eeed had made to the State only one payment of the purchase money of the land, the remaining indebtedness not having matured. On this fact appellant founds the contention, that the contract between Eeed and his wife (having necessary reference to future payments for the land to be made out of the community funds) was void. We are unable to sustain this proposition. As appellant does not pretend to have occupied the attitude of a creditor of James A. Eeed, he can not complain of the transaction by which the husband secured to the separate use of his wife future acquisitions which would, in the absence of such a contract, be community property. Thus, though interest accruing upon the separate money of the wife is of the community, the husband, nevertheless, can so contract with the wife that such interest, except as to the existing creditors, shall be the separate property of the wife. Hall v. Hall, 52 Texas, 294; Martin Brown Co. v. Perrill, 77 Texas, 204.
4. We are of opinion that the court was justified in concluding that the appellant and his vendor should be held to be affected at the time of their purchase with notice of the conveyance by James A. Eeed to his wife. The description of the land, though defective and incorrect as to the certificate number, as already pointed out, was, inasmuch as it indicated the correct section and name of the survey, and inasmuch as the deed was duly recorded, sufficient to put a prudent man upon inquiry with reference to the scope and character of the instrument and of the property thereby conveyed.
The judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed.

216281,B. W. Rhine v. Louis Hodge and L. A. Hodge,1892-11-22,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This suit involves the title to 62.27 acres of land out of the Thomas Chambers survey, in Collin County. It was brought by the appellant against the appellees, in the District Court of Collin County, and resulted, on January 19, 1889, in a verdict by a jury, and in a judgment accordingly, in favor of appellees, from which appellant prosecutes this appeal.
1. Prior to October, 1871, the land in controversy was the separate property of Mrs. Sarah F. B. Ford, wife of L. D. Ford.
2. At that date Mrs. Sarah F. B. Ford, joined by her husband, L. D. Ford, executed what purported to be a deed of conveyance to said land to one J. G. Hatch. This instrument was recorded September 9, 1879.
3. The certificate of the officer taking the acknowledgment to this instrument fails to state that he explained it to Mrs. Ford.
4. This instrument is the common source of the title of plaintiff and defendants, and was so introduced and relied upon at the trial.
5. It recited as a part consideration therefor three promissory notes executed by Hatch, aggregating the sum of $150, and payable to Sarah F. B. Ford or bearer.
6. Neither the instrument itself nor the notes expressly retain the vendor’s lien to secure the payment of the deferred purchase money. The notes, however, recite that they were given in part payment of the land.
7. On each of the notes is an endorsement by Sarah F. B. Ford and L. D. Ford, assigning it to B. W. Rhine, appellant, and guaranteeing its payment.
8. After this endorsement, and in February, 1873, B. W. Rhine brought suit, No. 1351, upon these notes in the District Court of Collin County, against J. Gf. Hatch, the maker of the notes, and against Mrs. S. F. B. Ford and her husband, L. D. Ford. In this suit plaintiff sought judgment for the amount of the notes and a foreclosure of a vendor’s lien upon the land in question.
9. December 1, 1873, B. W. Rhine obtained a judgment as prayed for in cause No. 1351, which was followed by an order of sale dated January 9, 1874, and a sale thereunder on the first Tuesday in February, 1874, and a sheriff’s deed in accordance therewith, promptly recorded.
10. The instrument from S. F. B. Ford and husband to J. Gf. Hatch, Supplemented by the foreclosure proceedings culminating in a sheriff’s deed,-constitutes the appellant’s title to the land in controversy.
11. December 28, 1871, J. G. Hatch, by deed, conveyed the land to one John G. Bailey, who died in March, 1878, or about that time, leaving surviving as his heir his daughter L. A. Bailey, who afterward intermarried with Louis Hodge, and, with him, is the appellee herein.
12. This deed from Hatch to Bailey was not recorded until December 9, 1879.
13. There was evidence, which the jury found to be true, showing that at the time of the institution of the foreclosure suit, No. 1351, John G. Bailey was in possession of the land, claiming it under the deed from Hatch; and when this suit was brought appellees were in possession, claiming under the same deed.
14. As already indicated, John G. Bailey was not a party to the foreclosure suit, No. 1351.
There are several assignments of error. We do not, however, think it necessary to set them out, or to consider them separately. The complaint, in each of them urged, is founded upon the following portion of the court’s charge:
’ “ If you [the jury] believe from the evidence that plaintiff in said foreclosure suit ever had actual notice or was in law chargeable with notice of said deed from Hatch to Bailey, you will find for the defendants; and in deciding as to whether plaintiff had such notice or not, you are instructed that if you believe from the evidence that at the time of the institution of said foreclosure suit, on the 27tli day of February, 1873, the said John Bailey was in actual possession of said land and living thereon, you will find that plaintiff was chargeable with notice of said deed.”
The deed from Mrs. S. F. B. Ford and her husband to Hatch, on account of the omission of the officer to show that he had explained the instrument to the wife, could not, unaided, serve as a source of title, either legal or equitable, in plaintiff or in any one else. Berry v. Donley, 26 Texas, 737; Johnson v. Bryan, 62 Texas, 625; Ruleman v. Pritchett, 56 Texas, 483; Jones v. Robbins, 74 Texas, 615.
The charge in question indicates the conclusion by the trial court that Mrs. Ford, by virtue of the judgment in the foreclosure suit, was estopped from denying the validity of the deed from Hatch. We are not required to consider the soundness of this conclusion; because, as the appellant’s contention is founded upon it, lie is in no condition to complain of it. The charge, however, indicates the additional conclusion by the court that this estoppel would inure as well to the benefit of John G. Bailey, and to his heir Mrs. Hodge, as to the appellant. It is of the latter conclusion that appellant complains. He insists that as to him the deed was in all respects validated by the foreclosure suit; but that as to Bailey and his heirs it was and is a nullity.
If there was an estoppel against Mrs. Ford on account of the judgment of foreclosure, it had reference to the deed in question. The notes involved in that suit were executed in consideration of the deed, and if they were adjudicated to constitute a lien upon the land, it was only because it had also been adjudicated that the land had been conveyed. The judgment, therefore, had necessary reference to the deed, and if by the-judgment title was divested out of Mrs. Ford, such divestiture had relation to the deed and to the date thereof. The benefit of such divestiture extended to the vendee in the deed, J. G. Hatch, and to all his privies in estate, as well to his vendee Bailey, the ancestor of the appellee Mrs. Hodge, as to the plaintiff claiming under the foreclosure proceedings against Hatch.
We, therefore, for the purpose of disposing of this question, treat the deed as having been in all respects validated by the foreclosure proceedings. Now, as neither the deed nor the notes contemporaneously drawn expressly retained the vendor’s lien, the former, as an executed contract, must be admitted to have passed the legal title to Hatch, subject only to the implied vendor’s lien. In such a case, the holder of the purchase money notes must sue not only the maker of the notes, but also the subsequent purchaser, if there be one, of whose claim the plaintiff has notice, actual or constructive. The legal title in the latter by virtue of the deed can not be affected by the foreclosure proceedings unless he be made a party thereto. Ufford v. Wells, 52 Texas, 612; Robinson v. Black, 56 Texas, 215; Ransom v. Brown, 63 Texas, 188; Foster v. Powers, 64 Texas, 247.
Under the facts of this case, as there was evidence showing that at the time of the institution of the foreclosure proceedings appellee’s ancestor was in the actual possession of the land, claiming it under the deed from Hatch to himself, appellant will not be heard to complain of the court’s instruction that such possession would operate as notice of the existence of the deed. Watkins v. Edwards, 23 Texas, 443; Hawley v. Bullock, 29 Texas, 223; Mainwarring v. Templeman, 51 Texas, 212; Wimberly v. Bailey, 58 Texas, 227.
Delivered November 22, 1892.
Hence the legal title, remaining in Bailey unaffected by the plaintiff’s foreclosure proceedings, and passing by inheritance to the appellee Mrs. Hodge, can not be subordinated to appellant’s claim.
If, on the other hand, the court erred in holding that the judgment in the foreclosure suit operated as an estoppel against Mrs. Ford, appellant will be remitted to the void deed as the basis of his title. In that event, being required to recover on the strength of his title, and being without title, he could not maintain his cause.
We therefore hold that the judgment should be affirmed, and it is so ordered..
Affirmed.
Justice Head did not sit in this case."
216200,"The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. J. E. Jones",1892-11-22,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This is an appeal from a judgment rendered in the District Court of Collin County, in favor of appellee as plaintiff and against appellant as defendant, for the sum of $500.
The suit was brought to recover damages amounting to $800, alleged to be due to the action of appellant in pulling down appellee’s pasture fence while building its line of railway, and to appellant’s failure to construct proper cattle guards, and in permitting stock to enter appellee’s pasture and to remain depredating thereon.
On the trial, the plaintiff introduced witnesses who testified as to the injury from incursions or depredations of stock, fixing upon the injury to the grass with reference to its use as a pasture, and also upon the injury to the sod and permanent injury to the pasture. To this testimony the defendant objected, “ because there was no allegation of permanent injury to the pasture or to the sod, but that the only allegation of injury in this connection was as to the grass.” The action of the court in overruling this objection is assigned as error.
Among the allegations in the petition are the following: “ Large numbers of horses, hogs, mules, cattle, and sheep went into said enclosure and trespassed upon the same from the 1st day of July, 1886, until the 31st day of January next following, and ate up and tramped down and destroyed the grass growing upon plaintiff’s said pasture; that plaintiff’s said pasture was grazed down and tramped up to such an extent by the1' stock that the grass thereon was destroyed and killed, and that it did not furnish a sufficient pasturage for plaintiff’s stock during the winter and spring of 1887; that for four months during the year 1886 the defendants unlawfully caused 200 head of its stock to be herded in plaintiff's enclosure.”
The term “pasture” includes not only the grass growing upon the ground, but the ground or sod itself upon which the grass grows; and when, in connection with the remaining averments set out, it is alleged, in effect, that the ground or sod was so ‘ ‘ tramped up ’ ’ that ‘ ‘ the grass growing thereon was killed,” we think, in the absence of special exception, at least, that this averment should be held to charge injury to the sod, or permanent injury. No special exception on account of the absence of such an allegation was addressed to the petition. Attempts to take advantage of a defective pleading by objection to the admissibility of evidence are not regarded with great favor. The pleading, on the other hand, is under such circumstances liberally interpreted. Black v. Drury, 24 Texas, 289; Holstein v. Adams, 72 Texas, 489.
The plaintiff testified, among other matters, as follows: “The value of the use of the grass from September 2 to the last of June was $200 per month. During this time I had about 80 or 100 head of my own stock in the pasture. There were as many or inore stock in there during all of said time than those that belonged tome.” The defendant objected to this testimony, because it was not shown that the “ use by defendant or the occupancy of the pasture by defendant was exclusive, or that plaintiff had no use of same during that time, or that the grass was totally destroyed.”
Appellant assigns as error the overruling of this objection, contending that the testimony as to the value of the use of the pasture during the period named is “ irrelevant and misleading as indicating a measure of damages, since the value as a pasture was shared by plaintiff and the destruction was not total.”
It would, in our opinion, have been difficult for a jury to estimate the damage arising from the partial use of the pasture by defendant’s stock, in the absence of proof as to the value of the use of the entire pasture for the term stated. The value of the use in part which the jury had to determine could best be ascertained by the knowledge of the use of the pasture in its entirety. As the use of the pasture by defendant was not exclusive, it was the duty of the court to guard it against being liable to the extent of the use by plaintiff’s stock. This the court in its charge amply did. The assignment is therefore without merit.
Appellant’s third assignment of error is as follows: “The court erred in its charge to the jury, viz.: ‘ If you find in favor of plaintiff, the measure of his damage will be such sum as will, as a present payment in cash, fairly and reasonably compensate him for the value of any of the growing grass on said pasture that may have been eaten by stock not belonging to him, and which stock entered through the opening or openings you may find were wrongfully left by defendant, as aforesaid; also for any damage to the land as a future pasture that may have been caused by such stock tramping down the sod thereon.’ In this the court erred in fixing upon such sum as will 1 as a present payment in cash,’ and indicated an improper measure of damage because the estimate of damage would be reckoned from the extent of the injury at the time of occasion, with 8 per cent interest; and said charge was further objectionable in that the jury were directed to consider ‘ the value of any of the growing grass, also any damage to the land as a future pasture, ’ whereas there was no allegation of permanent injury to the land, or permanent injury to the pasture. ’ ’
We have alread)r held to be untenable the proposition contained in the foregoing assignment, to the effect that there was no allegation of permanent injury to the pasture, and hence no basis for an instruction in regard to “ damage to land as a future pasture.” We are hence brought to the inquiries: 1st. Did the court err in submitting as a measure of damage “ such sum as will, as a present payment in cash, fairly and reasonably compensate the plaintiff for the value of any of the growing grass on said pasture that may have been eaten by stock not belonging to him ?” 2nd. Does this instruction, if erroneous, require a reversal of the judgment ?
Reading this charge in connection with the evidence, it is apparent that the court meant, and that the jury must have understood, that the value mentioned referred to the value of the grass at the time of its consumption. According to the rule the proper measure of damage was the value of the grass at this date, with 8 per cent interest, to be computed to the time of the trial. Railway v. Joachimi, 58 Texas, 456; Railway v. Young, 60 Texas, 204. The reason for the rule evidently is, that by this test the jury can best estimate what, as a payment in cash at the time of the trial, will serve as a fair and reasonable compensation for the property (in this case the grass) consumed. The court in this instance instructed the jury as to the proper end to be kept in view in its deliberations. It only failed to charge the jury as to the means by which that end could be reached. The error was; therefore, one of omission and not of commission. Appellant has failed to show that any improper evidence was admitted by the court, misleading the jury in seeking the proper assessment of damages. Under such circumstances it would seem to have been the duty of the appellant to ask a special instruction covering the omission. Railway v. Joachimi, 58 Texas, 460; Railway v. Delaliunty, 53 Texas, 213. Besides, appellant offered no evidence on flip trial. It acquiesced in the error of omission referred to, which we can not, from the record, apprehend to have in any way misled the jury to the prejudice of appellant. Such error does not call for a reversal of the judgment. Hollingsworth v. Holshousen, 17 Texas, 47; Cook v. Wootters, 42 Texas, 294; Houston County v. Dwyer, 59 Texas, 114.
Delivered November 22, 1892.
We are unable to sustain appellant’s fourth assignment of error, to the effect that “ the verdict was excessive, because the only competent evidence as to damage to the pasture was too intangible and uncertain to estimate.’ ’ There was evidence from which the jury could deduce the value of the grass destroyed by stock trespassing on the pasture on account of the negligence of appellant, which with other sources of damage not complained of by appellant would amply justify the amount of the verdict.
The judgment is affirmed.

219238,"The Equitable Mortgage Company v. Weddington, Slaton, and Sears",1893-02-23,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
Sometime in May, 1887, appellant and appellees entered into a contract by which appellees were to procure loans for appellant upon country real estate in Clay County, Texas, upon the terms set forth in a rate sheet furnished them. By the terms of this contract, on all loans from $500 to $1500 at 10 per cent interest, appellees were required to obtain their compensation from the borrower; on loans from $1500 and over at 10 per cent interest, appellant was to pay appellees a commission of 2 per cent, and appellees could also obtain such additional compensation from the borrower as they might be able to do; on loans from $1500 to $3000 at 9 per cent interest, appellant was to receive in addition to such interest a premium of 1 per cent; on loans over $3000 at 9 per cent interest, appellees were to obtain their compensation from the borrower. By the terms of this contract appellant was to make loans upon such land in Clay County through no other person, and appellees were to procure loans upon such lands for no other company. The time for the continuance of this arrangement was not specified. The contract was made in Clay County, Texas.
In the summer of 1889 appellant negotiated a loan with Byers Bros, for $60,000, and with H. B. Sanborn for $44,000, both secured by mortgage upon land in Clay County.. These loans were made through an agent other than appellees, and appellees instituted this suit to recover of appellant a commission of 2 per cent thereon as damages for the breach of said contract by it. To this suit appellant pleaded, that it was a foreign corporation, doing business in this State under, a permit from the Secretary of State, and that its principal office was in Dallas County, and that it had no agency or representative in Clay County, and claimed its right to be sued in Dallas County. Upon the trial, on this plea the court below instructed the jury to find against the same, and appellant’s first assignment of error calls in question the correctness of this action of the court.
The twenty-first exception to article 1198 of our Revised Statutes, which prescribes the venue of suits, provides, that ‘ ‘ suits against any private corporation, association, or joint stock company may be commenced in any county in which the cause of action of a part thereof arose, or in which such corporation, association, or company has an agency or representative, or in which its principal office is situated.” To determine where a cause of action arose or accrued within the meaning of statutes of this kind frequently presents questions of considerable difficulty. Appellant contends that this statute has special reference to the place of performance, and that a suit could only be maintained in the county in which the defendant, by the terms of the contract, was to perform its part thereof; but we are of opinion that this construction of the statute is too restricted. By the terms of the contract these loans were to be secured upon lands situated in Clay County. The contract was made in Clay County. Appellees resided in Clay County, and it was contemplated that at least the greater part of their work would be done in that county. They were employed because they lived in that county, and were expected to solicit loans there. Appellant, by the terms of the contract, was to send its agent to Clay County to examine and pass upon the value of the lands upon which the loans were to be secured. Under such a contract, for a breach thereof we believe that the cause of action should be held to have arisen, at least in part, in Clay County within the meaning of our statute. Railway v. Hill, 63 Texas, 381; Phillio v. Blythe, 12 Texas, 124; Durst v. Swift, 11 Texas, 273. The evidence was undisputed as to the terms of the contract and the manner in which it was to be performed, and there was therefore no error in the court instructing the jury to find against appellant’s plea of privilege.
Appellees also contend, that appellant waived its plea of privilege to be sued in Dallas County by answering to the merits of the case, and it must be conceded that there is an unguarded expression contained in the opinion in the case of Railway v. Traweek, 84 Texas, 69, which seems to support this view; but we are of opinion that the case of Railway v. Whitley, 77 Texas, 126, is more in point and should be followed. This case holds, that where these pleas are filed in due order, an answer to the merits does not waive a plea of this kind. As we understand the York case, referred to in the opinion in 84-Texas, it only decides the effect to be given to such pleading as an appearance when filed by a nonresident, and does not apply to the case of a foreign corporation having an agent in this State. In such cases the venue is prescribed by the statute above quoted.
In making the loans to Byers Bros, and Sanborn, appellant acted entirely through other parties, and these loans were made at a rate of interest not authorized by the rate sheet furnished to appellees. By the-terms of the contract, however, appellant had no right during its continuance to make a loan of this kind at any rate of interest except through appellees, and in such cases, where application was made to it, it should have referred the parties to appellees to enable them to negotiate the loan and obtain such compensation from the borrower as they might be able to secure. There is evidence in the record which tends to show, that in addition to the rate of interest appellant was to receive upon these loans, there was also paid a commission to the agent through whom the same were negotiated.
The court, after charging upon other issues in the case, gave the following charge on the measure of damages, which is complained of by appellant, to-wit:
“If you find under the foregoing instructions, that plaintiffs are entitled to recover damage for the making of the Byers Bros, or the San-born loan, or both of them, then you will find for plaintiffs what would have been a reasonable compensation for the making of said loan or loans, had they been permitted to make the same.”
As we understand this charge, and as the jury must have understood it, the court below held the law to be, that if appellant violated its contract in making these loans, appellees would be entitled to recover reasonable compensation (not measured b)r the terms of the contract) for making loans of that kind, even though they performed no service-in making-the same. As so understood, we believe the charge to be erroneous. Where one party to a contract is prevented by the other from earning profits thereunder, and the amount of such profit that would have been earned can be reasonably ascertained from the evidence, this will furnish the measure of damages. Railway v. Hill, 63 Texas, 381; Tel. Co. v. Bowen, 84 Texas, 476; Tel. Co. v. Brown, 84 Texas, 54.
In this case, if the jury, under the evidence, should-find, that had these loans been referred to appellees, they would have realized the commissions that were paid to the agent who did negotiate them, or if the evidence should reasonably show that they would have been able to have obtained a greater commission than was paid, they should be allowed to-recover the amount that was so lost. In other words, we believe that the compensation that appellees would have been enabled to secure from the borrowers, had they been permitted to negotiate these loans, must furnish the measure of their damages for being deprived of the opportunity to earn the same, if this can be reasonably ascertained from the evidence.
In 2 Sedgwick on Damages, section 670, it is said: “ The compensation of a servant or agent often depends upon a contingency. In such a case, where a breach of the contract by the employer prevents the happening of the contingency, he will not be allowed, by taking advantage of his own breach of contract, to prevent the plaintiff from recovering compensation altogether. If in such a case the amount of compensation can be determined, the plaintiff will be allowed to recover it, though, through the defendant’s default, the contingency upon which it was payable has not happened. Thus, whore plaintiff was to receive £20 at Lady-day, if he stayed till then, and the defendant wrongfully discharged him before Lady-day, he was allowed to recover the £20. Where a broker secures a proper purchaser for his principal, he is entitled to his commission, though the principal refuses to sell, or through defect of title can not convey. And where the broker was to have all he could get for the land over 8200, it was held, that he could recover what a proper purchaser, secured by him, was willing to pay over 8200, though the owner refused to sell. In Fairchild v. Rogers it was held, that the agreed commission could be recovered upon breach by the owner, on proof that the price named would certainly have been obtained, though the broker did not actually secure a customer.
£t Where the amount of compensation which would be due under the contract can not be determined, the plaintiff may recover the value of his services. Thus, where the plaintiff was engaged by the defendant to train, enter in races, and ride the defendant’s horse in races for a year, his compensation to be two-tliirds of the net profits, and the defendant broke the contract, the defendant claimed that the measure of damages was two-tliirds of the value of the use of the horse for a year. The court, however, allowed the plaintiff to recover the value of his services, on the ground that the defendant had put it entirely out of the plaintiff’s power to secure remuneration at the contract rate.”
Had appellees actually rendered service in procuring these loans, and appellant had wrongfully placed it out of their power to secure their compensation under the contract, they would be allowed to recover the value of their services to the time of the breach; but not having placed their right of action upon this ground, they must be restricted to the compensation they would have earned had the contract not been broken by appellant, and to entitle them to this compensation they must be able to show the amount with reasonable certainty. Wholly conjectural commissions can not be recovered. 2 Sedg. on Dam., 671.
For the error in the charge of the court on the measure of damages, we are of opinion that the judgment rendered in the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial in accordance with this opinion.
Reversed and remanded.

216248,H. C. Ford v. W. C. Ballard et al.,1892-11-22,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This is an action of trespass to try title, and for partition, instituted in the District Court of Haskell County by W. C. Ballard, A. C. Foster, Alice Tankersley and her husband Dock Tankersley, against H. C. Ford, T. W. Mays, J. E. Norton, and W. H. Campbell. . .
There was a trial without a jury, which resulted in a judgment in favor of Ballard and Foster for an undivided interest of 483f acres of the land sued for, and in favor of Alice Tankersley and Dock Tankersley for an undivided interest of 400 acres, and in favor .of the defendants severally for the other portions of the land, except Campbell and Ford, who were adjudged to take nothing and to pay the costs of the suit. This judgment was agreed to by all the defendants except Ford, who prosecutes this writ of error.
The court below filed no conclusions of law and fact, but there is a statement of facts in the record which shows that there is no controversy about the facts upon which the questions of law arise.
The first assignment of error complains of the action of the court in overruling the application of plaintiff in error for a continuance. The application was made and sworn to by the attorney, and sought to continue the cause to procure the testimony of his client, plaintiff in error. Our conclusion is, that the application failed to show proper diligence, and that the testimony sought to be-obtained was not material, and that therefore the same was properly overruled.
The second assignment complains of the admission in evidence of the deed from Mrs. N. L. Abbey to plaintiffs Ballard and Foster, which conveyed to them the entire tract of land in controversy, to-wit, the John Connor survey of 1744 acres, dated April 30, 1889; the- ground of objection being that this deed bore date subsequent to the date of the ouster, as alleged in the petition, and because it purported to be in lieu of a former deed, without the production of the deed in confirmation of which it purported to be made. The question here raised is decided adversely to plaintiff in error in Jenkins v. Adams, 71 Texas, 1.
The third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh assignments complain of the exclusion from the evidence, (1) of a deed from Mrs. Alice Tankersley to W. E. Rogers, dated May 24, 1873; (2) of a deed from W. E. Rogers to plaintiff in error, dated February 25, 1875, conveying 400 acres undivided interest in the land in controversy. These deeds were excluded on the ground that the husband of Alice Tankersley did not join her in the deed, it being alleged and proved by plaintiff in error that the land was her separate property at the date of said deed. • The record shows that both Rogers and Ford knew that said Alice Tankersley was a married woman; that Rogers made the trade with her husband with the knowledge and consent of his wife, and paid the principal part, if not all, the purchase money to the husband, except that portion .which, in the subsequent sale from Rogers to Ford, the latter agreed to pay and did pay to Dock Tankersley, the husband of Alice; and that this sale was acquiesced in by said Tanlcersleys for about fourteen years. The record contains no evidence of any concealment, misrepresentation, or other improper conduct on the part either of the husband or the wife, except as the bringing of this suit might be so construed. It must, therefore, be held that these deeds were properly excluded, the wife’s deed to her separate property without the joinder of her husband being a nullity. Cannon v. Boutwell, 53 Texas, 626; Peak v. Brinson, 71 Texas, 310; Etheridge v. Price, 73 Texas, 597; Johnson v. Bryan, 62 Texas, 623; Williams v. Ellingsworth, 75 Texas, 483.
Delivered November 22, 1892.
The remaining assignments complain of the judgment rendered. In so far as complaint is made of the decree of partition, the objections can not avail plaintiff in error; because, having been denied a recovery of any interest in the land (if the judgment' to that extent be valid), he would no longer have any interest in the partition proceedings.
It is insisted that inasmuch as Mrs. N. L. Abbey conveyed, in the year 1871, to J. D. Abbey 1280 and to Jack Davis 320 acres of the land in controversy', an outstanding title would defeat any recovery by appellees. As these two undivided interests amounted tti 1600 acres, the entire tract containing 1744 acres, it follows that the subsequent deed from Mrs. Abbey to Foster and Ballard conveyed at least an undivided interest of 144 acres. This would be sufficient to enable them to recover the entire tract as against plaintiff in error. A deed made by said J. D. Abbey in the year 1873, to Alice Tankersley, conveying an undivided interest of 400 acres, was sufficient tó enable Tankersley and wife to maintain this suit in connection with their cotenants, Foster and Ballard, against plaintiff in error, who was in the attitude of a trespasser.
It follows that the judgment must be affirmed.

219180,Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. W. M. Easton,1893-02-23,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
Appellant prosecutes this appeal from a judgment rendered by the District Court of Grayson County in favor of appellee. The suit is for damages on account of personal injuries sustained by the appellee.
On February 12, 1889, appellee was in the employ, as an engineer, of H. C. Cross and Geo. A. Eddy, receivers of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company. He was operating a freight train of nineteen cars on the line or track of railway between Whitesboro, in Grayson County, and Fort Worth, in Tarrant County. This line of railway was the property of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company. By an arrangement .between this company and the receivers of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company, the precise character of which is not disclosed by the record, this line of railway, while exclusively owned by the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, was jointly used by the latter company and the receivers of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company. The trains of the receivers, while on the joint track, were, by virtue of the arrangement referred to, operated under the orders of W. S. Polhemus, dispatcher and superintendent of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company. The appellee, on the day named, in charge of the train of the receivers of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company, as already stated, had received orders from Mr. Polhemus to meet the Texas & Pacific train at Mingo, a station in Den-ton County, between the towns of Pilot Point and Denton. The engineer operating the latter train had likewise received orders to meet the Missouri, Kansas & Texas train operated by appellee at Mingo. The engineer in charge of the Texas & Pacific train violated the orders received by him, and hence, at a point about four miles north of Mingo, without fault on the part of the appellee, and in spite of a diligent effort by him to avoid the catastrophe, and on account of the negligence of the engineer of the Texas & Pacific train, the trains collided, seriously injuring the appellee.
We are unable to approve the proposition of appellant, that under the facts above recited, which were covered by the allegations in plaintiff’s petition, the appellee and the employe on appellant’s train to whose negligence the injuries in question are to be ascribed, were fellow servants. The relation of fellow servant imports that the persons affected shall be 11 engaged in the employment of the same master, in the performance of a common work, and in the discharge of duties having in view the same general purpose.” We do not think, under the facts stated, that the engineer of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company was a fellow servant with the employe of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, so as to prevent a recovery bjr him for injuries due to their negligence, though a joint track was used by the two companies. The fact that the plaintiff was subject to the orders 'of his masters, the receivers, and by virtue-thereof to the control of the superintendent or dispatcher of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, indicates that such superintendent was, pro hac vice, the representative of the receivers, rather than that the plaintiff was the servant of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company.
The appellant, in support of the proposition referred to, cites the cases of Railway v. Dorsey, 66 Texas, 148, and Railway v. Jones, 75 Texas, 151. We think both these cases clearly distinguishable from the present case. There the plaintiff was engaged in the general service of both the railway companies involved. Here the plaintiff was the servant only of the receivers of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company. While the track on which appellee was operating the train of the receivers was jointly used by them and the appellant, the plaintiff was in no sense the servant of appellant. No contract, express or implied, was shown to exist by which, as a servant, he owed it any duty whatever. He was held to obey the orders of the train dispatcher of the appellant, not because the train dispatcher was the employe of the appellant, but because by arrangement between the appellant and the receivers Mr. Polhemus became their train dispatcher also. The plaintiff, in receiving orders-from the train dispatcher mentioned, is presumed to have been acting in obedience to the commands of the receivers, between whom and himself alone a contractual relation is shown to have existed.
The plaintiff’s petition charges the negligence to which his injuries are ascribed as the negligence of “the defendant, the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, its agents and employes,” without specifying the particular agent or employe guilty of the negligence causing the misfortune, and without stating the specific act of negligence complained of. The appellant complains of the action of the court in overruling the special exception addressed, on account of the omission stated, to the plaintiff’s petition. The facts alleged in the petition justif,y the inference that the-accident described was due to the negligence of the defendant. The evidence developed on the trial showed that this negligence was to be ascribed to the engineer in charge of the defendant’s train. This fact, however, the defendant, in framing his petition, could not be supposed to know. It was, on the contrary, a fact peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant. This peculiar knowledge, together with the absence of information on the part of plaintiff as to the special source of the injuries complained of, is, we think, naturally to be inferred from the averments of the petition. Under such circumstances, the pleader is not held to the specific averments, the absence of which appellant complains of. Railway v. Smith, 74 Texas, 276. The circumstances attendant upon the accident were sufficiently described in the petition to apprise the appellant of the negligence with which it was charged, and of the source thereof, to enable appellant to prepare its defense.
Appellant complains of the following paragraph of the court’s charge: “And if you further believe that such collision was occasioned by the negligence of any of the agents, servants, or employes of the defendant, the Texas & Pacific Eailway Company—that is, if you believe that by the use of ordinary care and caution by any agent, servant, or employe of the defendant, the Texas & Pacific Eailway Company, then in charge of the train of the defendant, the Texas & Pacific Eailway Company, such collision could have been avoided—you will return a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.” Appellant objects to this charge, on the ground that it “ embraces negligence on the part of any or all of the servants” of the company operating the train occasioning the collision, whereas it should have been confined to the negligence of the engineer who, under the undisputed testimony, was responsible for the accident. The instruction was framed in conformity with the allegations of the petition. If it was not limited to the particular employe shown by the evidence to have been guilty of negligence, and if for that reason it be erroneous, we do not think that, as there is no conflict in the evidence, with reference to the negligence of the engineer, it could possibly have been detrimental to appellant.
Having thus disposed of all the questions raised in appellant’s brief, we conclude that the judgment should be affirmed. It is so ordered.

216232,J. J. Robertson et al. v. James Mooney,1892-11-22,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This appeal is from a judgment rendered by the District Court of Stephens County, in favor of appellee, who sought to recover of appellants about 10 acres of land near Crystal Falls, in said Stephens County. The case was tried without a jury, and is brought here upon a statement of facts without any conclusions of law and fact.
Appellee claimed under a patent issued under the pre-emption law of 1873; and appellants claimed under a patent issued prior thereto by virtue of a certificate issued to the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railway Company.
The determination of the matter in controversy depends upon the true location of the eastern and southern boundaries of the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railway Company survey. When this survey was made there was a vacant body of land, consisting of about 500 acres, surrounded by the E. L. Walker, Sarah Blythe, J. J. Metcalfe, the Peters Colony surveys 1161, 1170, 1158, 1154, and the Clear Fork of the Brazos River. The location of appellants for about 450 acres was made upon this vacant body of land. They insist that the intention of the State was to grant, by virtue of the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railway Company’s location, all the land included between these older surveys and the river.
If it had been proven on the trial that no actual survey had been made for them, it would seem that their contention should be sustained. In the absence of such proof, however, it must be held that an actual survey was made. Gerald v. Freeman, 68 Texas, 201. Their survey calls to begin at the southwest corner of the E. L. Walker survey, which is a well established corner, and then calls for the southeast and southwest corners of the Peters Colony survey 1161, which are also well established, and thence south to a marked corner on the north line of the Metcalfe; thence east 82 varas to the northeast corner of the Metcalfe, which is an open corner; thence south 712 varas; thence east 1438 varas, calling for the northeast corner of survey 1158; thence north 1344 varas to the bank of the river; thence up the river north 50§ west 482 varas, to a marked corner; thence west 475 varas to the beginning.
It is contended that the call for the northeast corner of 1158 should control, (1) the call for “south 712 varas” from the northeast corner of the Metcalfe, extending it to 986-¡- varas; (2) the call of 1438 varas east, extending it to 1555 varas; (3) the call for north 50f- west 480 varas, changing its distance to 577 varas. It would seem also that this contention should be sustained, if said northeast corner of 1158, or the lines leading to it, could be found marked upon the ground. It is laid down in this State that the rule, that a call for a marked line or corner of an older survey will prevail over a call for course and distance, is not applicable to an unmarked line or corner which can only be found by running course and distance from some other marked line or corner or well known object. The reason of the rule is, that in each instance the boundary is ascertained by calls for course and distance, and hence effect should be given, where such calls are conflicting, to the one which is most in harmony with the other calls of the grant. Gerald v. Freeman, 68 Texas, 201; Duff v. Moore, 68 Texas, 270; Davidson v. Killen, 68 Texas, 406.
The lines and corners of 1158 are all open lines and corners, except the southeast corner, which is well established. The lines and corners of 1154 are likewise open, except its southwest corner, which is the southeast corner of 1158. If the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railway Company’s survey has its southern and eastern boundaries established by the several calls for course and distance, and the call for ■the northeast corner of 1158 be rejected as a mistake, there is complete harmony in all the calls, and the requisite quantity of land is secured. ■Constructing the survey by this method, the calls for 1344 varas north to the corner in the bank of the river, and thence north 5Of west 482 varas to a well established corner, are found to be strictly accurate. Assuming that the surveyor went on the- ground and made an actual survey, it is not an unreasonable conclusion, under the facts disclosed in the record, to hold that when he reached the southeast corner of the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railway Company’s survey, and called for the northeast corner of 1158, he was mistaken as to the locality of that corner, which could not be found upon the ground; also, that in his field notes calling for a corner 1344 varas north to the bank of the river, by the expression “ bearings cut down” (which, however, is not carried into the patent), if he meant to call for the northwest corner of 1154, finding no evidence on the ground of this corner, he erroneously supposed it to be where course and distance, as called for in his field notes, had placed him.
Delivered November 22, 1892.
It seems to us that, under the facts disclosed in the record, according to the rules of construction adopted in this State, the court was not clearly wrong in the conclusion, which evidently must have been reached, that the call for the northeast corner of 1158 should be rejected as a mistake; though there is much force in the contention that it never was intended to leave so small a vacancy between the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado and the older surveys.
The sixth assignment asserts the invalidity of the patent under which appellee claimed, because it appeared from the face of the patent that it was issued by virtue of appellee’s affidavit made before a notary public instead of a clerk either of the District Court or County Court, as required by the Act of 1873 and the amended Act of 1881. Appellants cite us to no authority except the statute in support of this assignment, and it seems to us that it is not well taken.
Our conclusion is that the judgment should be affirmed.
Affirmed."
219235,J. K. Miller et al. v. Curtis Carlton et al.,1893-02-23,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This is an appeal from a judgment rendered by the District Court of Grayson County, whereby the appellees, Curtis Carlton, Rosa Carlton, and Ernest Carlton, recovered certain realty, situated in the ■ city of Denison, from the appellants, J. K. Miller and James N. Miller, father and son. The verdict of the jury indicates that they so interpreted the evidence (conflicting in some of its aspects) as to justify, if not to require from us, the following conclusions of fact:
On January 17, 1877, J. K. Miller sold and conveyed the lot or block of land in controversjr to Lazarus W. Carlton and his wife, Mollie Carlton, the parents of the appellees herein, who were minors when this suit was instituted. The vendees, L. W. Carlton and his wife, paid a portion of the consideration of this property at the time of the purchase, the remainder being represented by a purchase money note for the sum of 8292, besides interest, maturing January 1, 1878, and retaining the vendor’s lien. They also, to secure the deferred payment, executed a deed in trust upon the property to one W. B. Munson, as trustee. They took possession of the property and occupied it as a homestead until L. W. Carlton died in 1879, and after that date the widow, Mollie Carlton, with her children, the appellees herein, continued to occupy it as her homestead until in December, 1882, when she intermarried with one William Shockley.
January 3, 1881, the appellant J. K. Miller brought suit in the District Court of Grayson County against Mollie Carlton, surviving wife of L. W. Carlton, and against Curtis, Rosa, and Ernest Carlton, his children, to recover the amount due upon the purchase money note and to foreclose upon the property in question the vendor’s lien retained in the note.
After the institution of the suit, J. K. Miller agreed with Mrs. Carlton, that if she would deliver to him possession of the premises referred to, he would rent the same out and would apply the proceeds of the lease to the payment of the note, and that he would not prosecute to judgment the suit already brought by him, though it was to remain on the docket; and that when the rent would have paid off the note he would redeliver the premises, to Mrs. Carlton. With this understanding she surrendered to him possession of the property. This agreement with reference to the application of the rent he seems to have carried out until March, 1883. In the meanwhile the suit was dismissed February 12, 1882, for want of prosecution. On December 12, 1882, it was reinstated.
On March 5, 1883, J. K. Miller filed an amended petition, making William Shockley a party defendant. Miller, on May 19, 1883, in violation of his agreement, took judgment by default for the unpaid balance of the note, with an order declaring a foreclosure of the lien upon the property and decreeing the sale thereof. In accordance with this decree, an order of sale was, on January 29, 1883, issued, and the property was sold on the first Tuesday in August, 1883, and the deed executed by the sheriff to the purchaser, J. K. Miller, which was by him filed for record on August 7, 1883.
J. K. Miller and his wife conveyed the property to James N. Miller by deed dated January 22, 1884, and recorded on May 12, 1884. This conveyance was without consideration, the grantor testifying that it was intended as a deed of gift.
The rental value of the property while it was in the possession of the defendants exceeded the amount of the purchase money note. Mrs. Shockley, formerly Mrs. Carlton, died in February, 1884. This suit was .instituted August 6, 1889.
We regard this proceeding as an invocation of the equitable powers of the court, whereby it is sought to have the property, the apparent title to which is in the defendants, charged in their hands with a trust for the plaintiffs equitably entitled to it. The plaintiffs’ petition, while it does not in terms charge fraud on the part of the defendant J. K. Miller, in obtaining the judgment and the sale already referred to, yet avers facts from which the conclusion of fraud inevitably follows. The court below therefore correctly, as we think, overruled the contention of appellants, urged there and persistently reasserted here, that this proceeding is a collateral attack upon the judgment of a court of general jurisdiction, to be deemed conclusive against the claim by plaintiffs to the property involved.
The judgment of the District Court of Grayson County which declared the lien and ordered the sale of the “property remains undisturbed. On account, however, of the fact, that in securing the sale of the property and the consequent investiture of title in himself, the defendant J. K. Miller availed himself of an agreement (whether intentionally fraudulent it is not necessary to consider), by which he lulled into passiveness appellees and their mother, he should be decreed to hold the title thus obtained subject to and in trust for their recognized rights. By means of this judgment, obtained under such circumstances, and of the sale resulting therefrom, equity can not be thwarted in the discharge of a task peculiar to it, of averting the consequences of fraud, actual or constructive.
The doctrine here applied is not believed by us to conflict with that which holds the judgment of a court of general jurisdiction unassailable collaterally. The judgments of Probate Courts, which in matters pertaining to their jurisdiction are courts of equal dignity with our District Courts acting with reference to subjects within their cognizance, have been several times thus interpreted. Martin v. Robinson, 67 Texas, 369; Fisher v. Wood, 65 Texas, 204; Storer v. Lane, 1 Texas Civ. App., 250. While the decrees themselves have been declared unimpaired, the titles thereunder acquired, resting upon fraudulent devices antedating the decrees, have been charged with a trust for the benefit of the victims of these devices. As James N. Miller, the remaining defendant, obtained the property without consideration from his father, he occupies, with reference to the assertion of his rights, the same attitude as the latter.
The appellants complain of the refusal of the trial court to give a special instruction requested by them upon the plea of limitations. This instruction embraced two clauses. The first clause was erroneous, because it did not limit the period of adverse possession to five years before the institution of the suit, but extended it to the time of the trial. Besides, as requested, it could not have benefited appellants, as it was not to apply if the appellees were minors, and their minority was undisputed. The second clause was erroneous, because it was made to rest upon the alleged fact, that at sometime during the period of the defendants’ possession the mother of the plaintiff was a widow, whereas the evidence showed that during that period she was constantly under coverture. The testimony, except perhaps as to Mrs. Carlton’s half-interest, presented no aspect under which the statute could be invoked by the defendants; and to that phase the requested instruction was not sufficient even to invite the attention of the court. The charge was properly refused.
We do not concur with appellants, that the verdict of the jury finding the agreement on the part of J. K. Miller, already recited in our conclusions of fact, is contrary to the evidence. The evidence was so conflicting on this question as to be sufficient to support a finding of the jury, whether for or against the defendants.
Having thus, as we think, sufficiently disposed of all the questions raised in appellants’ brief, we conclude that the judgment should be affirmed. It is so ordered.

216223,Texas Land and Mortgage Company et al. v. Kansas Bridgeman et al.,1892-11-22,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
The land in controversy was patented to Geo. F. Bridgeman, April 8, 1876. The patentee was a member of W. J. Bullock’s company, Second Georgia Battalion, and fell with Fannin at Goliad. Appellees claimed as the heirs of the patentee. Appellants claim under a deed purporting to have been made by Jane Bridge-man, Sarah Bridgemam, and Alfred A. Bridgeman, in the city of Philadelphia, on the 30th day of May, 1853, in which deed the grantors claim to be the heirs of the patentee. The court below, as we think upon sufficient evidence, found that appellees were the true heirs, and rendered judgment in their favor. Appellants also claimed by limitation, and the evidence to sustain this defense is as follows:
“It is agreed that upon the question of limitation the defendants proved, that they had a deed to the land in controversy duly registered ■ for more than five years before the institution of this suit; that they redeemed the land from all taxes prior to the year 1883. In 1883 the lands were rendered as their property and marked paid on the rolls, and they paid all taxes from 1884 to 1888, and about June, 1883, they constructed a post and wire fence around a pasture of about 40,000 acres of land, including the land in controversy, and occupied the said pasture for grazing cattle from that time until the institution of this suit, and claimed to own a part and have control of all the lands in controversy; and on this branch of the case defendants proved that there was a public road leading from Henrietta, the county seat, to Charley, in Clay County, which passes through said pasture for a distance of about 12 miles, which was at all times a public traveled county road; that said road was gated at its exit and entrance when said pasture was built, the latter of which was taken down about three years since and the former about two years, since which time said road has not been in any way obstructed; that there is no fence or other improvement than said tank on the land in controversy, and said road ran across one corner of it; that there was about thirteen sections of land in said pasture owned and controlled by parties other than defendants, several of which were never controlled by defendants; that other parties, not tenants of defendants, ranched in said pasture during said time, and one Jordan had at all times about 400 head of cattle grazing therein; that defendants were in litigation with said Jordan about three years, trying to eject his cattle from said pasture, and failed to do so; that Jordan had most of the time about 1000 acres in said pasture, over which defendants had no control; that during the year 1887 one Tobin, Pratt, and Lippincott each had lands leased from others, which they had for grazing purposes, and was a part of the above thirteen sections.”
The court below rendered judgment in favor of appellees for the land in controversy, from which this appeal is taken.
Appellant calls in question the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding of the court below that appellees were the heirs of the patentee of this land. The evidence upon this point was:
First. The deposition of Caroline E. Smith, who testified, that her residence is in Heard County, Georgia; that she is 58 years of age; that her first husband was Robinson Brigman; that she first became acquainted with the Brigman family in the year 1852; that she had heard her first husband and his mother, Temperance Brigman, say that said Robinson Brigman had a brother whose name was George F. Brigman; that said George F. Brigman was killed in Texas in the year 1836 in the' war between Texas and Mexico; that she had always heard the mother of her said husband, Robinson Brigman, say that George F. Brigman was killed in the war between' Texas and Mexico, in the year 1836; that such was the family tradition; * * *' that she never knew George F. Brigman personally; never saw his name written; never saw or had any family record; never heard George F. Brigman’s name spelled or saw it written, and could not write his name; that she can not write; that she can not give an exact copy of the initials or of the spelling of his name; that George F. Brigman was never married.
Second. The deposition of Kansas Jones (formerly Brigman), J. H. Brigman, and Mary Knoff, all of whom testified, that their father, Robinson Brigman, had a brother George F. Brigman, who died unmarried, and that they knew this from family reputation, and that they all reside in Heard County, Georgia.
Third. One W. T. Wood also testified for plaintiff, by deposition, that he was 62 years of age; that he resides at Franklin, in Heard County, Georgia, and is well acquainted with the plaintiffs and has known them for twenty-five or thirty years, and has had business transactions with them; that he is judge of the Court of Ordinary; that plaintiffs are ignorant and illiterate; that they can neither read nor write; that their name is called Bridgman and Brigman; that they are known by both names; that the said Bridgman and Brigman family have a family tradition that George F. Brigman, the brother of plaintiffs’ father, was killed in the war between Texas and Mexico, in the year 1836, and that plaintiffs as his heirs claim to own land in Texas; that he has heard this for many years.
Fourth. A part of the muster roll of Captain W. J. Bullock’s company, Second Georgia Battalion, First Regiment, was read in evidence, showing the name of G. F. Bridgeman as one of the privates therein, and a certificate from the Commissioner of the General Land Office, showing that no other name similar to Bridgman or Brigman appeared upon any of the muster rolls of those engaged in the war between Texas and Mexico.
The defendants read in evidence the deed under which they claim, set forth in the conclusions of fact, and an affidavit purporting to have been made by Samuel Nelson and A. F. Smith, at the time of the execution of said deed, showing that the parties making that deed were the heirs of George F. Bridgeman, who fell with Fannin at Goliad; but no attempt was made to trace any of the parties to this deed or affidavit, and the earliest evidence we have as to the existence of such deed, other than its date, is the fact that it was recorded in Bosque County in October, 1872, and was delivered to Dunlap by his vendor, Brock, in January, 1873.
No objection was made on the trial below to any of the evidence set forth above. The evidence was full that the appellees were the heirs of the George F. Brigman referred to in the depositions introduced by them.
If the heirship of plaintiffs depended entirely upon the similarity of the name Brigman with that of Bridgeman, to whom the land was patented, we do not think the judgment of the court below could be sustained; but when we add to this the facts, that the plaintiffs in this case are ignorant, illiterate people; that their name is sometimes called Brig-man and sometimes Bridgman; that they live in the State from which the patentee seems to have come; that they had an uncle whose given name was George F., the same as that of the patentee; that there has always existed in their family a tradition that this uncle was killed in 1836 in Texas, in the war between Texas and Mexico; that they have for years claimed to own land in Texas as his heirs; that no other person of a name at all similar was engaged in this war; we are not prepared to say that the finding of the court was not correct. Baker v. McFarland, 77 Texas, 294; Leland v. Eckert, 81 Texas, 226.
The Texas Land and Mortgage Company, Limited, was made a defendant in the court below, and filed its answer, pleading not guilty, and vouching in its remote warrantor, W. J. Kellar, who appeared and undertook the defense of the case.
Kellar pleaded not guilty and the statutes of limitation of three, five, and ten years, his plea of the five years statute being as follows: “And for further plea in this behalf the said defendant says that said plaintiffs ought not to have or maintain their aforesaid action thereof against him, because, he says, he has had and held peaceable, continuous, uninterrupted, and exclusive adverse possession under title (or color of title) from and under the State of Texas of the lands and tenements claimed in said plaintiffs’ petition, for more than five years next before the commencement of this suit, and this he is ready to verify,’ ’ etc.
The deed made by this defendant, under which the original defendants claim, was dated January 30, 1883, and from the foregoing conclusions of fact it will be seen that the first possession claimed by defendant was that of Butler Brothers, who commenced to fence the pasture in June, 1883, evidently claiming under this deed.- We are therefore of the opinion that the allegation in this plea that Kellar had had possession for five years, or in fact had ever had possession of this land, is not sustained by the evidence, and for this reason the court below did not err in finding in favor of plaintiffs on the question of limitation.
In Cunningham v. Frantdzen, 26 Texas, 39, it is said: “ The manner of pleading the statute of limitations shows that the defendants relied on their own possession as connected with that of Hays, and not upon that of Hays for three years, disconnected from their own. The charges of the court are shaped with reference to that construction of the plea, and so the verdict of the jury embraces it in its general finding for the defendants. Therefore, although the evidence may show that Hays had possession for three years, under color of title at sometime, though not immediately before suit brought, and although that should be held to extinguish Cunningham’s title and confer title on Hays, still that issue not being made by the pleadings and found by the verdict, the judgment can not be sustained for defendants on that ground. A defense of the statute of limitations is required to be specially pleaded; and therefore, if defendants had relied upon title in Hays by his three years possession, under color of title, disconnected from their own possession, they should have pleaded it in that form, so as to have given notice of it.”
Delivered November 22, 1892.
It is not to be questioned that it was the duty of Kellar as warrantor to present the defense of the statute of limitations so as to protect his vendees (Brown v. Hear on, 66 Texas, 63); but we are of opinion that when he relies upon their possession, and not upon his own, he should, plead the statute in that form, so as to apprise his opponents of what they are called upon to meet; and that an allegation that he, Kellar, had been in possession five years is not sustained by proof that his vendees had such possession. It will also be noticed that this plea of the five years statute nowhere contains an allegation that defendants claimed under a deed duly registered, or that they had paid taxes for the requisite time, and it may also be doubted whether on account of that omission the plea would be sufficient to sustain a judgment based upon this statute, although no exception was made to it (Blackwell v. Patton, 23 Texas, 670; Portis v. Hill, 3 Texas, 280), but we do not express any opinion as to this.
For the reasons above indicated, it will not be necessary for us to consider the sufficiency of. the evidence as set forth in the conclusions of fact, to establish the adverse possession and payment of taxes necessary to sustain the defense under the five years statute. Facts somewhat similar are considered in the cases of Taliaferro v. Butler, 77 Texas, 578, and Church v. Waggoner, 78 Texas, 200.
It will be noted that this judgment was rendered previous to our recent legislation on the subject of limitation as applicable to land embraced in large pastures.
It is not pretended that the evidence shows any defense in favor of appellants under the three and ten years statutes.
Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be in all things affirmed, and it is so ordered.

219173,"The Magnolia Cattle and Land Company v. T. D. Love, Tax Collector",1893-02-23,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
By this suit appellant, as the nonresident owner of a large body of land in Borden County, sought to enjoin the collection of the tax levied and assessed against said land for the year 1891, by the proper officers of Borden County. A preliminary injunction was granted, and afterward upon final hearing was dissolved; hence this appeal.
The case was tried before the court without a jury, on an agreed state.ment of facts, about which there is no controversy, and upon which the district judge filed separate conclusions of law and fact. From these conclusions and the agreed statement, it appears, that Borden County was duly organized on the 17th day of March, 1891, and that her duly elected officers qualified on April 1, 1891, at which last named date the tax assessor of Howard County, to which Borden had been up to that time attached for judicial purposes, had not begun to assess the taxable property of the latter county. That the assessor of Borden County, after the Commissioners Court had levied a tax, and prior to June 1, proceeded to assess all taxable property in said county for the year 1891, and to this end gave timely notice to the duly authorized agent of appellant, a nonresident of said county, to render these lands for taxation, which he refused to do. Thereupon the assessor placed these lands updn the unrendered tax roll, valuing them at $2 per acre, which valuation was approved by the board of equalization. It appears that the acts of the different officers of Borden County in levying, assessing, and proceeding to collect these taxes were in all respects regular.
In January, 1891, the aforesaid agent of appellant handed to the Comptroller a list of said lands, without valuation and not under oath, with the statement that said list contained all of appellant’s lands situated in Borden, Dawson, and Garza counties. The State Board of Equalization valued all lands in unorganized counties at 81.50 per acre.
On the 30th day of December thereafter, said agent offered, for the first time, to pay to the Comptroller the taxes claimed to be due on these lands, as per the rendition made to him as aforesaid; but the Comptroller declined to issue receipts for taxes on lands situated in Borden County, stating as his reason therefor that it was an organized county, and returned to said agent the money so refused.
Appellant offered to pay appellee as tax collector of Borden County the amount of taxes appearing to be due on said lands for said year, as the same was extended by the Comptroller upon the basis of paying taxes upon lands in unorganized counties by nonresidents, and refused to pay the amount as shown by the assessment rolls of Borden County.
Error is assigned upon the conclusion of law, upon which the judgnient appealed from seems to be founded, that appellant had not made a valid rendition of its lands to the Comptroller prior to the organization of Borden County. We are not prepared to hold that the failure on the part of appellant to place the value upon its property or to swear to the list rendered the assessment invalid, provided the Comptroller accepted the rendition without objection on these grounds. Rev. Stats., art. 4706.
We are, however, of the opinion that the judgment must be sustained upon the broader ground, that upon the organization of Borden County and the levy and assessment of State and county taxes by the proper officers of that county within the time prescribed by law, the power of the Comptroller to proceed any further in the assessment and collection of taxes in Borden County was arrested. Const., art. 8, secs. 11, 12; Rev. Stats., arts. 4728, 4728a, secs. 1-6, 14-16; Folkerts v. Powers, 42 Mich., 285.
It seems to us, that in making the rendition to the Comptroller, appellant must be held to have contemplated, that under the Constitution and laws of this State, Borden County might become an organized county and assess and collect taxes, both State and county, for the year 1891. The organization and assessment having been accomplished prior to the 1st day of June of that year, appellant was not justified in refusing, after receiving timely notice, to bear its proportion of the burden of taxation; and there is nothing in its case which appeals to the equity powers of the court. If it had paid the taxes to the Comptroller prior to the organization of the county, a different question might be presented; the mere acceptance by the Comptroller of the list tendered did not, we think, exhaust the taxing power for that year.
It follows that the judgment must be in all things affirmed.

216296,The Saint Louis Cattle Company v. M. S. Vaught,1892-11-29,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
The appellee, Michael-S. Vaught, recovered, in the District Court of Mitchell County, in this action of trespass to try title, a judgment against the appellant for a section of land involved in this suit, and a further judgment in the sum of $78.95, the value of the use and occupancy of said land for two years prior to the .institution of said suit; From this judgment the appellant prosecutes this appeal.
The defendant pleaded a disclaimer as to the title and possession of the survey sued for, and denied possession of it.
Conclusions of fact. 1. Plaintiff was and is the owner of the section of land sued for.
2. Since May 4, 1887, two years prior to the institution of this suit, the land has been within the enclosure of the St. Louis Cattle Company.
- 3. The enclosure of said company is used by the same as a pasture, and the cattle of said company were permitted to graze upon the said survey in controversy, as well as upon any other portion of the land enclosed in their pasture — the outer boundaries of the tract sued for having never been fenced.
4. The rental value of the land in controversy, for the two years prior to the institution of the suit, is §78.95.
5. The pasture of the St. Louis Cattle Company consists of 75,000 or 100,000 acres of land, with a large number of cattle in the same.
6. Before the pasture was fenced by the company, the southern line thereof had been fenced by the Lucerne Cattle Company. A considerable portion of the eastern boundary thereof had also been fenced by the Lucerne Cattle Company, the fence so built being still owned by the Lucerne company.
7. A portion of the western boundary of the pasture had been fenced by the Iowa Cattle Company, and was and is still the property of said Iowa company. .
8. The St. Louis Cattle Company used these fences and assisted in keeping them in repair. The balance of the enclosure was fenced by said company in the spring of 1887, no part of said fence being upon the land sued for.
9. The St. Louis Cattle Company built and established gates, every three miles, around its pasture; and ingress and egress through said gates to and from the land sued for has never been denied to the plaintiff.
10. The St. Louis Cattle Companj' notified the agents of plaintiff that he could at any time take possession of his land, and protect and use the same, and that if enclosed within its pasture, this was only so done that the company might use and enjoy its own lands as a pasture, such being the purpose for which they were purchased, and that the company could not pay rent for the plaintiff’s tract, as it had been advised that"" it was not liable for rent, as demanded by plaintiff’s agents, under the circumstances of its enclosure.
The two assignments of error filed by the appellant complain of the action of the court in instructing the jury as shown by the third paragraph of its charge, and in refusing the special charge asked by the defendant. The third paragraph referred to is as follows:
Delivered November 29, 1892.
“If you find from the evidence that the defendant built and erected a fence completely enclosing a quantity of land, in which enclosure it embraced the survey sued for, and you find defendant is using the land sued for in the same manner it is using the other part of such larger enclosure, for the grazing of cattle, then the defendant is in possession of said survey No. 23; and if .you so find, you will also find for plaintiff the value (if any) of the use and occupation of said survey No. 23, for the time said survey lias been so embraced and used, not, however, giving the value of the use and occupation for a longer time than from May 4, 1887 [a date two years prior to the bringing of the suit], to the present time.”
The special charge referred to is as follows: “ If the defendant, in enclosing its own land, which surrounded the land of plaintiff, necessarily enclosed the land of plaintiff, but made no claim of title to same, and placed none of its fences on plaintiff’s land, and did not refuse plaintiff the use and occupation thereof, but offered him free access thereto, the plaintiff could not be allowed to recover rent. ’ ’
In this State, on account of the condition which has existed from time immemorial of the grazing lands, the owner of such property can not complain, as long as it remains a portion of the “ commons,” that the cattle of another should roam over it and graze upon it at will. Davis v. Davis, 70 Texas, 123; Buford v. Houtz, 133 U. S., 320. This doctrine, however, does not authorize the owner of cattle, by affirmative conduct on his part, to appropriate the use of such lands to his own benefit. He will not be permitted thus to ignore the truth that every one is entitled to the exclusive enjoyment of his own property. In this case, the appellant, by means of fences constructed or maintained by it, enclosed the land of the appellee in such manner as to reap from it those benefits which, as a rule, are incident exclusively to ownership. The use and enjoyment of the property under such circumstances imports necessarily the idea of liability.
The charge complained of involves the conclusions reached by us, and is therefore, in our opinion, proper. It hence follows, also, that the instruction requested was correctly refused.
The judgment is affirmed.

216226,Sam Lapowski v. James Smith et al.,1892-11-29,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
By this action appellant sought to recover of appellees lot 1, in block 13, in the city of Abilene. The petition was in the usual form of trespass to try title.
Appellee J. B. Leavell, one of the defendants below, after pleading the general denial, set up-that S. .H. Leavell, one of his codefendants, on the 30th of August, 1886, executed to him a deed to the property in controversey, which was intended to be a mortgage to secure a loan of $1000, and prayed to recover in this action the sum of money secured by said mortgage, with a foreclosure of the mortgage lien. No reply was filed by appellant to this answer and cross-action,
The 'cause was submitted to the court below without a jury upon an agreed statement of facts, which, so far as is important to be here set out, is as follows; the agreement being that the evidence would develop:
“ 1. That S. H. and S. K. Leavell conveyed lot 1, in block 13, in Abilene, Texas, to J. B. Leavell by deed dated August 30, 1886.
“ 2. That the said deed is an absolute warranty deed in form, but was intended by the parties as a mortgage to secure J. B. Leavell in the payment of a note for $1000, and interest.
“ 3. That in the fall of 1888, J. B. Leavell conveyed the said lot back to S. H. Leavell by deed of general warranty.
“ 4. That this deed was made with the verbal understanding that it was to enable S. H. Leavell to sell and convey as his own the said lot to Joseph Strickland, with whom he was negotiating a sale of all his property, including this lot, for a stock of hardware.
“ 5. That it was verbally agreed and understood between J. B. and S. H. Leavell, at the time of making the said deed and at the time said deed was put in the possession of said S. II. Leavell, that said deed was not to operate as a conveyance of a title to said S. H. Leavell, unless said sale to Strickland was consummated; and in the event S. H. Leavell should fail to make said sale, said deed was to be returned to J. B. Leavell. Plaintiff reserved the right to object to any evidence tending to modify or change the legal effect of this deed.
“ 6. That S. H. Leavell did fail to make said sale, and returned said deed in December, 1888, to J. B. Leavell.
“7. That S. Lapowski bought said lot at the execution sale on the -— day of-, on a judgment rendered in the County Court of Taylor : County, Texas, in the case of Mahoney & Evans v. S. & J. Lapowski, in which said S. & J. Lapowski recovered judgment over against S. II. Leavell. That at the time of said sale J. B. Leavell was in the possession of the property in controversy in this suit.
“8. That the Fort Scott Foundry and Machine Works obtained a judgment against Leavell and Swan and S. II. Leavell in Justice Court, Precinct No. 1, Taylor County, on March 4, 1889. That at the time of sale said J. B. Leavell was in the possession of this property.
“9. That this judgment was filed and recorded in the judgment record of Taylor County, March 21, 1889.
“ 10. That lot 1, block 13, was levied on and sold under this said judgment on the-day of May, 1889, at which sale S. Lapowski became the purchaser for the consideration of $20, and for which lot, under each of said execution sales, said S. Lapowski has proper deeds.”
Then follows a statement of facts relating to the history of and the amount due upon the notes secured by the deed of the 30th of August, 1886, clearly showing the same to have been a security for a debt, in which is found the additional statement that at the date of said instrument said J. B. Leavell was put in possession of said property by S. H. Leavell, and has remained in possession ever since.
Upon this statement of facts the trial court concluded that the conveyance from S. H. to J. B. Leavell was a mortgage, and that, before appellant could deprive J. B. Leavell of the possession of the property, he would have to pay the amount secured by said mortgage, and entered judgment accordingly, foreclosing the mortgage lien in favor of J. B. Leavell, with the right adjudged to appellant of paying the same off and recovering the possession of the property, from which judgment this appeal is prosecuted.
The first and second assignments of error assert the proposition that the conveyance from S. II. to J. B. Leavell was not a mortgage; but under the agreed statement of facts we can not so construe it, as it was clearly given to secure' a subsisting debt.
The remaining assignments assert, in different forms, the proposition that the conveyance from J. B. to S. H. Leavell, notwithstanding the verbal agreement and understanding to the contrary, took effect upon the delivery of the deed as an absolute conveyance of all the right and interest of J. B. Leavell in the property, whether as vendee or mortgagee, and that the subsequent return of said deed to him did not have the effect of reinstating his prior rights. It seems to be well settled, that a deed can not be delivered to the grantee as an escrow to take effect on a condition not appearing on its face. Heffron v. Cunningham, 76 Texas, 312; Lott v. Kaiser, 61 Texas, 665; Walker v. Renfro, 26 Texas, 142; And. Law Die., 413; 6 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 858, and cases cited in note.
It is also held, that a voluntary surrender or cancellation of a deed will not operate as a retransfer of the title; but the cases are conflicting as to whether such voluntary surrender or cancellation of an unregistered deed will estop the grantee and those subsequently claiming under him. Dev. on Deeds, secs. 303-305. We have not been cited to any case in this State in which this doctrine of estoppel is directly affirmed or denied.
In the case of Van Hook v. Simmons, 25 Texas Supplement, 324, it is held, that a parol agreement between the grantor and the grantee to destroy the deed of conveyance from the former to the latter, and to take back the land, would not destroy the effect of such conveyance and divest the estate of the latter, in the absence of proof of the actual destruction of the deed. It is expressly stated, in the opinion by Chief Justice Wheeler, that it was not necessary in that case to consider in what cases the cancellation of the deed would have effect and operate in the nature of a surrender to divest the estate.
In Stanley v. Epperson, 45 Texas, 654, in an opinion delivered by Moore, Associate Justice, this doctrine of estoppel was applied to a case where, by permission of all parties to the deed, the title was attempted to be conveyed from the grantee to a third party by an erasure of the grantee’s name and the substitution of that of the third party. While the weight of authority seems to be against the doctrine, it is well settled in Massachusetts and a few other States; and in that opinion of Judge Moore the case of Commonwealth v. Dudley, 10 Massachusetts, 430, is referred to with approval. If, therefore, the rule governing the conveyance of title to land should be deemed applicable to the mere release of the lien (which we do not decide), we would be inclined to adopt the principle announced in Stanley v. Epperson as applicable here, and to hold, that S. H. Leavell would be estopped from recovering the possession of the property in controversy after the voluntary surrender of the deed; and that appellant would likewise be estopped, as he would occupy no better position than S. H. Leavell, all his right having been acquired subsequent to the surrender of said deed, without showing any facts that would entitle him to occupy a superior position by virtue of the rights of an execution creditor, secured without notice, or of a bona fide purchaser.
We are of the opinion, however, that a decision of this question is not essential to a proper determination of the issues involved in this appeal. Although the question was not raised in the court below, and is not raised here, still' it is so obvious that we could not reverse and render a judgment for appellant on account of the deficiency in his pleading, that we must hold that no other judgment could properly have been rendered by the trial court than was rendered. His petition followed the statutory form in suits of this character, and contained nothing more. Appellee J. B. Leavell, by way of defense and cross-action, set up his debt and mortgage against S. H. Leavell and prayed a foreclosure, as he was bound to do in order to obtain that relief in this suit. Bosse v. Johnson, 73 Texas, 608. In answer to this, S. H. Leavell filed only a general denial, and appellant made no reply whatever. The case therefore comes clearly within the rule, that in an action of trespass to try title, where the defendant pleads specially his title and asks for affirmative relief, and plaintiff has matter' in avoidance, the proof of it will not be admitted, and if admitted, will not authorize a recovery by virtue thereof in the absence of its being alleged in his pleading.

Affirmed."
216247,"S. Jacobs, Bernheim & Co. v. G. W. Shannon et al.",1892-11-29,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
Plaintiffs in error brought this suit against defendant in error G. W. Shannon, as sheriff of Eastland County, and the sureties on his official bond, to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by the negligence of said Shannon in taking an insufficient claimant’s bond and delivering to Deland & Redfield, the claimants, a certain stock of merchandise which had been attached by plaintiffs in error as the property of one Caldwell.
The defects in the claimant’s bond, as alleged in plaintiffs’ petition, consisted of its being made payable to them jointly, instead of jointly and severally, with the plaintiffs in two other writs of attachment which had been also levied upon the same stock of goods; and also, it was alleged that the only sureties upon said bond were “ Randall & Darling,” which could at most only stand for one name, when the law required two.
The propositions presented by plaintiffs in error are so numerous, and present such slight shades of difference in the points sought to be made, that no useful purpose could be subserved in. attempting to treat them consecutively, and we shall therefore content ourselves with stating as concisely as possible our conclusions upon what we conceive to be the controlling points presented by the assignments of error.
We are of opinion that the court correctly submitted to the jury the question as to whether or not the claimant’s bond was signed by C. H. Higbee as a surety, in addition to Randall & Darling. The evidence as to whether Higbee’s name appeared upon this bond as a surety at the time it was accepted by the sheriff was conflicting and to a great extent circumstantial, and the question thus presented was peculiarly one for the jury to decide. The court correctly charged the jury as to the legal effect of the bond in case they found that it was signed by two sureties at the time it was accepted by the sheriff.
We are also of the opinion that the fact that the bond was made payable to plaintiffs in error jointly with the plaintiffs in the.other writs of attachment, instead of being made payable to them jointly and severally, was not objectionable. This form of bond is now prescribed by our statute (2 Say les’ Civil Statutes, article 4823), but before passage of this statute we think it was practically recognized as being proper by the decisions of our Supreme Court. Elser v. Graber, 69 Texas, 222; Harness Co. v. Schoelkopf, 71 Texas, 418.
We are also of opinion that the signature of a partnership as surety on a claimant’s bond for the trial of the right of property should be governed by the principles applicable to such signature to an attachment bond rather than to those applicable to an appeal bond. The reason given for holding an appeal bond invalid in the Supreme Court when signed by a firm as surety instead of by the individual members of the firm, is, that in that court no pleading can be filed showing the names of the members of the firm so that the court, if necessary, could render the proper judgment against them. Frees v. Baker, 6 S. W. Rep., 563. But in Donnelly v. Elser, 69 Texas, 282, these reasons are held not to be applicable to the case of an attachment bond, for the reason that* proper pleadings can be filed in the trial court upon which the judgment can be rendered, and we see no valid reason why this could not .be done upon the trial of the right of property.
The question as to whether or not the blanks in the claimant’s bond were properly filled up with the names of the plaintiffs in attachment, etc.,- by authority from the signers of this bond, after it was signed by them, was not requested by plaintiff in error to be submitted to the jury. If the signers of this bond authorized or understood that this was to be done at the time they signed and delivered it to Redfield in its imperfect condition, we think there can be no serious question as to its legality. Drake on Attach., sec. 336. If upon another trial there should be any question as to such authority, it should be submitted to the jury for their decision under appropriate instructions; but if plaintiffs in error desire this done, they must request charges upon the subject, as otherwise the failure on the part of the court would be one of omission and not of commission, and therefore would not constitute reversible error.
There can be no question that a claimant’s bond with but one security is not valid as a statutory bond. Our statute expressly requires that “ it shall be signed by two or more good and sufficient sureties.” Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 4823. We also think there can be but little doubt but that such bond in this State would be sustained as a common law obligation. Bank v. Lester, 73 Texas, 542; Jacobs v. Daugherty, 78 Texas, 682.
The court in submitting the case to the jury gave them the following charge:
“You are further charged that by the term 1 statutory bond’ as used in this charge is meant such a bond as is required by the statute of Texas, and such a one as will enable a claimant of personal property to contest the claim of plaintiffs in the attachment writ in the summary way for the trial of the right of property as provided by our law; and if in the execution and delivery of a bond to the officer who has levied on personal property by a claimant thereto, such a bond is executed and delivered as will create a binding obligation as against the persons signing their names thereto, but at the same time not such a bond as could be denominated a statutory bond, the effect in law of such action, if excepted to, would deprive the claimant of the right in said action to contest the plaintiff’s claim to the property the ownership of which is in controversy, but would not deprive the plaintiffs of their right to judgment against the claimant and surety, if one on the bond. You are further charged that the plaintiffs, even should you find that no other security except Randall & Darling signed said bond, would in the trial of said suit on the right of the ownership of said property have been entitled to a judgment against said Deland & Redfield, and said Randall & Darling; and if therefore you find that the plaintiffs in said suit negligently failed to take judgment against said Randall & Darling in said suit, and that said negligence proximately contributed to the injury sustained by plaintiffs; and if you further find that plaintiffs could with reasonable diligence have secured their said debt by prosecuting said cause to judgment and execution against the said Randall & Darling, or said Deland & Redfield, you will find for defendant.”
We think the court erred in this charge in telling the jury that the plaintiffs in the suit for the trial of the right of property had the right to take judgment against the security on the claimant’s bond if there was only one. Plaintiffs could take this summary judgment only upon a statutory bond; but if a recovery should be sought upon such bond as a common law obligation, suit would have to be brought thereon in the regular way. Jacobs v. Daugherty, 78 Texas, and Bank v. Lester, 73 Texas, cited above. We are therefore of the opinion that if the bond in controversy was not good as a statutory bond by reason of having only one surety thereon, the court was in error in submitting to the jury the question of contributory negligence on the part of plaintiffs in error, based upon their failure to make their money out of the security on such obligation. We think it quite too clear for argument that the plaintiff in attachment could not be required to accept a common law obligation in lieu of the statutory bond guaranteed him by the law, and thereby be subjected to the delays and uncertainty attending the prosecution of a suit thereon to its final termination. Such delay might be so great as to result in the entire release of the sheriff and his sureties by limitation.
It seems that the writ of attachment levied upon the stock of goods was also levied upon several tracts of land as the property of the defendant in the attachment, and the attachment lien thereon was foreclosed and the land ordered to be sold thereunder, but no steps had ever been taken to make such sales. The evidence also tended to show that this land, if it really belonged to the defendant in the attachment, was of value more than sufficient to pay plaintiff in error’s debt, and the court in its charge to the jury instructed them that, “If you believe from the evidence at the time the defendant G-. W. Shannon in this case turned over to Deland & Redfield the goods as alleged by plaintiffs, even if said Shannon as sheriff took an insufficient bond in the manner complained of by plaintiffs, nevertheless, if you further believe from the evidence that at the same time the plaintiffs had their attachment lien on said goods, that they also had a valid and subsisting lien upon other property of W. T. Caldwell sufficient to make their debt, and by their own neglect failed to make their said debt out of such other property, then and in that event plaintiff would be precluded from claiming anything from these defendants, and if you so believe you will find for them.”
We think there was no error in giving this charge. The rifle of liability on the part of an officer in cases like this is tersely stated by Mr. Drake in his work on Attachments, section 309, as follows: “ Where an officer fails to keep attached property to answer the execution, there is no reason why he should be subjected to a different rule of damages from that which prevails in actions generally against officers for neglect or failure of duty; that is, the actual injury sustained by plaintiff by reason of the neglect or failure. The value of the property attached, if less than the amount of the plaintiff’s judgment, or the amount of the latter where the value of the property is greater, will generally be prima facie the measure of damages, subject to be mitigated by evidence produced by the officer.” Also see 2 Sedg. on Dam., secs. 345, 346; Smith v. Tooke, 20 Texas, 750; Walton v. Compton, 28 Texas, 569; De Witt v. Oppenheimer, 51 Texas, 103; Hurlock v. Reinhardt, 41 Texas, 580; Barclay v. Scott, 1 Ct. App. C. C., 110, 111.
If the sheriff in this case had levied entirely upon personal property, and had only released a part thereof, we apprehend that it would not be contended that plaintiffs could hold the sheriff liable, without first subjecting such property as was not released to their claim, and could then only hold him liable for such part of his debt as might remain unsatisfied (De Witt v. Oppenheimer, cited above); and we can see no good reason why the same rule should not apply where part of the property levied on was real estate. If, however, upon another trial it should be made to appear that this land did not belong to the defendant in the attachment writ, or that his interest therein was of no value, or was exempt, or for any other reason was not subject to the attachment, the fact that plaintiffs had not sold the same would constitute no defense.
At the request of defendants in error the court below instructed the jury, that if the plaintiffs’ cause of action accrued to them more than four years next before the filing of their suit on the 24th day of March, 1886, the same would be barred by the statute of limitations, and they should find for the defendants. The court, however, added to this charge the qualification that the statute of limitations would not begin to run against the plaintiff in favor of the defendants until it was established by the decree of the District Court that the property levied upon was not the property of Deland & Redfield, but was the property of W. P. Caldwell, which latter date is shown by the undisputed evidence to have been June 15, 1885. If the claimant’s bond was only a common law obligation, we are not prepared to say that the statute of limitations did not commence to run until this latter date, but we think that even in such case it would not commence to run until the rendition of judgment in favor of plaintiffs in error against Caldwell for the amount of their debt. Until this latter date the sheriff could not be called upon to deliver the property in satisfaction of such debt. Zurcher v. Krohne, Feiss & Co., 63 Texas, 118; Poland v. Henry and Frazier, 64 Texas, 542; Murf. on Sheriffs, 962a. But this judgment was rendered on the 25th day of March, 1882, and this suit was instituted March 24, 1886, and it will therefore be seen that by the undisputed evidence four years had not elapsed between these dates, and we are therefore of the opinion that the court erred in submitting to the jury the question of limitation at all, although we are not prepared to say that this error, when coupled with the qualification made by the court below, would require a reversal of the case. There being no conflict in the evidence as to the date when the judgment was rendered upon the trial of the right of property, and such a short time having elapsed between such date and the institution of this suit, it would probably be unreasonable to suppose that the jury could have made the mistake of finding for the defendants upon this ground. It is, however, error to charge upon an issue not fairly raised by the evidence, and such error will frequently be sufficient to require a reversal. Railway v. Gilmore, 62 Texas, 391.
It will be noted that we have treated the case as though the name of Randall & Darling could, in no event, stand for more than one security. This was the view taken by the court below; and as there are no assignments of error calling the correctness of this in question, we have not deemed it proper to enter upon its investigation.
There is some evidence in the record which would tend to show that at the time of the signing of this bond the firm of Randall & Darling had been dissolved, and there are also some intimations in the record that both the former members of this firm were present when the bond was signed. If this be a fact, the question as to whether or not, upon proper pleading, this could have been shown to be the individual act of the members of this firm, so as to constitute two signatures to the bond, is of such importance that we would not undertake its decision without a full presentation of the question.
Delivered November 29, 1892.
For the error of the court in submitting to the jury the question of contributory negligence alleged to arise from the failure of plaintiffs in error to take judgment in the suit for the trial of the right of property on the claimant’s bond, even though it was only a common law obligation, we think the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial, and it is so ordered.
Reversed and remanded."
219086,E. F. Golson v. John A. Fielder,1893-02-01,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
October 12, 1888, appellant sued appellee, in trespass to try title, for 320 acres of land situated in Llano County. Appellee pleaded not guilty, stale demand, and that he was an innocent purchaser for value of the land sued for. The case below was tried by the court without a jury, and judgment rendered in favor of appellee.
1. Appellant and appellee, as common source of title, each claim the land under a deed executed July 19, 1878, by Mrs. R. T. Norwood and husband, P. T. Norwood, to James H. Rogers.
2. The deed recites, that the consideration for the transfer is “an assignment and transfer to Mrs. R. T. Norwood by James H. Rogers, agent of E. F. Golson & Co., of a certain judgment recovered by Golson xfe Co. against Norwood Bros., on the 4th day of May, 1874, §17,257.34, and Mrs. Norwood assuming plaintiff’s liability for the costs of suit.” The deed then proceeds to convey the land to James H. Rogers.
3. James H. Rogers was the attorney for E. F. Golson & Co. in obtaining the judgment against Norwood Bros, described in the deed.
4. For his services in obtaining the judgment, Rogers was to be paid 10 per cent thereof, and only received from Golson & Co. §200 before the deed was executed to him by Mrs. Norwood.
5. At the time the deed was executed by Mrs. Norwood, Rogers, as the agent and attorney of Colson & Co., executed and delivered to her a written assignment and transfer of the judgment mentioned in the deed as the consideration for the transfer of said land by Mrs. Norwood.
6. The transfer of the judgment to Mrs. Norwood and the purchase of the land by Rogers was upon the authority of a certain letter written by appellant E. F. Colson to Rogers, wherein he was empowered to make the-trade, and wherein it was agreed that if the trade was made, he, Rogers, was to receive one-half the land received in settlement of the judgment as balance due him on the fee.
7. At the time the letter was written and at the time the purchase of the land was made by Rogers, Colson & Co. had transferred to appellant all interest in the judgment, and he became the owner thereof and successor to the firm of Colson & Co.
8. The above deed from Norwood to Rogers was soon after its execution duly recorded in Llano County..
9. March 12, 1887, James H. Rogers, by deed, transferred the land toappellee, John A. Fielder.
10. At the time of the transfer by Rogers to Fielder, Fielder’s attorney inquired of Rogers as to the owvership of the land, and he was told that he (Rogers) owned the land.
11. Since the transfer to Rogers by Mrs. Norwood, he and Fielder have paid all taxes due on the land, and have claimed to own it.
12. The consideration for the land paid to Rogers by Fielder was a debt of about $590, due from Rogers to Fielder for merchandise sold Rogers by Fielder prior to purchasing the land, and about $50 cash paid at the time of the sale.
13. It does not appear from the evidence that Fielder had any notice (and the inference is from the testimony of Todd and Rogers that he did not have any notice, although lie himself does not testify) of the existence of the letter from appellant to Rogers authorizing him to transfer the judgment for the land, and also of the execution and existence of the transfer of the judgment, or of the contents of either of said instruments.
14. Appellant lives in Orange County, Virginia, and it does not appear that he ever lived in Texas, and it does not appear that he ever knew that Rogers was asserting an adverse claim or exclusive ownership to the land, or that he had paid taxes on it.
15. Rogers has never paid appellant any part of the consideration for the sale of the land, nor has appellant ever received any transfer to any part of the land, except as above stated, that was transferred to Rogers, by Norwood in consideration of the transfer of the judgment.
The court below, upon the facts as stated, found the following as its conclusions of law: “That the deed from Mrs. Norwood to James H. Rogers, conveying to him a fee simple title, was not, by reason of recitals of consideration, notice to Fielder that Rogers held the land or any part of it in trust for E. F. Golson; and being put upon inquiry by said recitals, the inquiries being pursued by his attorney, led to the conclusion that the title to all of said survey was absolutely vested in James H. Rogers. The said Fielder having paid a valuable consideration for the land, is an innocent purchaser in good faith, without notice of plaintiff’s claim, and judgment is rendered in favor of defendant.” .
This conclusion of the court below can not be sustained, for two reasons:
1. Because the recital upon the face of the deed from Mrs. Norwood and husband to James H. Rogers, that the consideration paid for the land was the transfer of the judgment in the case of Golson & Co. v. Norwood & Bro., by James H. Rogers as agent, had the effect to impress the legal title of the land held by Rogers with an express trust in favor of Golson & Co. The statement of this fact upon the face of the deed was sufficient to put a purchaser from Rogers upon notice that he held the legal title in trust for the true owner, and such purchaser would acquire the estate charged with such equitable title. The declaration made by Rogers to the attorney of appellee in selling the land, that he owned it, would not have the effect of defeating the equitable title disclosed by the deed under which he held. Appellee could not rely upon such declarations as having the effect as declared by the trial court. The declarations of Rogers asserting title in himself would not affect the rights of the true owner. And we know of no principle of law that permits a purchaser to rest his title, either legal or equitable, upon the declarations of the seller as affecting the title asserted by another.
2. Because the facts show, that the greater part of the consideration paid by Fielder for the land was a pre-existing debt due him by Rogers. Such a consideration can not be the basis of an innocent purchase except, to the extent of the amount actually paid at the time of the purchase» Overstreet v. Manning, 67 Texas, 660.
We think, under the facts as shown by the letter written to Rogers by Golson, by authority of which he acted in purchasing the land and transferring the judgment therefor, that Rogers was entitled to one-half of the land, and that appellee is likewise entitled to such extent by virtue of the deed executed to him by Rogers. The interest of appellee to this extent is virtually admitted by appellant in stating his third assignment of error.
In view of the disposition we make of the case, we deem it proper to say, that we do not think the facts of this case call for an application of the doctrine of stale demand.
The facts show that Rogers, at the time he took the conveyance to himself, was the agent and attorney for appellant; occupying this relationship, he would not be permitted to acquire title adverse to his principal, but he holds it charged with an express trust in favor of the party he represents.
Further, the facts show that by virtue of the terms of the letter from appellant under which he acted in purchasing the land, he, by reason of the purchase, became an owner in common with appellant.
In either case, whether as holder of the legal title charged with the express trust or as tenant in common, stale demand will not commence to run until an unequivocal act of repudiation or ouster asserted by him. Simply the payment of taxes will not amount to an ouster or repudiation of the title of the true owner, nor will the assertion of claim to the entire tract have that effect, unless notice of such fact is brought home to the other cotenant or owner. 13 Am. and Eng. Encycl. of Law, 688; Phillipson v. Flynn, 83 Texas, 581.
For the reasons indicated, we reverse the judgment below, and here render judgment in favor of appellant for one-half of the land sued for, and for all costs of suit, together with the costs of this appeal.
Reversed and rendered.

216295,"The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. W. C. Wright",1892-11-29,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
Appellee having a large number of beef cattle which he desired to ship to Chicago, made a verbal contract with appellant’s agent at Sanger, a station on its road in Denton County, to have the necessary cars and engine ready for him on the morning of November 8, 1889;'and relying upon this contract, he drove his cattle from his pasture to said station, where they arrived at about 11 a. m. Appellant had the necessary cars in compliance with his contract, but no engine at said station to handle the same, and appellee was compelled to put his cattle in the pens of appellant, which were very muddy, where they remained until about 2 or 3 o’clock of the morning of the 9tli. For the damages thus received appellee instituted this suit and recovered judgment for the sum of $1040.
On the trial of the case in the court below, appellee was permitted to ask several of his witnesses, “ How much, in their opinion, the cattle were damaged per head by reason of the fact that they remained in the muddy pens of the company thirteen hours on a cold, damp day and night, and did without food or something to eat from early Friday morning until about 9 or 10 o’clock Saturday night?” to which the defendant objected, for the reason that the opinion of the witness as called for respecting the damage per head was improper and misleading, and the testimony of the witnesses should have been confined to facts, leaving the jury to determine the amount of damage per head. The witnesses, in answer to this question, stated from the best of their knowledge it would be from $3 to $4 per head.
We think the action of the court in admitting this evidence was error, for which the judgment.will have to be reversed. In this case these witnesses should have been allowed to state- the effect the treatment mentioned in the question would have had upon the cattle, in reducing their weight and in affecting their saleable value in the several items alleged in the plaintiff’s petition, leaving the jury to estimate the amount-of damage resulting from these causes. From the general answer of these witnesses, giving the gross amount of damage per head, we are unable to state that in arriving at this amount they confined themselves to the legitimate items of damage to be taken into consideration in making the estimate. As to what is the effect of a given kind of treatment upon an animal, either in reducing or increasing its weight, or in injuring or benefiting its appearance, is a proper matter of opinion to be stated by a witness to the jury; but as to whether these several items constitute the legal damage in a given case, and the amount of such damage, the jury must decide under proper instructions from the court. Railway v. Great-house, 82 Texas, 109; Kauffman & Runge v. Babcock, 67 Texas, 241; Clardy v. Callicoate, 24 Texas, 170.
We think the court did not err in refusing to charge the jury that it would devolve upon plaintiff to prove authority on the part of defendant’s station master to make the alleged verbal contract to furnish the engine and cars. This question has recently been fully considered by our Supreme Court. Easton v. Dudley, 78 Texas, 236; McCarty v. Railway, 79 Texas, 33; Railway v. McCarty, 82 Texas, 608.
We find no error in the charge of the court as set forth in appellant’s fourth assignment of which it has just cause of complaint. We do not find it to be a charge’ upon the weight of the evidence, or objectionable in failing to use the term “ market value;” but, on the contrary, we regard it as a very clear exposition of the law of the case, in so far as it did not admit of any recovery against appellant not authorized by the law.
Upon the trial of the case in the court below it was shown that after the cattle were loaded in the cars, and just as the journey was commencing, appellee signed a written contract for the shipment of said cattle, in which the following clauses appear:
“ 2. The shipper agrees to waive and release, and does hereby release, the company from any and all liability for or on account of any delay in shipping said stock after the delivery thereof to its agent, and from any delay in receiving the same after tender or delivery, and for breach of any alleged contract to furnish cars at any particular time; and the shipper hereby releases and does waive and bar any and all cause of action for any damage whatsoever that has occurred to the shipper by any written or verbal contract prior to the execution hereof, concerning said stock or any of them.”
“9. That for the consideration aforesaid said shipper further agrees, that as a condition precedent to his right to recover any damages for any loss or injury to his said stock during the transportation thereof, or at any place or places where the same may be loaded or unloaded on the company’s road, or previous to loading thereof for shipment, he, they, or his or their agents in charge of the stock will give notice in writing of his claim therefor, specifying the nature of the claim to its station master, at said last named station on the company’s road, before said stock is removed from said station, and before the same shall have been removed, slaughtered, or intermingled with other stock, and will not move said stock from said station until the expiration of three hours after the giving of such notice, to the end that such claim may be fully and fairly investigated; and that a failure to fully comply with the terms of this clause shall be a complete bar to any recovery of any and all such damages. The written notice herein provided for can not and shall not be waived by any person except such station master, and by him only in writing.”
Appellant requested the court to instruct the jury that by this contract appellee had waived and released all claim for damages accruing to the cattle before the execution of the same, and in its sixth assignment complains at the refusal of the court to give this instruction.
In the case of Railway v. McCarty, 82 Texas, 608, because there was no evidence of any consideration for such waiver introduced upon the trial, it was held that the court did not err in disregarding this clause in the written contract in question in that case. We are unable to say from the report of that case whether there was any proper plea of a want of consideration for such written contract or not, but suppose such plea was filed, as no question was raised thereon. In this case appellee filed no 2)1 ea of want of consideration, and in such state of the pleading we are of opinion that the written contract made the basis of appellant’s answer imported a sufficient consideration, which could Only be called in question by a proper plea, supported by affidavit.
Delivered November 29, 1892.
Article 4488 of the Revised Statutes provides that “ every contract in writing hereafter made shall be held to import a consideration, in the same manner and as fully as sealed instruments have heretofore done,” and by subdivision 10 of article 1265 of the Revised Statutes it is required that an answer setting up that a written instrument upon which a ¡heading is founded is without consideration, or that the consideration of the same has failed in whole or in p>art, shall be verified by affidavit; and we see no reason why these provisions of our statute should not be held to apply to the contract ¡headed in this case.
Appellant also requested the court to charge the jury, that if they believed from the evidence that, in the exercise of ordinary diligence, the agent of the plaintiff could have served the written notice or claim of damage on defendant’s station master at Purcell, and failed to do so, to . find for the defendant, and in its seventh assignment complains of the refusal of the court to give such charge.
Appellant in its brief has not called our attention to the particular clause in this contract which it claims required the giving of notice to its agent at Purcell. It might be, however, that the expression that notice should be given “ to its station master at said last named station” refers to Purcell as such station. If this be'a correct interpretation of the contract, we are of opinion that the court, in view of the allegation in appellant's answer that its agent at Purcell was known to ap>p>ellee, and was easily accessible, should have given this charge. The jury, however, in passing upon the reasonableness of such requirement, would be authorized to take into consideration the length of time the cattle were stopped at Purcell, and the facilities afforded appellee for giving this notice, and all of the attendant circumstances. If appellant relied upon this clause in its contract as being reasonable, it would be its duty to afford reasonable time, opportunity, and other facilities for compflying therewith; and as to whether this was done in the particular instance would be a question for the jury to decide. Railway v. Childress & Co., ante, 302, and authorities therein cited.
For the errors above indicated the judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.

219175,"District School Trustees, etc., v. W. W. Wimberly",1893-02-01,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
Plaintiffs, H. M. Patterson, J. B. Shields, and W. ICeesey, in their corporate capacity as district trustees of district number 1, and county of Jeff Davis, State of Texas, brought this suit to restrain W. W. Wimberly, county judge of Jeff Davis County, and his successors in office, from apportioning to school district number 2 the sum of $25.98, and all other available school funds to which district number 1 would thereafter be entitled as the pro rata of said funds for the children within scholastic age residing upon the A. S. Lewis survey. The school trustees of district number 2, being parties in interest in their corporate capacity, were made parties defendant.
Plaintiffs in their petition allege, that for about two years prior to the 26th day of March, 1889, Jeff Davis County had been divided into two school districts. In pursuance of an expressed desire of a majority of the voters of the two districts, the Commissioners Court at a special term, on the 26th day of March, 1889, recfistricted said county, and by orders duly entered on the minutes of the court, created three school districts, defined them by boundaries, and numbered them 1, 2, and 3, respectively; and that on the 14th day of August, 1¿89, the court, without having obtained the consent of the voters of districts numbers 1 and 2, and in violation of the law, changed the lines between the two districts so as to detach from district number 1 the A. S. Lewis survey number 6 and attach it to district number 2. Defendant Wimberly recognized the change made by the court, and apportioned the pro rata of the school fund for the children residing on the Lewis survey to district number 2. This survey is very populous on account of the military post at Fort Davis being located on it; it contains 640 acres of land, and the number of children residing on it and enrolled in district number 1 for the year 1889-90 was twenty-seven.
At the time of commencing this suit there was about to be paid into the county treasury the sum of 8774.90, available school fund for the county for the year 1889-90. Of this sum plaintiffs allege that $25.90 was due and should be apportioned to district number 1 as the pro rata of said fund for ten of the children residing on the Lewis survey, and not theretofore transferred to district number 2 by defendant Wimberly, and that unless restrained from so doing, Wimberly would apportion this sum to district number 2, and would apportion all other school funds to which district number 1 was entitled as the pro rata of the children within scholastic age residing on the Lewis survey.
Defendants answered by general denial, and by special plea, that the county was redistricted on the 26th of March, 1889, only for the purpose of giving the town of ""Valentine and surrounding country better school facilities; that the Lewis survey had prior to this time been in district number 2; that the duty of designating the boundaries was by the court entrusted to one of the commissioners, a surveyor by profession, and that he availed himself of his superior knowledge of the boundary lines between the various tracts of land, and with intent to deceive the court, changed the lines between districts numbers 1 and 2 as they had formerly existed, and detached the Lewis survey from district number 2 and attached it to district number 1, and thereby deceived three of the commissioners; that on the 28th day of March, and before the adjournment of the term of court, an order was passed by the court to reconsider its action in designating the boundaries between districts numbers 1 and 2, and on the 13th day of August, 1889, in pursuance of the order to reconsider, changed the line between districts numbers 1 and 2 so as to include the Lewis survey in district number 2, where it was intended in the order of March 26, 1889, it should be.
The case was tried before the court, and resulted in a judgment for the defendants dissolving the injunction, and for costs.
We find the facts to be as follows:
1. That prior to March 15, 1889, the county of Jeff Davis was divided into two school districts, which were numbered 1 and 2.
2. That on March 16, 1889, an election was held to change these two districts and redistrict the county; that in this election a majority of all the legal voters in all the districts voted in favor of changing and redistricting.
3. On March 19 the County Commissioners Court of Jeff Davis County canvassed the result of the election, and ascertained by a count of the votes that a majority of all the voters in all the districts to be affected had voted in favor of changing and redistricting, and so declared in their order entered of record on said date.
4. In pursuance of the result of the election above mentioned, the County Commissioners Court on March 26, 1889, changed the old districts and redistricted the county into three districts, and numbered them 1,2, and 3, and prescribed the metes and bounds of each district as the law required; and in the order establishing the metes and bounds of these three districts, survey number 6 was included in district number 1.
5. That before the change and redistricting said survey number 6 had always been in district number 2, and the county judge and three of the commissioners were not aware that by the change it was taken from number 2 and placed in number 1. Nor was it their desire or intention that it should be changed from district number 2 to district number 1.
6. The county commissioners ascertaining that survey 6 had been changed from district number 2 into district number 1, on March 28, 1889 (two days after entering the order establishing the metes and bounds of the three districts, and at the same term that order was entered, and before the minutes had been approved), the court passed an order reconsidering the order by which the boundaries had been established between districts 1 and 2.
7. In pursuance of the order reconsidering the order establishing the boundaries between districts 1 and 2, the county commissioners, at their session on August 14, 1889, established the boundary lines between districts 1 and 2 so as to place survey number 6 in district number 2, where it had always been before, and where the county judge and three commissioners intended it to be and thought it was.
8. At the time the order was passed on March 28, 1889, reconsidering the order passed on March 26, 1889, defining the boundaries of the school districts, there were present the county judge, Wimberly, and three commissioners.
9. The copies of the proceedings and orders of the Commissioners Court recite that Commissioners Dawson, Grierson, and Thompson were present on said 28th day of March, 1889, and'is silent as to who else was present.
10. The county judge, Wimberly, testified that he was present at said time and acted with the three commissioners in holding court, but did not vote on the question of reconsidering the order made on March 26, 1889.
The first error assigned complains of the evidence of County Judge Wimberly, showing that he was present and formed a part of the Commissioners Court on the 28th day of March, 1889, when the order reconsidering the order made on March 26, establishing the boundaries of the school districts, was passed, for the reason that this fact could only be shown by the minutes of the court, and that paroi evidence for this purpose was not admissible. The evidence objected to did not tend to contradict the record, but was simply explanatory of it. The minutes of the court for that day simply showed that three commissioners, naming them, were present, but did not say that any one else required by law as necessary to constitute a part of the court was not present. The failure of the record of the proceedings of the Commissioners Court to state that the county judge Was present was evidently an oversight of the clerk in preparing the minutes of the court. The evidence was properly admitted. The county judge being present with the three commissioners, constituted a full court for the transaction of business as required by law.
The two comissioners having voted for the proposition to reconsider the previous order fixing the boundaries of the several districts, it was not necessary that the county judge should cast his vote in order to give the vote validity. The court had the right at the same session to change its orders made at that term of the court.
This disposes of all the assignments of error. We find no error in the record, and affirm the judgment.

216219,The Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. A. M. Shipman,1892-11-29,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
This suit was instituted by appellee in the Justice Court for Precinct No. 1, Denton County, Texas, to recover of appellant $145 damages, alleged to have been caused him by the killing by appellant of one mare of the value of $75 and one horse of the value of $70. Judgment was rendered in favor of appellee in the Justice Court for the sum of $125, and the case was taken by appellant by appeal to the County Court, and in that court judgment was rendered in favor of appellee for the sum of $145.
There is nothing in the transcript showing what the pleadings of the parties were either in the Justice or County Court.
Article 1573 of the Revised Statutes provides that, “The pleadings in the Justice Court shall be oral, except where otherwise specially provided, but a brief statement thereof shall be noted on the docket.” Without something in the record to apprise us what the issues between the parties were, as contained in their pleadings, whether they be oral or written, it is impossible for us to pass upon errors assigned to charges given and refused, or to the admission or rejection of evidence, and we will not undertake to do so. This has long been the practice in this State. Maass v. Solingsky, 67 Texas, 290; Moore v. Jordan, 67 Texas, 394; Silberberg v. Trilling, 82 Texas, 523.
As we are unable to see from the record that appellant suffered any injury from the action of the court in the several matters complained of in its assignment of errors, the judgment of the court below must be affirmed.

216190,W. Y. Robertson v. Schneider & Davis,1892-11-29,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This writ of error was prosecuted by W. Y. Robertson to the Court of Appeals from a judgment rendered in the County Court of Hill County, against Tom Sanders as principal and said Robertson and another as sureties on an injunction bond. On May 9, 1891, the judgment was affirmed by an oral opinion of the Court of Appeals, and a rehearing was granted.
Defendants in error, Schneider & Davis, in 1884, brought an attachment suit in Johnson County against Hudspeth & Co., in which they caused to be seized under a writ of attachment the property of said Hudspeth & Co. in Johnson County, and also certain alleged property of said Tom Sanders, in Hill County. Sanders, after an ineffectual attempt, by a proceeding under the statute for the trial of the rights of property, to wrest the Hill County property from the attachment levied thereon, in the spring of 1885 obtained a writ of injunction, with plaintiff in error as one of his sureties on the injunction bond, by which injunction writ the judgment rendered against him in the suit for the trial of the rights of property in the sum of three hundred and odd dollars was enjoined. After this injunction was obtained, defendants in error recovered judgment in their attachment suit in Johnson County against Hudspeth & Co. for several hundred dollars, to which was applied a credit — resulting from the sale of the property attached in that county — which reduced the amount due on that judgment to about $250. Thereafter, on the 17th day of March, 1887, a judgment was rendered, from which this writ of error is prosecuted, dissolving said injunction, and against said Tom Sanders and his sureties on the injunction bond, W. Y. Robertson and E. Y. Taylor, in the sum of $252.52, the amount remaining unpaid on the Johnson County judgment. As a ground for this recovery, Schneider & Davis alleged in their answer the amount due them upon the Johnson County judgment, without alleging any damage or injury resulting from the granting of the injunction.
Delivered November 29, 1892.
The record contains no statement of facts, although the trial seems to have been upon both pleading and proof. It is perfectly clear, however, under the well settled rule adopted by our Supreme Court, that the judgment is without support in the pleadings, and must therefore be reversed. Reasons for this conclusion may be found in the following cases, to-wit: Railway v. White, 57 Texas, 130; Avery & Son v. Stewart, 60 Texas, 154; Ferguson v. Herring, 49 Texas, 130; Fernandez v. Casey, 77 Texas, 452.
The judgment will therefore be reversed and the cause remanded.

216235,A. W. Heller v. The City of Alvarado,1892-11-29,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This action was originally brought in a Justice Court of Johnson County, by the City of Alvarado against appellant, to recover $150 as license tax imposed by said city upon the occupation of a retail liquor dealer. Appellee sued as a municipal corporation, claiming to be duly incorporated under the laws of the State. Appellant filed a written plea in the Justice Court, termed by him a plea to the jurisdiction, in which he set up that the court was without jurisdiction to entertain a suit to collect taxes, and in support of this position alleged, that the ordinance levying the tax was invalid for want of the two-thirds majority of the city council in its adoption, and that the ordinance which directed the suit to be brought against this appellant (naming him) for a failure to pay occupation taxes was a discrimination against him, though alleged to have been enacted for his especial benefit. This plea also alleged that a criminal prosecution had been instituted in the Mayor’s Court of said city of Alvarado on account of the nonpayment of these taxes, in which a fine had been adjudged against appellant, from which an appeal had been taken to the County Court, where the prosecution was still pending. This plea was sworn to. In addition, appellant answered, setting up that appellee had attempted to adopt as its charter the general law providing for the charter of cities and towns of over 1000 inhabitants, but that this was ineffectual, because not adopted by a two-tliirds majority of the city council. This plea was not sworn to, nor was there any plea filed by appellant in writing and sworn to which denied that appellee was a corporation as claimed by it.
Delivered November 29, 1892.
The appellee recovered judgment in the Justice Court for §150, and on appeal in the County Court, for §150 and §6.25 interest, from which last judgment this appeal is prosecuted.
We conclude that, in the absence of a sworn plea denying that the city of Alvarado was a corporation, the court did not err in overruling this defense of appellant. We are also of the opinion that the evidence warranted the County Court in the finding that the ordinance imposing the tax was legally enacted, and that under article 433 of the Revised Statutes the city of Alvarado could maintain a suit to recover the taxes. We, however, find no authority for said city to recover interest in addition to the taxes. This part of the judgment therefore can not be sustained. Cave v. Houston, 65 Texas, 622; Tel. Co. v. The State, 55 Texas, 319; Galveston v. Heard, 54 Texas, 420; Edmonson v. Galveston, 53 Texas, 157.
For authorities in support of the power of the city to maintain the suit for taxes, see Howard v. Mayor, 59 Texas, 77, and the above case cited in 65 Texas. We are of opinion that the pendency of the criminal prosecution was not a bar to this action, this remedy being cumulative, and it not being shown that the criminal prosecution had resulted in the collection of said taxes.
It is concluded that the judgment should be reformed by omitting therefrom the recovery of interest, and affirmed in the recovery of the amount of the taxes, and that the costs of this appeal be adjudged against appellee.

216289,Sanger Brothers and The Martin Brown Company v. H. M. Henderson,1892-11-30,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This appeal is prosecuted by Sanger Bros, and the Martin Brown Company from a verdict and judgment rendered against them and K. V. Northington jointly, in the District Court of Taylor County, on the 10th day of March, 1888, in favor of H. M. Henderson, trustee, for the use and benefit of J. W. Carter and Fechheimer Bros. & Co., in the sum of $15,146.22, for the alleged conversion by them jointly of a stock of merchandise conveyed and delivered by Donovan & Wylie to said Henderson on the 26th day of July, 1884, in trust, to secure certain debts then about to become due to said Carter, Fechheimer Bros. & Co., and others, from said Donovan & Wylie.
We find from the record that on said 26th day of July, 1884, said Donovan & Wylie, who were then engaged in mercantile business in the town of Abilene, Texas, being in a failing condition and desirous of securing certain preferred creditors, at the instance of said J. W. Carter, who was one of said creditors, and at the instance of a surety for said Donovan & Wyíie to said Fechheimer Bros. & Co., also a firm of said creditors, made, executed, and delivered to said Henderson, with the knowledge and assent of said Carter and of said surety, but without the knowledge or consent of said Fechheimer Bros, and Co., or any of the other beneficiaries, a certain instrument in writing, by which said Donovan & Wylie conveyed to said Henderson in trust their entire stock of goods then situated in Abilene, to secure and enforce the payment of the several debts then about to become due to the creditors therein named, including said J. W. Carter and Fechheimer Bros. & Co.; and authorized said trustee to sell said property if said debts, or any part thereof, should not be paid at maturity, and apply the proceeds of such sale to the payment of said several debts in full, if sufficient for that purpose, and if not, then ratably; balance, if any, to be paid back to said Donovan & Wylie. We find that contemporaneously with the execution of said instrument, termed a deed of trust, said Henderson was placed in the actual and exclusive possession of said entire stock of goods, and that thereafter said Northington, in the capacity of sheriff of Taylor County (which office he then held), on said 26th day of July, 1884, levied a writ of attachment, at the instance of the attorney for Sanger Bros., on a portion of said stock of goods, to-wit, a lot of clothing valued at $3211.60, which attachment was issued out of the County Court of Taylor County in favor of said Sanger Bros, against said Donovan & Wylie, to collect a debt of $838.17, which said Donovan & Wylie owed to said Sanger Bros.; that at the time of making this levy said sheriff demanded and obtained from said Henderson the keys to said store house and took actual possession of said entire stock of goods, and that the proof tended to show that said «attorney for Sanger Bros, was present at said store at the time; that said sheriff, continuing in the exclusive possession of said entire stock of goods, a few hours thereafter levied an attachment against said Donovan & Wylie in favor of Middleton & Daugherty on said entire stock of goods, subject to the prior levy for Sanger Bros.; and on the following day (July 27), while still in possession, levied an attachment writ upon said entire stock of goods, subject to prior levies, in favor of the Martin Brown Company against said Donovan & Wylie, which attachment issued out of the District Court of Taylor County, to collect a debt of $3574.27 which said Donovan & Wylie owed said Martin Brown Company; that the return on the first attachment levied stated that it was levied upon said clothing, attaching an inventory thereof, and the returns on the Other two attachments recited that they were made on the entire stock of goods, subject to the prior levy of Sanger Bros, on the same property; that the stock of goods remained in the hands of said sheriff till his successor in office acquired the possession thereof; that thereafter the attachment liens were foreclosed, Sanger Bros.’ attachment upon the clothing as described in the return on that writ, and the other attachments, to-wit, the Martin Brown Company attachment and subsequent attachments, on the entire stock of goods subject to the prior levy of Sanger Bros., the Middleton & Daugherty suit having been dismissed a few days after the attachment was levied: that under these judgments of foreclosure separate orders of sale were issued, but the entire stock of goods was advertised and sold by the proper officer of Taylor County under the order of sale issued in the Martin Brown Company suit, and the proceeds of such sale distributed among the different plaintiffs in said suits, Sanger Bros, being first paid; that appellants were paid by remittances tó their attorneys in Fort Worth. The record does not disclose at whose instance the sale and distribution of the proceeds were made, nor what knowledge, if any, Sanger Bros, and the Martin Brown Company had, in receiving their respective parts of the proceeds of said sale, of the manner in which the property had been sold and the proceeds distributed.
We fail to find in the record any evidence of an agreement or understanding between Sanger Bros, and the Martin Brown Company that they would act together in having said foreclosure sale made and share together the benefits of the same.
Appellee alleged the capacity in which he held said stock of goods at the date of the seizure as disclosed above, but failed to allege the acceptance of the provisions of said deed of trust on the part of any of the beneficiaries prior to said levies; and his petition was specially excepted to on this ground. He also alleged that appellants acted together in causing the seizure and conversion of the entire stock of goods, of the alleged value of $23,714.73, and, as measure of damages, set out the amount of his commissions and the debts due to said Carter and Fechheimer Bros. & Co., respectively, and prayed to recover in his own behalf and in the capacity of trustee as well as for the use and benefit of said Carter and Fechheimer Bros. & Co. His petition was specially excepted to for misjoinder of causes of action and nonjoinder of the beneficiaries in said deed of trust. The exceptions were all overruled and the points duly reserved ; but the court on the trial eliminated the issue of a recovery in his own behalf, and submitted his right to recover in the other capacity upon the theory that the recovery should be apportioned amongst the accepting beneficiaries in said deed of trust according to the amount of their respective debts, and that it should be limited to the amount of said debts, if less than the value of the goods converted. The court also charged the jury substantially as follows: If you find that ‘1 Sanger Bros, and the Martin Brown Company acted in concert and together, and so acting the Martin Brown Company sued out, or caused to be sued out, the order of sale under which the goods were sold, it being understood and agreed between them at the time that they would participate in and together share the benefits of such sale, and after the sale did in fact share the benefits thereof, and that thereby the value of said goods was wholly lost to said trustee and accepting beneficiaries,” they would all be liable; of which charge appellants complain on the ground that there was no evidence to warrant it. On a former trial of the cause appellee, upon discovering a variance between the description of his deed of trust ^contained in his petition and the instrument itself when offered in evidence, was permitted to withdraw his announcement of ready for trial and have the cause withdrawn from the jury after two witnesses to the execution of the deed of trust had testified, of which complaint is also made, based upon a plea in bar of this action.
It is earnestly contended by appellants that appellee can not maintain this suit without also joining with him the several beneficiaries named in said trust deed, and we have been cited to a great many authorities upon this question. In our opinion they are entirely inapplicable, being mostly cases where beneficiaries in deeds of trust are held to be necessary or proper parties, according to the well established rules of equity.
This is an action at law for the conversion of the goods, and the ancient maxim of the common law, that possession is title as against a wrongdoer, is more applicable. It is true that the instrument under which Henderson took possession of said goods did not vest in him the legal title, but only created a lien upon the property for the benefit of the beneficiaries therein named; but it is also true that his possession under said instrument was in the nature of a pledge, and entitled him to maintain an action against a trespasser, though the title was not in him. See Jones on Pledges, sec. 10, 12, 434. Osborn v. Koenigheim, 57 Texas, 91, and subsequent cases.
It is well settled that an attaching creditor who causes property held in pledge to be seized and taken from the possession of the pledgee is a trespasser within the meaning of this rule'. In such case the measure of damages is the full value of the goods, without reference to the amount of the debts secured by the pledge. Jones on Pledges, secs. 433, 434; Treadwell v. Davis, 34 Cal., 601; Thompson v. Toland, 48 Cal., 100; Osborn v. Koenigheim, above, and subsequent cases.
In this case the record discloses that at least one, if not two, of the beneficiaries assented to the mortgage and pledge prior to the levies. We do not think that the force of the acceptance by Carter’s agent and attorney was at all affected by the subsequent expressions of indignation and dissatisfaction on Carter’s part at not being better secured. It is not necessary, therefore, to decide whether or not the acceptance by the trustee alone, prior to the levies, was sufficient, and we do not decide that question, but call attention to the alleged defect in the petition in this respect as disclosed in the above conclusions of fact.
If the trust deed and pledge are not vitiated by fraud, as alleged by appellants, we hold that appellee is entitled to maintain this suit under the facts disclosed in this record for the full value of the stock of goods, without reference to the amount of the debts secured.
We are of opinion, however, that the court below erred in giving the charge quoted above, because we find no evidence in the record that appellants sued out or caused to be sued out the order of sale under which the goods were sold in pursuance of an understanding and agreement between them at the time that they would participate in and together share the benefits of such sale; and for this reason we feel constrained to reverse the judgment appealed from.
It seems to us that if appellee relied on any such agreement and understanding to show a joint liability, he should have produced some evidence of it, the burden being on him to show the alleged concert of action. It must have been easily within his power to have proven by the officers who issued and executed said process the facts attending the issuance and execution thereof, at least to the extent of showing who caused it to be done, there being other parties interested besides appellants.
It seems to us that the sale by Sheriff Cunningham of the entire stock of goods in bulk under the order issued upon the judgment in favor of the Martin Brown Company, and the distribution of the proceeds of said sale amongst the several attaching creditors, including Sanger Bros., in the absence of any proof as to why he pursued this course, should be deemed a mere irregularity on his part, and not proof tending to show an agreement or understanding between appellants.
The action of the court below in permitting appellee, on a former trial, to withdraw his announcement of ready after his testimony in part had been introduced, and in discharging the- jury, is not deemed to have been an abuse of discretion.
Very many other questions are raised by the assignments and propositions of appellants, all of which have been carefully considered, but as they may not arise upon another trial we decline to pass upon them.
On the ground stated above the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.

219161,Lewis H. Lambert et al. v. Williams & Russell,1893-02-01,"KEY, Associate Justice.
Appellees, Williams & Russell, as plaintiffs, brought this suit against L. H. Lambert, Tom Harrison, and William Coit as defendants, to recover $611.49 on open account against Lambert, and to foreclose a mechanic’s lien on a certain house and lot in the city of San Antonio as against all the defendants. Wm. Cameron & Co. filed a plea of intervention, claiming the house and lot as their own, alleging that they acquired title thereto through defendants Lambert and Harrison, and asking to have their title quieted, and in the alternative for a decree establishing a lien in their favor for a debt owing from Lambert and Harrison to them.
The case was tried before a jury, and plaintiffs recovered judgment for the full amount sued for and decree establishing and foreclosing a lien on the house and lot; and intervenors recovered judgment for $900 and decree establishing and foreclosing a lien on the same property. Neither lien was accorded priority, and the judgment directs, that if the property should not sell for sufficient to pay both debts, that the proceeds be pro rated between plaintiffs and intervenors, Cameron & Co.
Cameron & Co. filed a motion for a new trial, which was overruled, and they have appealed. Lambert and Harrison filed no motion for a new trial, but gave notice of appeal, filed appeal bonds, and filed joint assignments of error with Cameron & Co.
The second assignment of error reads thus: “ The court erred in giving charge number 2 as requested by plaintiffs.” There are several other assignments of error, no more specific than the one just quoted. These assignments are too general to require consideration.
An assignment of error, to be sufficient, must distinctly specify .the grounds of error relied on. A number of objections may be urged to the action of the court in giving a particular charge. It may enunciate a radically unsound principle of law; or it may be abstractly correct, but inapplicable to the facts of the particular case; or it may be upon the weight of testimony. Hence an assignment of error thereon should in some manner, however briefly, indicate the reason why the complaining party charges that error was committed in giving a charge.
The reason for the rule'may not apply with as much force when it is sought to predicate error upon the refusal to give a certain charge asked. But even then it may reasonably be expected, if not required, that in addition to charging that there was error in refusing to give the instruction asked, the assignment will state that it was applicable to a stated phase of the case, unless it be such a charge as applies alike to all cases, and that it was not embraced in the main charge. Rev. Stats., art. 1037; Sup. Ct. rule 24; Robertson v. Coates, 1 Texas Civ. App., 664.
There was no reversible error in permitting appellee R. H. Russell to state, as a witness, the amount for which he had sold certain lots acquired by the firm of Williams & Russell under an execution sale on their former judgment against Lambert. If the defendants or interveners in the court below could have shown a satisfaction of the former judgment against Lambert, the plaintiffs would not, perhaps, have been entitled to recover as much as they sued for. But in so far as the lots about which Russell testified could have had any bearing upon that question, the net proceeds of their sale by the sheriff, in the absence of fraud on the part of the plaintiffs, would have been the amount to have been credited on the former judgment, and not the real value of the lots. So, as the matter appears in the record, the testimony complained of was wholly immaterial, and not calculated to prejudice the rights of appellants.
Appellees recovered judgment establishing their debt against Lambert for the full amount sued for, and fixing a lien upon the house and lot involved for the payment of the same. According to the uncontradicted testimony of appellee R. H. Russell, a portion of the account sued on, and for which the judgment establishes a lien against the property, was for painting a fence where Lambert then resided, which was upon another street, and no part of the premises involved. That mechanics’ and material men’s liens do not attach to other premises separate and distinct from those upon which the improvement or repairs are made, is a rule of law too well settled to require any citation of authorities to support it.
It follows, therefore, that appellees were not entitled to have a lien established against the property in controversy for the entire amount of the debt sued upon; and as Cameron & Co. have a lien on the same property, they can complain of this error, though Lambert, as he filed no motion for a new trial, can not.
As the record shows that Cameron & Co. are subrogated to whatever rights Harrison ever had in the property in question, we have not considered the case with reference to his rights, further than as they affect the rights of Cameron & Co.
In reference to the question of two judgments being rendered against Lambert for the same debt, if such be the case, which does not appear as a distinct fact found by the jury, as the former judgment does not fix a lien against the property involved in this case, no one but Lambert could complain; and as he failed to file a motion for a new trial, the application of correct rules of practice would, perhaps, preclude him also from complaint on that score.
However, in our opinion, a court ought not to render two independent judgments against a party for the same debt. If any part of the debt sued for in this action is embraced in the judgment in the other case, the amount thereof can be ascertained, and a judgment rendered that will supersede the former judgment and afford adequate protection to all parties. To obtain the requisite data for this purpose, it may become necessary to submit the case to the jury on special issues.
The judgment of the District Court will be reversed and cause remanded.

219191,R. A. Henson v. William Sackville,1893-02-08,"KEY, Associate Justice.
This is an action of trespass to try title. Appellant was plaintiff in the District Court. After showing title from the government down to Mrs. Maria Jesusa Lee to the land sued for, •plaintiff introduced in evidence a personal judgment in favor of James Denson and others against James B. Lee and Maria Jesusa Lee for $1500, rendered by the District Court of Bexar County, October 21,1858. This judgment did not direct the sale of Mrs. Lee’s separate property.
On this judgment an execution was issued in December, 1858, against J. B. and Maria Jesusa Lee, directed to the sheriff of Bexar County, and the land here involved was sold by said sheriff under this execution, on the first Tuesday in February, 1859, to appellant; and the sheriff executed to him a deed therefor March 5, 1859. At the time the judgment was rendered Mrs. Lee was a married woman, wife of J. B. Lee.
Frio and several other counties were created out of part of the territory of Bexar County by an act of the Legislature dated February 1, 1858, which took effect from its passage.
Medina County was organized in 1849, and terms of the District Courts-were regularly held up to and including 1858 and 1859; and during said last two years it was the nearest organized county to Frio. The land involved is in Frio County.
The court excluded the sheriff’s deed from the evidence, and appellant declining to take a nonsuit, judgment was rendered in favor of defendant.
Two objections urged against the sheriff’s deed under which appellant claims were sustained by the trial court. These were:
First. That as the judgment under which the sale was made did not by its terms direct the sale of Mrs. Lee’s separate property, she being at the time a married woman, the sale and deed were void.
Second. That under the act of the Legislature creating Frio County, it was attached to Medina County for judicial purposes; and that the land being in Frio County, the execution should have been issued to and sale-made by the sheriff of Medina County; and that the sale made by the sheriff of Bexar County was a nullity and passed no title.
1. While there are respectable authorities which hold, that unless authorized by and rendered in accordance with a statute, a judgment against a married woman is void and of no effect whatever, there are many others that declare such judgments to be only erroneous or voidable, and that until set aside, the separate property of the wife may be sold under process issued thereon. Black on Judg., secs. 188, 190, 191, and cases cited.
The reason generally given by courts holding such judgments to be absolutely void is, that by the common law, on account of the merger of the wife’s personality in that of the husband, she was incapacitated for almost every species of juristic action. Ib., sec. 188.
As is clearly shown by Chief Justice Hemphill in Jones v. Taylor, 7 Texas, 240, the reason for such a rule does not exist in this State; but previous to that decision, the question under consideration had been detennined in Howard v. North, 5 Texas, 290, wherein it was held, that a sale of the wife’s separate property under a personal judgment against her, as against a collateral attack, was valid and passed title. See, also, Taylor v. Harris, 21 Texas, 438.
The first objection to the deed should have been overruled.
2. In was held in O’Shea v. Twohig, 9 Texas, 336, that when a new county is created out of part of the territory of an existing organized county, the territory embraced in the new county remains part of the mother county, for all governmental purposes, until the new county is organized, or attached for such purposes to some other organized county. That case was approved and followed in Clark v. Goss, 12 Texas, 396, and Lumpkin v. Muncey, 66 Texas, 311.
Under the doctrine of these cases, the execution sale under which appellant claims was properly made in Bexar County, unless, for the purpose of such sales, by some statute then in force, Frio County, in which the land was situated, was at that time attached to some other organized county.
In support of the proposition that Frio County had been thus segregated, appellee invokes the twenty-ninth section of the act creating that and other counties, which was in force at the date of the judgment, execution, and sale under which appellant claims, and which reads as follows: “ That until attached by law to some judicial district or districts, each of said counties shall be attached for judicial purposes, in matters appertaining to the jurisdiction of the District Court, to the nearest county in which the District Court may be held.”
Under the facts disclosed by the record, for the purposes stated in this statute, Frio County was at the time in question attached to Medina County; and the question for determination is, whether or not the purposes for which it was so detached from Bexar and attached to Medina County include a sheriff’s sale of land in Frio County made under an execution issued upon a judgment of a District Court other than that of Medina County.
The solution of this question is not free from difficulty. If the statute read, for judicial purposes, without qualification, the case would fall within the doctrine announced in Folts v. Ferguson, 77 Texas, 301, and the ruling of the court below would be clearly correct. But such is not the case. It contains limitations, both express and implied, that take it out of the general rule declared in that case. We think the controlling purpose of the section referred to was to furnish the people of the newly created counties the most convenient courts in which to conduct their important litigation and perform the greater part of their jury service. In our view, this provision should be construed as though it read thus: “ That until by law attached to some judicial district or districts, each of said counties shall be attached to the nearest county in which District Courts may be held, for judicial purposes in all matters appertaining to the jurisdiction of said courts.”
The fact that the Legislature used the expression “ counties in which the District Court may be held ” supports the conclusion that the purpose was to limit the section transferring jurisdiction, not to matters pertaining to the jurisdiction of District Courts generally, but to such matters as appertained to the jurisdiction of the District Courts of the particular counties to which the new counties were attached.
As we adopt this construction, it becomes unnecessary for us to determine the extent of the power and authority that was conferred upon the District Courts to which it is limited. It did more, however, than prescribe venue for legal proceedings. It constituted Frio a part of Medina County as to all proceedings in the District Court of the latter. Whether or not this would include execution sales under judgments rendered by the District Court of Medina County need not be determined in this case.
But in all matters pertaining to or founded upon proceedings in other courts, whether Supreme, District, County, or Justice Courts, jurisdiction remained with Bexar, the parent county. It can not be disputed, that while this law was in force Bexar County was the proper and necessary place to sell real estate in Frio County, under an execution issued upon a judgment rendered by the Supreme Court or by a justice of the peace. Bexar County retained jurisdiction in all proceedings in probate matters, and over all suits and proceedings below District Court jurisdiction, including sales of real estate under execution. It remained the place to record deeds, to pay taxes; and when necessary to sell real estate for taxes, Bexar County was the proper place to make such sales. This being the case, is there any thing in the language of the statute warranting the conclusion, that when for so many governmental purposes jurisdiction was left with Bexar County, including all other judicial sales, it was intended that an execution sale under a judgment of a District Court must be made in Medina County ? With the possible exception of sales made under executions from the District Court of Medina County, we think not. At any rate, it is not clear that such was the legislative purpose, and if the statute is ambiguous, considerations of uniformity and harmony in the law suggest the propriety of holding that the mother county was the proper place for such sales.
' As illustrating the confusion which might result from the construction contended for by appellees, suppose two judgments had been rendered against the same defendant, one in the District Court of Travis County and the other in a Justice of the Peace Court of the same county. To have subjected land in Frio County belonging to the judgment debtor to the payment of these judgments, would it have been necessary to issue one execution to Bexar County and the other to Medina County ? According to appellee’s contention, it would.
A construction leading to such incongruities ought not to be adopted, unless the language of the statute precludes any more reasonable interpretation.
This statute, by its very terms, takes from the mother county only part of its jurisdiction for judicial purposes. It follows, therefore, that no construction can be placed upon it—unless it be restricted to fixing venue only—which will not be productive of some confusion; but we believe the one which we have adopted will more nearly harmonize it with other laws and effectuate the legislative purpose than would the adoption of the interpretation contended for by appellees.
We therefore conclude that the court below erred in sustaining the second objection to the sheriff’s deed.
Some other objections were urged against the deed, but they are not of such importance as to require extended discussion. In our opinion, they were correctly overruled.
The judgment of the District Court is reversed and cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered February 8, 1893."
216198,Anson Mills et al. v. George Paul et al.,1892-11-02,"KEY, Associate Justice.
The appellees in this case have filed a mo-
tion seeking to strike from the files and have this court refuse to consider the transcript filed by the appellants, upon the grounds:
1. That the record shows four separate and distinct judgments of four separate and distinct cases.
2. Because the caption does not refer to or name either one of the causes, the record of which is presented and transcript filed.
3. Because the certificate of the clerk only refers to three of the causes tried, and does not embrace the principal case disclosed by the record.
4. Because the clerk’s endorsement upon said transcript does not show for whom the transcript was applied and for whom it was delivered.
The appellants resist this motion, upon the grounds:
1. That the motion is too late, because the Supreme Court granted leave to file the transcript.
2. Because it is claimed that the appellees, in signing the waiver of time for filing tlie transcript, have waived their right to object to the transcript that is filed.
3. They claim that there is no merit in the motion, as the record shows that all of said causes have been consolidated.
The record shows that on the 23rd day of June, 1890, the District Court of El Paso County made an order consolidating nine several causes, and ordered that they be tried as one cause, to-wit, Charles E. Fruin v. George Paul et al., file No. 1319; Momsen and Thorn v. George Paul et al., file No. 1320; William Cameron & Co. v. George Paul et al., file No. 1322; O. T. Bassett v. Charles E. Fruin et al., file No. 1323; Burton, Lingo & Co. v. George Paul et al., file No. 1324; T. M. Cooney v. George Paul et al., file No. 1325; Davis and Rogers v. Anson Mills et al., file No. 1327; Berla & Co. v. Anson Mills et al., file No. 1340; George Paul v. Anson Mills et al., file No. 1326; and that all of said parties in said several suits file their pleadings in this cause under file No. 1319; and that all the rights of said secondary parties be adjusted in this said cause.
This order was made in cause No. 1319, Charles E. Fruin v. George Paul et al., and was made upon the application of the appellants in this cause, and embraces the four causes shown by the record to' have been tried in said court.
At the February term, 1892, four of the cases embraced in the foregoing order of consolidation, to-wit, William Cameron & Co. v. George Paul et al., file No. 1322; O. T. Bassett v. Charles E. Fruin et al., file No. 1323; T. M. Cooney & Co. v. George Paul et al., file No.-; George Paul et al. v. Anson Mills, J. F. Crosby, and Josephine Crosby, file No.-, were tried, and separate verdicts returned, and separate judgments entered in each of said causes. The trial (or trials) was had upon separate petitions of each set of plaintiffs, but on one answer, so prepared as to constitute an answer to each petition. The court gave separate charges applicable to each case.
Thereafter a motion for a new trial was filed in the cause of Charles E. Fruin v. George Paul et al., stating that the defendants, Anson Mills, J. E. Crosby, and Josephine Crosby, moved the court to set aside the verdicts and judgments rendered in the following causes consolidated and tried with this cause, viz., George Paul v. Anson Mills et al., No. 1326; O. T. Bassett v. Charles E. Fruin et al., No. 1323; William Cameron & Co. v. George Paul et al., No. 1322, and T. M. Cooney & Co. v. George Paul et al., No. 1325.
This motion being overruled, defendants gave notice of appeal.
The statement of facts was prepared and filed by the district judge in cause of Charles E. Fruin v. George Paul et al., No. 1319, and certain causes consolidated therewith.
The appellants’ assignment of errors is filed in the same cause, and assigns errors committed in the trial of the foregoing four cases, giving their styles and numbers, as consolidated and tried together.
The appellants filed four supersedeas and appeal bonds in cause No. 1319, of Charles E. Fruin v. George Paul et al., each reciting that, “ Whereas, in the above styled and numbered cause, and causes consolidated therewith, pending, in said District Court of El Paso county, Texas, the plaintiff [giving the name of the plaintiff] had recovered judgment against defendants in said cause,” etc.
The clerk’s certificate at the end of the transcript reads as follows:
“ State of Texas, County of El Paso. — I, J. A. Escajeda, clerk of the District Court in and for El Paso County, Texas, do hereby certify that the foregoing pages are a true and correct transcript of all papers, orders, decrees, and proceedings had in the District Court of El Paso County, Texas, in causes Nos. 1322, 1323, 1324, and 1326, wherein William Cameron & Co., plaintiffs, v. George Paul et al., defendants; O. T. Bassett, plaintiff, v. Charles E. Fruin et al., defendants; T. M. Cooney & Co., plaintiffs, v. George Paul et al., defendants, as the same, with other causes, were consolidated as one Cause, under No. 1319, where Charles E. Fruin, plaintiff, v. George Paul et al., defendants, together with a correct and true bill of costs herein.”
This certificate is properly signed and has the seal attached.
While the judgments themselves do not show it, it is admitted in appellees’ motion that the four cases were tried at the same time and -before the same jury; but inasmuch as the record shows separate charges, verdicts, and judgments, we believe that, for the purposes of an appeal, they must be treated as separate and distinct trials.
If this is not true, then, treating the order of consolidation as in force at the time of the trials, it appears that there is no final judgment in the case; because the judgments rendered in the court below do not dispose of the other five cases, and the rights of the parties therein, with which these four were consolidated. Martin v. Crow, 28 Texas, 614; Simpson v. Bennett, 42 Texas, 241; Linn v. Arambould, 55 Texas, 611; Mignon v. Brinson, 74 Texas, 18.
However our attention may be called to the fact, if the record discloses that no final judgment has been rendered in a cause, then this court is compelled to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction; and sustaining the motion before us has the same effect.
If it be true that the order of consolidation was in force at the time of the trial, and the other parties to the consolidated suit had not withdrawn or been dismissed from the case or otherwise disposed of, then the proceedings of the court below — from which this appeal is sought to be prosecuted — did not constitute a final judgment; and while without acquiring jurisdiction of the case we have no authority to direct how the District Court should proceed, yet if it be a fact that there has been no final judgment rendered, then in law the consolidated case should be proceeded with and tried in the District Court as though there had never been any trial therein.
Delivered November 2, 1892.
It follows, therefore, that the first ground of the motion is well taken; and inasmuch as the certificate of the clerk undertakes to enumerate the several causes tried, and omits the case of George Paul v. Anson Mills, Josiah F. Crosby, and Josephine Crosby, except by giving its file number, it must also be held that the third ground of the motion is well taken. Sup. Ct. Rules 90, 96.
We do not think that appellees are precluded from making this motion by their action as stated in the appellants’ answer to the motion. All that they did was to sign a' paper admitting that the facts stated in the appellants' motion to be allowed to file transcript after the time required by law, excusing themselves for not filing the same, were true, and consenting that appellants might file a transcript and their briefs at a later day than that permitted by the rules. They did not consent to the filing of any particular transcript.
-Nor did the Supreme Court, in granting appellants permission to file transcript at a later day than required by law, give permission to file this particular transcript.
For the reasons above stated, the motion to strike out the transcript filed by appellants on the 25th day of June, 1892, will be granted, and the appeal herein dismissed.
Dismissed."
219193,Frank Lerch and Otto Lerch v. D. H. and J. W. Snyder,1893-02-08,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
On the 13th day of January, 1887, J. H. Hill executed a deed of trust upon certain real and personal property, to secure certain notes due by him to the San Angelo National Bank. At the maturity of the indebtedness, the property was advertised and about to be sold, and to prevent this Hill applied to J. H. Glass, of San Antonio, Texas, for relief, and agreed to pay him a.commission of $150 for his services in connection with securing him the loan, and further agreed that this additional sum due as commissions should be secured as the other indebtedness, and paid out of the proceeds of the sale under the deed of trust. The notes were transferred to Glass, and extended for Hill’s accommodation. Subsequently a substituted trustee, Hill again defaulting in payment, advertised the property under the deed of trust, and sold it. The cash was paid for the personal property, but P. J. Willis, who bought the real estate, failed to pay for it at the time. This sale occurred September 27, 1887. Thereafter, this real estate was again advertised to be sold on the 18th day of October, 1887, but before the sale Willis paid the purchase money for a part of the land bought by him at the first sale, and the remainder, which is the land in controversy, was again sold and purchased by Frank Lerch, one of the defendants.
In the original petition filed by J. H. Hill November 11, 1887, he made P. J. Willis and Frank Lerch defendants, and sought to set aside the two sales referred to above; and for grounds of vacating the first, of date September 27, alleged, that he was unable to attend on account of sickness, but before it was made he caused a tender to be made of all moneys due, including the costs, and that the property was not advertised a sufficient length of time under the deed of trust, and for these reasons the sale was void.
The second sale, of date October 18, was also attacked, on the grounds that it was not sufficiently advertised, and because, as alleged, the proceeds of the first sale had satisfied all demands against the property.
Thus the case stood, with J. H. Hill as plaintiff and the said P. J. Willis and Frank Lerch as defendants, until November 16, 1888, when D. H. and J. W. Snyder filed what is styled their petition of intervention, in which they make no complaint againt P. J. Willis, but sue Frank Lerch, and join therein Otto Lerch as a defendant. In this plea of intervention the original sale, of date September 27, is treated and considered as valid and regular in all respects, but they attacked the second sale as void ab initia upon two grounds: (1) That the sale was not advertised the requisite length of time under the deed of trust. (2) The first sale satisfied the debt secured by the deed of trust and the cost and expenses.
These intervenors set out as the basis of their right to intervene, that the original plaintiff, J. H. Hill, had executed a certain instrument to one of them, John W. Snyder, whereby these lands, with others, were conveyed to said Snyder to secure said intervenors in certain indebtedness due them by said Hill, and to indemnify them for certain liabilities incurred by them for said Hill. Said instrument is set out in full as an exhibit to said petition of intervenors.
The defendants Frank and Otto Lerch interposed their demurrers, general and special, to the original petition of Hill and the petition of intervention of D. H. and J. W. Snyder, which were overruled and exceptions taken; and also pleaded that the original sale of September 27 was properly advertised, and did not satisfy the deed of trust, expenses, costs, etc., and the second sale was in all respects regular and valid, and passed the title. Also, that the defendants were innocent purchasers of the land for a valuable consideration, without notice of any irregularities and defects, if there were any, etc.
On the day of trial the Park Land and Cattle Company intervened and claimed the land, adopting the pleadings of the Snyders. The motion to strike out this plea was overruled, and at the instance of the intervenors the case was dismissed as to the original plaintiff, Hill, and on the trial of the cause before the court without a jury, judgment was rendered in favor of the intervenors'Snyder and the Park Land and Cattle Company, jointly, against the defendants Frank and Otto Lercli, cancelling their deeds and giving judgment against them for the land and costs.
1. All the parties to the suit deraigned title from J. H. Hill as common source.
2. The appellees, D. H. and J. W. Snyder and the Park Land and Cattle Company, hold under a certain instrument executed by J. H. Hill,, which is as follows:
“The State of Texas, County of Tom Green.—Know all men by these presents, that I, J. H. Hill, for and in consideration of the sum of $10, cash in hand to me paid by John W. Snyder, of Williamson County, Texas, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, have granted, bargained,, sold, and conveyed, and by these presents do grant, bargain, sell, and convey unto him, the said John W. Snyder, the following tracts or parcels of land, to-wit. [Description of land omitted.]
“ To have and to hold, unto him, the said John W. Snyder, his heirs and assigns forever, in trust nevertheless, for the following purposes, to-wit:
“First. Whereas, D. H. and J. W. Snyder, of Georgetown, Texas, are my sureties on a certain note given by me to Mrs. E. H. Mitchell, of' Travis County, during the month of February, 1886, on, to-wit, the 22d of said month, the same being for a large amount of money, to-wit, the sum of $10,268; and whereas, the said D. H. and J. W. Snyder have-already advanced and paid for my benefit on said note the sum of $5000, and are held and firmly bound for the payment of the balance thereof, the said note referred to being the last note given by me to said Mrs. Mitchell, with said parties as sureties; now therefore, this conveyance made to indemnify and secure the said D. H. and J. W. Snyder against loss as far as may be done. And the said J. W. Snyder, as trustee hereunder, is fully authorized. to take possession of and control of the said lands; to sell the same at public or private sale for cash or on time, or for part cash and part on time, for such sums and in such manner as he may see fit; to do any and everything with regard thereto as if his own individual property; to make good and warranty deeds thereto,.save as-against the purchase money notes now outstanding against the same.
“ The proceeds of which sale or sales are to be applied as follows, to-wit: If said sales shall be made by the purchaser or purchasers assuming the amounts due on the purchase money notes due on said portions and giving an advance or additional sum for said land, then the advance shall be applied to the reasonable cost and expense of administering this trust, and the balance to repayment of said D. H. and J. W. Snyder the money already advanced by them for me; and if that shall have been fully refunded, then to the discharge of the remainder due on said note to Mrs. E. H. Mitchell. It being fully understood and agreed, that if it shall be deemed best by said John W. Snyder so to do, he shall have the right to sell a portion of said land and apply the proceeds to clearing the balance from all vendor’s liens and encumbrances now existing thereon, and so to use and convey the portion thus cleared so as to best answer and subserve the purposes of this trust deed, which is the indemnifying and securing the said D. H. and J. W. Snyder.
“ The surplus of the proceeds of said land, if any, after fully indemnifying said parties against loss and paying reasonable expenses of this trust, are to be paid over to me or my representatives.
“ In testimony whereof, I hereunto sign my name, this the 4th day of October, 1887.
[Signed] "" “ J. H. Hill.”
8. The appellee the Park Land and Cattle Company holds under a deed executed by the Snyders by virtue of this instrument.
4. The appellants hold under a sale made by virtue of a deed of trust executed by J. H. Hill for the benefit of J. H. Glass, the purchase made on the 18th day of October, 1887.
5. The deed of trust under which appellants hold required the property to be sold after giving ten days notice of the time, place, and terms, and description of the property to be sold, by printed advertisements in some newspaper published in Tom Green County, once a week for at least two successive weeks prior to the day of sale.
6. The land was sold to appellants on the 18th of October, 1887, under this deed of trust.
7. The notice of the sale required to be given was first published in the San Angelo Standard, a weekly newspaper published in San Angelo, Tom Green County, on October 8, 1887.
8. The sale was made as above stated, less than ten days after the advertisement was first published. For this reason, we find as a fact that the sale was void, and conferred no title upon appellants.
Several assignments of errors are presented by appellants, but we only notice those that we deem important.
It is contended by appellants, that the instrument under which the appellees assert title, as executed by J. H. Hill to D. H. and J. W. Snyder, is simply a deed of trust or mortgage, with power of sale, and does not confer upon the Snyders such interest in the land as would permit them to maintain this action. We think the deed of trust is broad enough in its terms to confer upon the Snyders the authority to make the transfer of the property to the intervenor the Park Land and Cattle Company, and in permitting them to remove cloud from the title and to cancel sales affecting the title, as could have been done by Hill himself, if he had insisted upon his rights in this case. The instrument authorizes the Snyders to take full possession and control of the lands; to sell the same at public or private sale, for cash or on time, and for such sums and in such manner as they may see fit; to do any and everything with regard thereto as if his own individual property; to make good and warranty deeds thereto. In accomplishing these purposes, Snyder had the right, in order to put him in a position to do the very acts and to perform the powers conferred upon him by the instrument, to have cancelled and set aside any adverse title that may have been a hindrance in the performance of these duties.
The second question presented by appellants is, that it does not appear from the pleadings or from the evidence that a tender was made by the appellees of the amount of purchase money paid by appellants at the trustee’s sale under which they hold. Reimbursing the appellants was not a duty required of the appellees as a predicate to maintaining this action and in obtaining the relief granted by the trial court. The sale made by the trustee was absolutely void. The Snyders had no interest in that matter, excepting so far as that sale may have been a cloud upon their title. Their interest was adverse to that of appellants, or that of any one else which tended to affect the title asserted by the Snyders. No obligation was resting upon the Snyders’, as a prerequisite to the right of attacking this adverse title, that they should discharge any claim that the appellants might have against J. H. Hill or Glass, to recover from them the price that the)r had paid for property of which they received no title.
The third question presented is, was the sale to appellants under the deed of trust under which they claim void ? The deed of trust required the land to be sold after advertisement of ten days in some newspaper published in Tom Green County. The evidence shows, that the first publication was made on the 8th of October, 1887, and the sale was made on the 18th of October, 1887. It is apparent from this statement that the sale was not advertised for the length of time required b)1- the terms of the deed of trust. The requirement of the law on the question of time, as shown by the facts of this case, is ten full days. The sale made upon the 18th would not be ten full days, because the day upon which the advertisement is first published is to be excluded in computing the time when the publication begins. The court below held the sale void for this reason, and also for the further reason that the debts secured by the deed of trust under which appellants claim had previously been paid and satisfied. Holding as we do, that the sale was void because not advertised for the length of time required by the deed of trust, it is not necessary for us to pass upon the other reason given the court below for holding the sale void.
The judgment of the court below is affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered February 8, 1893."
216274,Trinidad Guerra et al. v. City of San Antonio,1892-11-01,"COLLARD, Associate Justcie.
This is an action of trespass to try title, brought by Jesus Guerra, Trinidad Guerra, and others, as the only heirs of Dolores Hernandez, deceased, against Adolph Scholz, who, holding under a contract of lease from the city of San Antonio, caused it to be made a party defendant. Plaintiffs agreeing to adopt the contract of the city with him in case they should recover the property, he made no further defense. The original petition was filed August 31, 1885.
The city answered not guilty, limitation, stale demand, and title by prescription under thirty years possession, and asked for compensation for improvements made in good faith.
A jury was waived, and the court, after trying the cause, gave judgment for defendants, from which plaintiffs have appealed.
Plaintiffs read in evidence an instrument in writing, of date the 15th of February, 1842, upon which their claim to the property is based, as the heirs of Dolores Hernandez. Said instrument is in the Spanish language, and as translated into the English language, reads as follows:
“Republic of Texas, County of Bexar. — In the city of San Antonio, on the 15th day of the month of February of the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-two, before me, Juan Nepomaceno Seguin, president of the corporation of said city, personally appeared Dolores Hernandez, of this vicinity, who, I certify, is known to me, declared that by virtue of the destruction of the title of acquisition of the lot which she inherited from her deceased mother, in the confusion of the archives of this city in the capture of this place by the army of Texas, she presents as witnesses that they might declare under oath if they know whether her mother had a deed from the government of the ancient Province of Texas, and if they know whether any person had ever instituted suit against them to nullify the quiet, ancient, and legal possession which her predecessors held down to the interested lady of said land; and after having sworn the witnesses, Dn. Ignacio Tejada and Dn. Jose de la Garza, of this vicinity, according to the forms provided by law, they declared, that for many years they had known Dn. Martina Rios, living on the lot hereafter mentioned, that they have seen the title of possession in favor of said lady, extended by the Governor of the Province, Dn. Antonio Cordero, and that they have never seen or heard of any person instituting suit for the nullification of the quiet possession of the aforesaid land, which has been held by said lady down to the interested lady. And having proven that the part of the lot which belongs to Dn. Maria Dolores Hernandez has a front of twenty-one varas and depth to the river, bounded on the north by a lot of Dn. Candalaria Mansolo, on the west by the river of this city, on the south by lot of Dn. Juana Leal de Tarin, and on the east by the principal street running towards the muralla [rampart wall], and by virtue of the destruction of the original, in the epoch of which the interested lady has furnished a description, I extend the present that it may serve her as a protection in the meantime. I extend it to her in the same manner as to all Other persons who find themselves in the same condition as the present case, according to the disposition made by the corporation of this city on the second day of the current month.
“ City of San Antonio, February 15th, 1842.
“Juan N. Seguin, President of the Corporation.
his
“Jose de la X Garza.” mark.
We also find that Hernandez, mentioned in the foregoing paper, died many years before the filing of this suit, and that plaintiffs are her only heirs.
The land described in the foregoing instrument embraces the land described in plaintiffs’ petition.
On the 21st day of January, 1875, the plaintiffs herein executed a deed to Ed. Steves to certain land in the city of San Antonio, described therein, in which the following statement is made:
“ The present sale includes all houses, outhouses, other buildings, fences, and improvements actually existing on the premises, that have been inherited by the vendors from their deceased parents, Trinidad Guerra and Dolores Hernandez, who had inherited part of the same, and purchased the balance, as it appears from the different deeds of transfer, namely, from a deed delivered on the 15th of February, 1842, by the mayor of the city of San Antonio, said deed duly recorded in the county clerk’s office of Bexar County, in book S, No. 2, pages 279 and 280; from another deed of the 7tli day of May, 1858, delivered by Simon Ariola, through his attorney in fact.”
The land conveyed by this deed is not in controversy.
The defendants read in evidence other deeds, which we think are not important to our decision.
In addition to the foregoing, it was agreed, and we find, that the lot in question was unenclosed up to the time that defendant Scholz took possession thereof; and that there was a spring south of, or at the south end of, said lot near the water’s edge, to which the public had access for many years before they were cut off from the use of same by the wall built by defendant Scholz, under his. contract with defendant the city of San Antonio. That the property now sued for was a steep bluff, running from the edge of the street to near the water’s edge, which, up to the entry by defendant Scholz, under his contract with the city of San Antonio, had never been used by any person except the public for going down to a spring of water near the water’s edge. That about 1873 the city, to prevent the street from caving toward the river, built a heavy stone wall between the street and water, leaving a small space between the wall and water and an entrance way to the spring, and thereafter the water in the river receded, leaving the space, together with the stone wall, sufficient for defendant Scholz’s buildings. The said wall built by the city being used as Scholz’s east wall.
The appellants claim that the court erred in rendering judgment against the plaintiffs, because the city of San Antonio had acknowledged and confirmed the title of the plaintiffs to said property by the paper introduced in evidence, dated the 15tli day of February, 1842, signed by Juan N. Seguin, president of the corporation.
This is the principal question to be considered. Plaintiffs rested their title and right to recover upon this instrument, having proved that they were the heirs of Dolores Hernandez.
It is well settled in this State that the acts of an officer assuming to discharge an attribute of office are presumed to be within the scope of his authority, unless the contrary be shown. Jones v. Garza, 11 Texas, 205; Hancock v. McKinney, 7 Texas, 384; Jenkins v. Chambers, 9 Texas, 167; Wooters v. Hall, 61 Texas, 15.
It may be conceded for appellants that the paper executed by Seguin, president of the corporation of the city of San Antonio, was executed by proper authority for whatever it may be worth, as there is nothing in the record to show that he had no such authority.
We know of no law, and are cited to none, which grants to the mayor or president of any incorporated city or town the official function exercised by Seguin in the execution of the foregoing instrument. He may have had such power, however, by vote of the corporation, by ordinance, or by direction of the duly constituted city authorities. ,
The instrument discloses that it is extended to the interested party “in the same manner as to all other persons who find themselves in the same condition as the present case, according to the disposition made by the corporation of this city on the second day of the current month” — February, 1842; indicating that the power was granted by the corporation to perform the act as it was done.
But the question is, What did this instrument mean ? To what did it entitle the interested party ?
It does not disclose its object. It allowed her to make proof of the loss of her original grant by persons who had seen it, and after this proof was made, the paper was extended that it may “serve her as a protection in the meantime,” as to all other persons in the same condition.
What protection was this ? How long did it last ? And was it to be followed by suit, or any other prescribed mode of establishing title ?
To answer this, we must know what the corporation had done for such cases, what relief it granted, and on what conditions.
The paper itself does not show it; it was not a deed, a relinquishment, or a grant of title. The most that its terms imply is that it was a temporary protection, but the character of protection is not stated. The common law was in force at the time, by statute of January 20, 1840, which would not construe the instrument into a conveyance, or an absolute and final recognition of title. What the intention and office of the instrument was could only be ascertained by the proceedings authorizing it, by the power conferred upon the officer taking the proof.
It may have been a protection of possession until suit could be brought in the courts to establish title in the regular way; it may have been a protection in the use of houses and improvements for a'time; it may have been something else. It is useless to speculate about it.
If it was intended as a guaranty of possession only of houses and improvements, these had been sold to Steves. The land in suit had never been enclosed or reduced to actual possession by plaintiffs. It must be presumed, in the absence of proof, that Hernandez and her heirs have already enjoyed to the fullest extent and exhausted the privileges granted them by the protection.
At all events, we can not saj^ that the instrument was of such a character as would authorize a recovery in trespass to try title against any one — even the party granting it — since no claim thereunder has been asserted for many years. It purports to be only a temporary protection. Its language must be interpreted under the light of the common law, and only such meaning given to it as it actually signifies. If we had the acts of the corporation upon which the president acted, we might arrive at the intent and meaning of the instrument; without that we can not.

Having failed to show title, plaintiffs could not recover. No other judgment could have been rendered by the court below, and it is affirmed.

216189,Robert Tate et al. v. Oscar Kramer et al.,1892-11-02,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
The statement of the nature and result of the suit made by plaintiffs in error is correct, and is accepted by the defendants in error. It is as follows:
“ This suit, in form an action of trespass to try title to about 1700 acres of land in G-illespie county, Texas, was brought in the District Court of said county February 10, 1887, by plaintiffs in error against Kramer and Hardt, defendants in error. February 24, 1887, defendants answered by general demurrer, general denial, and plea of not guilty. September 23, 1887, the court granted leave to defendants to make their warrantor, J. I. Neely, party defendant. February 21, 1888, said Neely appeared and filed an answer, making himself party defendant, and setting up, in substance, that at the time he sold the land in controversy to his codefendants Kramer and Hardt, to-wit, on June 19, 1886, he was possessed of the legal title to it, which he had acquired without any notice of the claim or rights of plaintiffs, and for a valuable consideration; that he sold said lands to defendants Kramer and Hardt for a valuable consideration, and that at no time prior to the filing of this suit did he or they have any notice of the claims or rights of plaintiffs, etc. February 27, 1888, plaintiffs filed their supplemental petition, in which they denied the allegations made by Neely, and averred that he sold said land to his codefendants on a credit, and had not received payment of the price or purchase money therefor, to-wit, the sum of $3800, agreed upon by the defendants; that said sum of $3800 is still due to said defendant (Neely) from his codefendants for said land; that defendants, at the time of their purchase, had notice that said land was held in trust by Mary A. Tate for plaintiffs, who were the owners thereof, and they prayed as in their original petition; ‘and further, in case they may not be entitled to recover said land, then that that they have judgment against said defendants for the unpaid purchase money, and interest thereon; also that they have such other and further relief as their case may require.’ On the 28th of February, 1888, the case was tried by the court, a jury being waived, and judgment was rendered that plaintiffs take nothing of defendants, etc. This judgment was duly excepted to, and notice of appeal given by plaintiffs, and ten days were allowed within which, after adjournment, to make and file statement of facts. Findings of facts and conclusions of law were filed by the court, and a statement of facts was approved and filed on the 8th of March, 1888.”
The plaintiffs have brought the case into this court for revision by writ of error, and assigned errors as follows:
The second assignment of error: “ The court erred in the conclusions of law and fact found, and especially:
“1. In finding as a fact (section 5) that Mrs. M. A. Tate conveyed to J. I. Neely the land in controversy, when all the evidence relating thereto, given by said Tate and defendant Neely, with Neely’s letters, and conclusions of the court in section 10, show that both said parties fully intended and understood the deed to be only a quitclaim of whatever right she might have to the land, and not a conveyance of the land, said land being worth, as shown, $3600, and the price paid by said J. I. Neely to Mrs. M. A. Tate being only $100.
“2. In finding as facts (section 6, et seq.) that defendant Neely conveyed to the other defendants by warranty deeds the land sued for, and thereby vested in said codefendants the legal title to said land, when, as the evidence shows, said Neely only made a conditional contract to sell the land to his codefendants, and that codefendants had paid only a small fraction of the agreed purchase price for the land, and were wholly in default as to the entire balance, thereby renouncing claim or title to the land.
“ 3. In finding as law (sections 2 and 3, conclusions of law) that the deed from Mrs. M. A. Tate to defendant J. I. Neely vested in said Neely the title to the entire tract of land sued for, ‘ and the defendants Kramer and Hardt could not be affected by understandings, etc., between said Tate and Neely,’ since it was shown by all the evidence relating thereto, viz., the evidence of said Neely and Tate, and the contracts of sale by said Neely to his codefendants, that defendant Neely bought only such claim as Mrs. M. A. Tate might have, paid only $100 therefor, when the market value of the land was $3660 at least, and that defendants Kramer and Hardt had paid only $530 of said market value, made default as to the balance, and forfeited or relinquished all claim to the land.”
The third assignment of error: “ The judgment rendered in this cause is erroneous, contrary to the law and the evidence adduced, in that it is for the defendants when it should have been for the plaintiffs for at least seven-eighths of its value, as prayed for in plaintiffs’ first supplemental petition, as is shown by all the evidence adduced on the trial, and especially by the evidence and conclusions of fact hereinbefore specified.”
The court’s findings of facts and conclusions of law are as follows:
Findings of Facts. — “ 1. In 1873 plaintiffs and their mother, Mrs. M. A. Tate, were the heirs of Waddy Tate, Jr., and each entitled to an equal share of his estate.
“2. In a suit had between plaintiffs herein and Mrs. M. A. Tate as heirs of Waddy Tate, Jr., who was one of the heirs of Waddy Tate, Sr., and the other heirs of said Waddy Tate, Sr., J. C. Brown was appointed receiver, and ordered to sell the property belonging to the estate of Waddy Tate, Sr., for partition.
“3. At this sale, had in 1874, the premises in controversy were bid in by the attorney of M. A. Tate and her children, the plaintiffs herein, and the purchase money for same charged against their joint interest in the estate of Waddy Tate, Sr.
“4. By direction of the attorney for plaintiffs and Mrs. M. A. Tate, a deed for this premises was executed by said receiver, J. C. Brown, to Mrs. M. A. Tate alone, which deed was recorded in Gillespie County, December 22, 1875.
“5. On November 26, 1884, Mrs. M. A. Tate conveyed the premises conveyed to her by said Brown to defendant J. I. Neely, by deed with special warranty of persons claiming by, through, or under her, which deed was recorded in Gillespie County on April 25, 1885.
“6. On June 19,1886, defendant J. I. Neely conveyed by general warranty deeds, retaining, however, vendor’s lien, to defendant Oscar Kramer 640 acres of the premises conveyed to him by Mrs. M. A. Tate, and to Herman Hardt the balance of said premises.
“ 7. On February 10, 1887, plaintiffs filed this suit.
“8. In 1878 the land was sold for taxes, and taxes have ever since been paid by purchaser at tax sale, and after he conveyed his claim to defendant Neely taxes were paid by said Neely.
“ 9. Defendant J. I. Neely paid to Mrs. M. A. Tate the consideration expressed in her deed to him, and had at the time no actual notice of any claim on part of plaintiffs.
“ 10. Mrs. M. A. Tate intended the conveyance to J. I. Neely as a quitclaim, and defendant J. I. Neely agreed to receive a quitclaim.
“11. Defendants Kramer and Hardt paid to Neely so much of the purchase money as shown by their deeds, and executed negotiable notes for remainder as shown by said deeds.”
Conclusions of Law. — “ 1. Mrs. M. A. Tate was invested by the deed from J. C. Brown to herself with the legal title to the land, unvalued, in this litigation, holding same, however, as an undivided seven-eighths of same in trust for plaintiffs herein, who were the equitable owners of said seven-eighths interest.
“2. The defendants Oscar Kramer and Herman Hardt having purchased said land from J. I. Neely for a valuable consideration, without notice, actual or constructive, of plaintiffs’ equitable claim to same, and acquired from said Neely the legal title to same, are entitled to judgment quieting their title and possession of same.
“ 3. The conveyance by Mrs. M. A. Tate to J. I. Neely being on its face a deed to the land and not a quitclaim to grantor’s interest therein, it passed the legal title vested in M. A. Tate to same; and defendants Kramer and Hardt could not be affected by any private understanding between Mrs. M. A. Tate and J. I. Neely as to the effect of said conveyance, it not being shown that they had any notice, actual or constructive, thereof.
“ 4. Plaintiffs not being entitled to recover as against defendants Kramer and Hardt, judgment will be rendered that plaintiffs take nothing by their suit and that defendants recover their costs.”
The findings of fact require some explanation, qualifications, and additions, as shown by the evidence.
The receiver, J. C. Brown, bought the land at the sale made by him for $87, for Mrs. Tate and her children, and the amount, so reported to the court by the receiver, was ordered, according to the rights of the parties, to be paid to Mrs. Tate and children in equal amounts. The money was never paid. The intention was that Mrs. Tate and her children should own the land equally and jointly. No money was paid Mrs. Tate for the land or to the parties by the receiver, as entitled, but the deed by the receiver was made to Mrs. Tate, the children having by resulting trust seven-eighths of the land, and she one-eighth.
Tate bought in a tax title to the land from one Schuchard for $275; the record discloses nothing of the regularity of the tax title but a tax deed by the sheriff of Gillespie County to Schuchard, and a deed from him to Neely, to the admission of which plaintiffs objected, because they did not show a legal assessment of the land for taxes, nor other precedent requisites authorizing the tax sale. (The clerk states that these deeds were missing since the filing of the petition for writ of error, and could not be found in his office.)
The sale by Schuchard of his tax title was made over two years from the date of his purchase at the sale.
Neely’s purchase from Mrs. Tate was on the 26th day of November, 1884, she at the time living in Yazoo County, Mississippi; he paid her $100 for the entire 1700 acres; he sold the land to Kramer and Hardt, defendants, on the 19th of June, 1886, for $3660 — $536 in cash and $3124 on time, secured by their negotiable promissory notes, the deeds reciting the facts, and retaining a vendor’s lien upon the land sold to each to secure the unpaid balance.
This suit was filed February 10, 1887, and at that time, and at the time of the trial, Kramer and Hardt still owed Neely the amount of the notes.
It was understood between Mrs. Tate and Neely at the time of her deed to him, that she was to make him a quitclaim deed for her claim to the land, but he had no blank form for quitclaim deed, and used a form of general warranty, inserting after the warranty clause, “ by, through, or under me only,” believing that this language made the deed a quitclaim, as he told Mrs. Tate. The deed purports to convey the land. There was some correspondence between them about the purchase, and two of liis letters to her were in evidence, but the clerk states, in a note, that they are missing and could not be copied. He sent the deed to her to sign.
His agreement with her was to buy her claim and take a quitclaim, and he believed he had done so. He knew of no title in the children, or other title, except the tax title which lie owned.
The facts leave no doubt that Neel)r contracted for and intended to contract for a quitclaim deed from Mrs. Tate — a quitclaim in its strict legal sense; that is, for her claim onl}-. His deed is in form of a conveyance of the land, it is true, and upon its face is not a quitclaim, but he is not in an attitude to insist upon the form of his deed. He claims to be an innocent purchaser, and contends that he is so becausé his deed purports to convey him the land, and not a mere chance of title: He insists upon the letter of the law in construing the deed, while it is shown by his own testimony that it misrepresents the facts and is false. His letters to Mrs. Tate evidently contained the agreement that he was to have a quitclaim, as he swears he told her he was to buy her title only, he being in Texas and she in Mississippi. It would work a fraud upon her children to refuse to give effect to the agreement.
A quitclaim vendee can not be an innocent purchaser, because it serves him with notice that he is only purchasing the chance of title — such title as the vendor has, and no more. Such notice, or any notice of the fact that there is a better title, excludes good faith from the transaction. To be an innocent purchaser the vendee must in good faith pay á valuable consideration, without notice of outstanding legal or equitable rights.
His agreement to take a strict quitclaim has the effect to give him notice. 1-Iis deed should be construed upon this question by all the facts attending the transaction — his letters, his actual information, his agreement for a quitclaim, the gross' inadequacy of consideration, and any other circumstance tending to show notice and the absence of good faith.
He testifies, that he was to have only Mrs. Tate’s title, that he thought or believed the deed was a quitclaim, and that the special warranty made it so.
Under such circumstances he should not be allowed to take advantage of the form of the deed to establish good faith. He was himself responsible for the mistake in the deed; he knew what a quitclaim implied— title of the vendor only; he was in the position of one who had all the notice a quitclaim could give, with a full understanding of what such title meant — notice, and want of good faith.
He asks to be protected upon equitable principles. These principles do not apply in his case. He is not what he claims to be — an innocent purchaser. He should not by force of legal rules of construction (of his deed) be allowed equitable protection when the undisputed facts show that he is not within the equity rule invoked.
Delivered November 2, 1892.
We are of opinion that he had full notice of the character of title he was receiving, qualified and controlled as it was by the attending circumstances. Under such title he could not be a purchaser in good faith. Harrison v. Boring, 44 Texas, 262; Taylor v. Harrison, 47 Texas, 461; Milam County v. Bateman, 54 Texas, 155; Richardson v. Levi, 67 Texas, 359; 2 Pome. Eq. Jur., sec. 753.
Finding that Neely is in the same attitude of a vendee in a quitclaim, he is required to take notice of all other claims to the land. He can not say he knew of one, the tax title bought in by himself, and therefore did not know of the equitable title in the plaintiffs. His position is that of one having notice of all titles. The question is not one of being merely put upon inquiry; the notice is absolute and conclusive as to all claims.
It was in proof that the greater part of the purchase price of the land had not been paid to Neely by Kramer and Hardt, to whom he had contracted a sale of the land for $3660. It seems the notes are negotiable promissory notes, but at the time of trial they were still owned and held by Neely. They are not irrevocably bound to pay him these notes, and if they should do so after notice of plaintiffs’ rights, they would not be acquitted of their obligation to pay the true owners at least the amount unpaid at the time of notice. To this extent they would not be innocent purchasers.
Plaintiffs’ pleadings prayed for relief appropriate to the case, judgment against them (Kramer and Hardt) for the unpaid purchase money, but the court below refused it. 2 Pome. Eq. Jur., secs. 754, 755, 756; 1 Story Eq. Jur., sec. 64; Perry on Trusts, secs. 219, 221; Caldwell v. Fraim, 32 Texas, 310; Evans v. Templeton, 69 Texas, 375.
The judgment of the lower court should be reversed and remanded, and it is so ordered.
jReversed and remanded."
219135,Western Union Telegraph Company v. G. M. Shumate,1893-02-08,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
Suit by Shumate, the appellee, against the appellant, for damages for failure to transmit and deliver the following telegram:
“ G-atesville, November 30, 1887.
“Mr. G. F. Johnson, Oceanside, Gal.:
“ Close the trade. I will come soon.
“ G-. M. Shumate.”
Plaintiff paid the full charge for the message through to Oceanside.
The line of the Western Union extended to San Bernardino, California, and no further in the direction of Oceanside. From San Bernardino the company relied upon the California Southern Eailway Company for transmission of messages to Oceanside, over its private lines. The message in question, was sent to San Bernardino by defendant, and was delivered to the California Southern Eailway Company to be forwarded to Oceanside. It was not delivered to Johnson at Oceanside, and the trade was not closed, as directed by Shumate.
Shumate resided in Coryell County, Texas, and in November, 1887, he received a letter from G-. F. Johnson, at Oceanside, with a request to join him in a lease and purchase of land near Oceanside, and the telegram to Johnson was a reply to the letter. Shumate testified, that at the time he delivered the message to defendant’s agent at G-atesville, he (Shumate) told him that unless it went through all right, it would crush him or break him up, and Tillman, the agent, assured him it would go through all right.
Plaintiff moved with his family from G-atesville to Oceanside, going by rail, but when he arrived at Oceanside he learned that the trade had not been made because his message had not been-delivered, and the owner of the property had made other arrangements. Shumate then returned with his family to Gatesville, Texas.
Plaintiff in his petition claimed damages for loss occasioned by the failure to make the trade; loss by selling off some of his effects in Texas at a sacrifice, preparatory to leaving; expenses in going to and returning with his family from Oceanside.
The court below sustained defendant’s exceptions to the item of damage for loss from failure to close the trade of lease and purchase of property at Oceanside, and overruled exceptions to alleged damages by sacrifice by sale of effects in Texas, and expenses going to California and returning. The trial before the court resulted in a judgment for plaintiff for §375, from which defendant has appealed.
The first error assigned is the action of the court in overruling the exception to the item of damage alleged by sale of property at a sacrifice. Evidence was offered sustaining the item, and it evidently entered into the amount of damages for which judgment was rendered.
This assignment of error is well taken. The damages claimed are too remote, and could not have entered into the contemplation of the parties at the time the telegram was received. Plaintiff was not bound to sell his property, and defendant would not be responsible for the price it brought.
The second assignment is to the effect, that the court should have sustained the exception to the claim in the petition of compensation for expenses incurred by plaintiff in going to and from California with his family.
In our opinion, the relation of these expenses to a breach of the obliligation on the part of the defendant is such as to constitute them legitimate damages. They proceed directly from the breach, and are the natural consequences flowing from it. To avail himself of the lease and acquisition of the property in California, plaintiff had to move with Ms family to Oceanside; his moving there with his family was a necessary incident of the trade referred to in the dispatch, a consequence for which defendant would be liable upon failure to transmit and deliver the message. 3 Suth. on Dam., 298, et seq.
But appellant insists, that by the terms of the contract it was exempt from damages except for failure of performance on its own line, and that as the evidence shows no such failure, it would not be liable.
Plaintiff’s testimony showed that the .telegram was written on a letterhead of Schley Bros. & Co., and not upon the forms of the company, and that after he returned from California, defendant’s agent gave him the original to copy, and at this time it was not attached to one of defendant’s blank contracts. Defendant’s agent testified, that when he received the telegram, he at the time attached it to the blank contract, and that he was not authorized to receive or send a message unless on such blank. The testimony justified the court in finding that the blank form was not attached to the message at the time it was received by the agent.
It is, therefore, not necessary for us to decide whether there was in the blank such stipulations as would exempt the company from liability for the default of the connecting line from San Bernardino to Oceanside, the court below having decided (as we presume in favor of the judgment he did) that it was not a part of the contract. The testimony, we think, is sufficient to sustain the finding.
The defendant having received full pay for the transmission of the message through to Oceanside, without a contract limiting its liability to its own line, was bound to send the message to its destination and deliver it. Railway v. Baird, 75 Texas, 256.
We do not hold that the stipulations in the contract attached to the message would or would not absolve the company from liability according to the conditions stated. We do not enter into these questions, the judgment of the court below being supported by the conclusion that such stipulations were not a part of the contract.
This disposes of appellant’s assignments of error. Appellee having presented none, there are no other questions before us.
Because of the error of the court in allowing plaintiff to predicate a part of his damages upon the sale of his property at a sacrifice, the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is so ordered.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered February 8, 1893."
219250,F. Strauss & Co. v. H. Gross,1893-02-15,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
The original petition was filed by the appellee, H. Gross, against the appellants, F. Strauss & Co., on the 30th day of August, 1889. The amended petition was filed November 11, 1889. The action is upon a written and verbal contract.
The written contract is as follows:
“ Office of F. Strauss & Co., Wholesale Liquor Dealers,
“ No. 62 West Second Street,
“ Cincinnati, February 26, 1889.
“ This agreement, made by and between F. Strauss & Co,, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Heyman Gross, of Lampasas, Texas, witnesseth: That said F. Strauss & Co. have engaged said Heyman Gross as their travelling salesman at a salary of $200 per month from March 1, 1889, in consideration of which salary the said Heyman Gross agrees to sell such goods as the said F. Strauss & Co. handle, and to effect sales for them which shall aggregate from $35,000 to $40,000 per annum. No orders by the said Heyman Gross shall be considered as sales unless the same are approved by said F. Strauss & Co. F. Strauss & Co. furthermore agree to pay the travelling expenses of the said Heyman Gross, which shall not exceed $8.50 per day, and shall be less if possible.
“ Witness:
“Ferd H. Strauss.
F. Strauss & Co., H. Gross.”
The foregoing agreement is set out in the petition; and it is further alleged, that in addition thereto it was verbally agreed between the parties at the time and after the date of the same, and prior to March 1, 1889, that plaintiff would be paid by defendants to the extent of $150 per month, and that defendants would retain $50 per month of the salary of $200 per month until the expiration of one year from the 1st of March,, 1889, as a guaranty that plaintiff’s sales should aggregate the amount set forth in the written contract; and that he would not be required to keep an itemized account of his travelling expenses under the contract, but that he should report the same to defendant from time to time, and the-same, not to exceed $8.50 per day, would be paid by defendants as it should be reported and incurred. That pursuant to the written agreement, plaintiff, on the 1st day of March, 1889, entered upon his duties as travelling salesman for defendants, and continued faithfully to perform his duties under the contract, when on the last date, he was discharged by defendants and notified that his salary would be discontinued. That during the time he served them he had made sales for them amounting to more than $10,000, which were approved by them, during which time his travelling expenses amounted to $682.40, which were from time to time reported by him to them. That from the time of his discharge, June 1, 1889, to October 1, 1889, he diligently sought other employment, but failed to secure it, but on October 1, 1889, defendants still refusing to carry out their agreement, he found and accepted employment at $150 per month, with expenses paid by his employer. That during the time he was out of employment, from June 1 to October 1, 1889, his reasonable expenses were $125. That he has always, up to the 1st of October, 1889, been ready and willing to carry out his contract with defendants, and frequently offered to do so. That he could easily have effected sales for defendants during the year from the 1st of March, 1889, for an amount over $35,000, which would have been approved by them if they'had retained him; that the original contract did not specify Whether sales by plaintiff should be for cash or on a credit, but before the 1st of March, 1889, it was agreed that he should sell for cash or on a credit, as he might see proper.
The petition specifies the amounts which defendants are liable to pay him,. $600 salary for March, April, and May, 1889; $682.40 for his expenses, during that time; $800 as damages for his illegal discharge, the amount of salary due for the time he was out of employment, from June 1, 1889, to October 1, 1889; and §50 per month during the time he earned by other employment §150 per month from October 1, 1889, to March 1, 1890, §250; aggregating §2332.40. He admitted payment of §1000, leaving a balance due him of §1332.40, for which he asked judgment.
Defendants filed exceptions to the petition, to the effect, that it did not state a cause of action; that it seeks to recover unearned wages, and sets up a paroi agreement changing a written agreement; but the exceptions were not, it seems, called to the attention of the court; at least, there was no ruling upon them.
Defendants filed a general denial; admitted the written contract to pay plaintiff §200 per month and §8.50 per day as expenses while travelling on defendants’ business; that prior to June 1, plaintiff’s services were dispensed with, and that on that date they were due him as salary §600, due for March, April, and May, 1889; but alleged that of this sum §300 had been paid his wife at his request; that on account of the expenses for travelling due him, being §665.40, they had paid him §700, and denied that he had incurred §120 as expense since June 1, 1889, or any other sum.
Defendants alleged, that under the contract they had the right to discharge him at any time, which he knew, and fully consented thereto, and that the hiring of plaintiff was by the month. Defendants also set up, that while plaintiff was in their service he sent them an order for one W. L. Marshall, amounting to §447.08, which they refused to fill, whereupon plaintiff agreed in writing to guarantee the payment of the order if they would furnish the goods; that they did upon such guaranty fill the order, which Marshall had refused to pay, and plaintiff became indebted and bound to pay defendants the amount, for which they asked judgment. They also asked for further judgment against plaintiff for §1000 on account of his neglect of their business, and the further sum of §34.68, amount overdrawn by plaintiff for travelling expenses, making a total claimed by them against plaintiff of §148.68.
The case was tried by the court, and judgment was rendered for plaintiff for §868.32, with interest from March 1, 1889, at 8 per cent. Defendants have appealed.
The written contract was proved as alleged, and it was shown by plaintiff’s testimony that the verbal contracts set up by him were made by the parties on the same day, in the afternoon, after the written contract was executed. This was denied by the evidence of defendants.
■ It was agreed, that plaintiff worked under the contract three months, from March 1, 1889, to June 1, 1889, when the defendants repudiated the contract and discharged him; that during the three months plaintiff’s travelling expenses were §665; that on account of salary and expenses defendants have paid plaintiff §1000; and that plaintiff is liable to defendants for the Marshall debt of §447.08.
The court filed findings of facts, supported by the testimony, that the written contract was made as alleged, and that afterwards, on the same day, the verbal contract was made that defendants should retain $50 per month of plaintiff's salary as a guaranty that his sales would amount to $35,000 at the expiration of one year (the foregoing facts agreed to); that plaintiff was wrongfully discharged after he had worked three months; that plaintiff used due diligence to secure other employment, but failed to do so until October 1, 1889, when he obtained employment as alleged at $150 per month; that the contract was an employment for one year at $200 per month.
It was also proved, that plaintiff could have made sales for defendants of their goods to the amount of $35,000 or $45,000 during the year if he had not been discharged.
Appellants have assigned errors as follows:
“1. The court erred in overruling defendants’ second special exception to plaintiff’s first amended original petition.
“ 2. The court erred in overruling defendants’ third special exception to plaintiff’s first amended original petition.
“ 3. The court erred in overruling defendants’ fourth special exception to plaintiff’s petition.
“ 4. The court erred in permitting plaintiff to introduce testimony to vary the written contract, the said testimony not being of an explanatory nature.
“5. The court erred in its findings of the facts herein.
“6. The court erred in construing the instrument sued on to be a hiring by the year.
“ 7. The court erred in its declaration of the law herein.
“ 8. The court erred in finding judgment for the plaintiff.”
These assignments, except the fourth and sixth, fail to point out any specific error, and under the rules should not be considered.
The fourth assignment is not as explicit as it should be; it fails to designate the particular act of the court complained of.
We presume it refers to the testimony of plaintiff, that it was agreed by him and defendants, after the written agreement, that defendants should retain $50 per month of his salary until the end of the year, as a guaranty that he would sell as much as $35,000 or $40,000 worth of goods during the year.
It was admissible. It was a concession by plaintiff to secure the performance of the contract—an agreement collateral to the main agreement, made after it and not inconsistent therewith—and was not obnoxious to the rule, that prior and contemporaneous paroi agreements should not be admitted to vary or change the terms of a written contract. Besides, it was admissible as furnishing some explanation of the indefinite terms of the writing as to the period of employment. Thomas v. Hammond, 47 Texas, 43; 1 Greenl. Ev., secs. 282, 284a (note 2), 304 (note 4); Railway v. Jones, 82 Texas, 157.
Was it error to construe the contract as an employment for one year ?
Taking the entire contract together, the employment of plaintiff as travelling salesman at a salary of $200 per month from March 1, 1889, in consideration or conditioned that he make sales aggregating $35,000 or $45,000 per annum, it would seem that it was the intention of the parties that he was to continue in the service for one year. The year’s service was to determine his right to the stipulated salary. This view is strengthened by the subsequent agreement that defendants were to reserve $50 per month of the $200 until the end of the year as a guaranty that plaintiff would sell $35,000 or $40,000 worth of goods during the year.
It can not be held that the lower court’s construction of the contract was erroneous. On the contrary, we think it was correct.
The evidence shows that plaintiff sustained the damage ascertained by the court on account of the breach of the contract without cause by defendants, after allowing the credit of $1000 and of the Marshall account. Ho reversible error is assigned, and our opinion is that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.
Affirmed.

216273,J. Loustaunau & Co. v. Mary E. Lambert et al.,1892-11-02,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
This is a suit brought in the District Court of the Thirty-seventh Judicial District of Texas, for and in the County of Bexar, State of Texas, by Mary E. Lambert and others, creditors of Richard S. Lambert, against the appellants, J. Loustaunau and Paul Bergeron, to enjoin the said appellants from executing a certain judgment recovered by the said J. Loustaunau & Co. against Richard S. Lambert for the sum of $2625, and to restrain them from receiving and collecting from the clerk of the court the said sum, which had been realized out of the property and stock of goods of the said Richard S. Lambert, levied upon by the said Loustaunau & Co., under a distress warrant, for rents due and to become due to them from Richard S. Lambert and the appellees herein, as attaching creditors of the said Richard S. Lambert. Upon the filing of the said petition by the appellees herein a temporary injunction was issued, and upon final trial verdict and judgment were rendered in favor of the said appellees and against the appellants, enjoining the appellants from receiving or collecting any of said moneys until appellees’ judgments as creditors of said Richard S. Lambert, amounting to more than the sum of $2625, are first paid, leaving nothing to apply to appellants’ claim and judgment against said Richard S. Lambert for rents due or to become due under said lease; from which judgment the appellants, after the overruling of their motion for a new trial, have appealed.
The first assignment of error is as follows: “ The court erred in overruling defendants’ general demurrer to plaintiffs’ petition, because neither said petition nor the first supplemental pétition show any legal or equitable cause of action, in this, that plaintiffs’ said petition shows, that the appellants, J. Loustaunau & Co., were the landlords of Richard S. Lambert, and that the stock of goods owned by the said Lambert and contained in the store house rented from the appellants had been levied upon by execution and distress warrant, and that the proceeds of such goods were in the hands of the clerk of the District Court; and that the said Lambert had rented the store house from appellants under contract executed May 18, A. D. 1889, and to run for three years, beginning October 1, A. D. 1889, and that no part of said rent had been paid except $75, and that the balance due hereon, to-wit, $2625, was a lien upon said stock of goods, and appellants had a right superior to the creditors of Richard S. Lambert to have the same paid out of the proceeds of said stock of goods.”
The petition is good as against a general demurrer. It does allege that Loustaunau & Co. had leased the property, and had obtained judgment foreclosing lien upon the goods in the store, and order for the clerk to deliver to them a sufficient amount of the proceeds of the sale to satisfy the judgment; but the petition also shows, that the lease was unexpired— most of the time still to run; that the rent was to be paid $75 monthly in advance; that the plaintiffs were not parties to the judgment, assigning a satisfactory reason for not intervening in the rent suit; setting up their debts, their prior levy; that the sale of the goods was upon order of the court in the attachment suits as well as the rent suit; that defendants had assumed control of the store, and had prevented it being rented, raising the price and doing other acts indicating an abandonment of their rights under the lease.
The petition further shows, that Morgan Wilson became the owner of the leasehold estate of the absconding tenant, and so became liable for the unpaid rent, and has been ready and willing, and has tendered to Loustaunau the rent as it became due thereunder for the full term of the lease; “ that Wilson or the said Loustaunau & Co.” leased the premises to one Ben Moke on the 12th day of February, 1890, for the unexpired term for $80 per month, $75 of which was to be paid to Loustaunau & Co.; and if the lease was made by Wilson, it was so made by and with the consent of Loustaunan & Co., they requiring a further sum of $5 per month for rent of their shelving and fixtures in the house, which was a condition precedent to the leasing.
It is further alleged, that Loustaunau & Co. did receive the rent from Moke for the premises, $80 per month, up to the first day of March, 1890 (suit filed March 8, 1890); that the defendants have by their acts and conduct waived and released any lien they ever had upon the goods.
The supplemental petition, filed October 19,1891, shows that Ben Moke has, from the date of the filing of the original petition, paid defendants $80 per month rent for the premises; that all the rents due under the lease prior to that time have been fully paid; that defendants had accepted Moke as leasee of the premises for the full unexpired term of the Lambert lease, and had thereby released all lien thereunder.
We have selected the foregoing allegations from the petition as sufficient grounds for this suit and the relief asked.
If Loustaunau & Co. did not waive and relinquish their lien by their interference with the renting of the property to responsible persons, as alleged, by the receipt of rents and by their assumed control of the same before their judgment was rendered, the petitions show that they have done so since. If their rents have been paid up to the time the supplemental petition was filed, and they have accepted Moke as lessee for the remainder of the term, their judgment will be deemed satisfied, and they would have no interest in the funds deposited with the clerk. Their judgment could be satisfied by payment or by part payment and then-acceptance of another lessee for the remainder of the term.
We find the material facts in evidence on the trial as follows:
On the 18th of May, 1889, Lambert rented the premises in question for three years from Loustaunau & Co., to commence October 1, 1889, at $75 per month, in advance. After paying the first month’s rent, on the 10th of October, 1889, he abandoned the business and absconded. His wife, to whom he was indebted in the amount of $2508, and other creditors, plaintiffs herein, sued him and attached the goods in his store, the suits being brought from the 11th to the 14th of October, 1889, inclusive. On the 1st of November, 1889, Loustaunau & Co. sued out (the October rent having been paid) a distress warrant before a justice of the peace for the rent to become due for the full term of the lease, unpaid from the 1st of November, 1889, to the 1st of October, 1892 — two years and eleven months — and levied on the same goods then in the hands of the sheriff by the levy of the attachments, the distress warrant being made returnable to the next term of the District Court of Bexar County.
On the 5th of December, 1889, the landlords filed the proceedings in distress and their petition in the District Court, setting up their rental rights, and on the 12th of December, 1889, they recovered judgment against B. S. Lambert for $2625 rent, with foreclosure of landlord’s lien, and order to clerk to pay the amount out of funds in his hands to them, and the remainder to B. S. Lambert.
The creditors, plaintiffs in this suit, applied to the district judge, October 23, 1889, in vacation, for an order to sell the attached goods as perishable property, which order was granted, and the goods ordered sold on the 4th day of November, 1889; and Loustaunau & Co. obtained a similar order for sale to take place on the same day, directing the proceeds to be deposited with the clerk of the court.
Under these orders the sale was made to Coulter & Doerr for $3450, who failed to pay the amount of their bid. Thereupon other orders were made to sell the goods (upon application of the parties) on the 9th of December, 1889, which sale was made, and the net proceeds, $2820, deposited with the clerk.
Afterwards, as stated, Loustaunau & Co. obtained judgment, foreclosure, and order to the clerk to pay them the amount of their judgment and costs, and the residue to Lambert. This judgment and order were made without the knowledge of the attaching creditors.
On the 2nd of November, 1889, Wilson Bros., creditors of Lambert, levied attachment, duly sued out, on the leasehold estate of B. S. Lambert, which, by order of the court in vacation, was sold to Morgan H. Wilson for $105 by the sheriff.
On the 11th day of February, 1890, Wilson conveyed, or assigned, the leasehold to Ben Moke, the latter to pay $80 per month rent, in advance, for the unexpired term, the extra $5 over the original $75 being for the fixtures and shelving purchased by Loustaunau & Co., under sheriff’s sale, as the property of Lambert, as alleged in the petition, since which time, to the trial, he has paid the rent to Loustaunau & Co. as it fell due, having also paid to them $40 for half of the month of February, 1890. The sheriff’s deed to Morgan Wilson of the leasehold estate is dated the 11th of February, and Wilson’s deed to Moke is dated February 12, 1890. Wilson’s transfer does not state to whom the rent of $80 per month is to be paid.
On the same day of Wilson’s transfer to Moke — the 12th of February, 1890 — J. Loustaunau & Co., by writing, consented to the transfer by Wilson to Moke, and also transferred and conveyed to him all their right, title, and interest to the lease, and warranted the title.
On the same day Wilson notified Moke in writing that, for a valuable consideration paid him by Loustaunau & Co., he had assigned rents accrued and to accrue on the lease, and instructed him to pay the same to Loustaunau & Co. On same day Loustaunau & Co. executed receipt to Moke for the $40 rent, as per lease, to 1st of March, 1890. These papers were all delivered to Moke on the same day at the same time. He applied to defendants’ attorney, Bergstrom, to rent the place, understanding that Barnard, Wilson’s attorney, held the lease, and that Loustaunau & Co. were willing it should be rented on the transfer of the lease. Moke says he went to Bergstrom, and he fixed up the rent to suit himself.
The evidence justifies the conclusion, and we find, that Loustaunau & Co. assumed to control and manage the renting of the property after their levy; and that after the purchase of the lease by Barnard, attorney for Wilson Bros., for Morgan Wilson, there was' an understanding between them, Loustaunau & Co. and Barnard, that they should be protected, and that their rents should be paid according to the terms of the original lease, and that they were so protected. Barnard, for Wilson, recognized the liability of his client to a full compliance with the terms of the lease, as assignee thereof; and he assumed all the liabilities of Lambert, the original lessee, and Loustaunau & Co. have accepted such liability.
It is also fairly inferable from the facts in evidence, that Loustaunau & Co. have been paid, or are at least fully protected, to the time of trial for all rents, and have accepted Moke’s obligation as lessee or assignee of the lease for the rents to accrue, and that if they lose this suit they have accepted obligations of Wilson and Moke for their rent which fully indemnify them. And we so find the facts.
All the plaintiffs in this suit recovered judgment against R. S. Lambert, foreclosing their attachment liens on the goods levied on: Mrs. Mary E. Lambert for $2591.60 and costs of suit, on the 10th of March, 1890; Yolger & Gendtner in the sum of $158 and costs of suit, before a justice of the peace; Millie T. Matter, $158.50 and costs, on the 13th of January, 1890; and A. G. C. Matter for $1882.50 and costs of suit, on the 10th of March, 1890. All thé judgments were for just and valid debts and are still unpaid. The proceeds of the-sale of the goods are still in the hands of the clerk.
Appellants’ second assignment of error complains of the ruling in admitting the testimony of Morgan H. Wilson, J. Musin, T. H. Coulter, and W. F. Doerr, to the effect that each of them had applied to J. Loustaunau & Co. to rent the house, and that they, Loustaunau & Co., claimed a right therein and attempted to rent the same. Appellants insist that the testimony was immaterial, irrelevant, and prejudicial to them, and1 did not tend to prove that the lease to Richard S. Lambert had been can-celled or abrograted, or show any agreement upon any consideration to release the landlord’s lien upon the goods.
One of the issues made by plaintiffs’ pleadings was, that Loustaunau & Co. had by their conduct and acts inconsistent with the lease to Lambert cancelled the same; and another was, that they had in the end accepted Moke, the assignee of the original leasehold, as their lessee, by which they had cancelled the original lease and discharged the goods from their lien.
The testimony was admissible upon these issues. All the transactions and acts of Loustaunau & Co. in connection with the rented premises leading to the final result of payment of the accruing rents to them, and accepting Moke as their responsible lessee, were admissible. Any circumstance that would tend to show their relations to the property, or to those to whom the lease had been assigned, was pertinent and relevant.
When Wilson became the owner of the lease, he assumed all the obligations of the original lessee, as he was bound by law so to do; and upon the transfer of the lease to Moke, he in turn became so bound; and any fact tending to show that the landlords recognized such substitution was legitimate. Their acceptance of either of them as lessee, or as the party to whom they should look for payment of rent, such party being bound so to do in law or by contract, amounted to a waiver of lien upon the goods of the original tenant. The judgment in their favor would not interfere with their right to do so. Their lien could in this manner be discharged, even though it had been secured by judgment. Harvey v. McGrew, 44 Texas, 412; Howard v. Britton, 71 Texas, 287; Le Gierse v. Green, 61 Texas, 128; Giddings v. Felker, 70 Texas, 176.
There was no error in submitting the case to the jury; the issues and the testimony required it, and the evidence supported the verdict. The assignment of error on this point is not well taken.
There was evidence tending to establish the proposition that Loustau- . nau & Co. had waived their lien upon the goods in the rented building upon consideration of other persons becoming bound to pay the rent; and there was testimony tending to show; and we find the fact, that the rent due under the original contract had been paid to Loustaunau & Co. for their benefit, or that they were secured in the same up to the time of trial; and therefore the assignment of error objecting to the charge upon the subject can not be sustained.
For obvious reasons, before explained, there was no error in refusing to give the fourth special instruction requested by the defendant. It was not applicable to the facts, and did not present the case as made by the testimony. The facts did tend to show that Loustaunau & Co. had abandoned their original lien and accepted other obligations, and had received rent in pursuance of the same.
The fifth assignment of error can not be sustained; it objects to the following charge of the court, given by request of plaintiffs:
“ Plaintiffs ask the court to charge the jury, that if they find from the evidence that subsequent to the lease by Loustaunau & Co. the said lease was assigned and transferred to one Ben Moke, by and with the consent of said Loustaunau, or by them, and that said lease is for the whole of the unexpired term of the Lambert lease or any part thereof, provided that you find said Ben Moke was accepted by Loustaunau in lieu of Richard S. Lambert’s lease, then you will find for the plaintiffs.”
The expression, “ or any part thereof,” should, possibly, not have been used in the charge, because the undisputed evidence shows that the entire unexpired term was assigned to Moke; which, as we have before seen, rendered him liable for the performance of all the undertakings of the original lessee, for rent past due and unpaid as well as that to become due, the acceptance of such obligations by the landlords in legal effect being an acquittance of Lambert and a release of the rental lien upon the goods on the rented premises. The expression noticed, under the facts, could probably mean no more than that part of the term unexpired.
Defendants’ requested qualification of the charge, that the mere consent of Loustaunau & Co. to the assignment of the term would not establish their waiver of lien on the goods levied on, was not necessary, and it was objectionable because it was upon the weight of evidence.
It is not necessary under the facts to determine whether such consent would be of itself a waiver, because there are other facts and circumstances in evidence justifying the conclusion that Loustaunau & Co. not only consented to the assignment, but accepted the assignee as their lessee, and received payment from him at least from that time down to the time of trial, in payment of their rent. This the court submitted to the jury.
Loustaunau and his partner, Bergeron, were not on the stand.
Barnard, attorney for Wilson, testified that he was bound as Lambert was bound. The obligation of Moke, who was similarly bound as assignee, got into the hands of Loustaunau & Co., and they have collected the rent from Moke from the time of the assignment to him to the time of trial, Barnard says, as his agent; but the jury could construe the facts to mean that Loustaunau & Co. were collecting the rent on their own account, especially with Barnard’s testimony before them, that if Loustaunau & Co. did not recover in this suit, etc., but if they did recover, he (Barnard), for his client, Wilson, was to have the benefit of the judgment after deducting costs. He says they were his agents in collecting the rents, and they may have been, in the sense that they were to apply the collections of rent to the payment of his obligation, to see that the rents were paid. He testified that he was bound in law as assignee to pay the rents — bound as Lambert was; and it may be supposed that his understanding with Loustaunau was consistent with such liability.
Delivered November 2, 1892.
His evidence is commendable for candor, and he does not state that the rents when collected were his or his clients.
It seems reasonable that Loustaunau & Co. were collecting the rents to pay their claim, for which he acknowledged himself bound. We are satisfied that Loustaunau & Co. are fully protected by Wilson and Moke, whose contracts they have adopted. They should not be allowed to collect their rents twice — once out of the goods and once from the assignee of the lease, who is bound to pay them the rent. They should not be allowed to aid the assignee to avoid his obligation to pay the rent, and profit thereby at the expense of creditors of the original lessee.
Having accepted the obligations of Wilson and Moke as lessees and received rents from them, they have waived their judgment lien.
The trial below resulted as it should have done, according to the legal and equitable rights of the parties; and there being no reversible error pointed out in the proceedings, the judgment should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.
Affirmed."
219187,Houston & Texas Central Railway Company v. Heirs of James Bowie,1893-02-15,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
This is an action by the heirs of James Bowie, the original petitioners and interveners, all in the attitude of plaintiffs, against the Houston & Texas Central Eailway Company, Charles Dillingham, Nelson S. Easton, and James Eintoul, defendants, to recover 1920 acres of land in one survey and 177 acres in another, both in Hardeman County, Texas, and both located by virtue of genuine certificates issued to the heirs of James Bowie. Both surveys are described by metes and bounds in the petition, and it is alleged, that “ defendants in some manner have obtained from the General Land Office of Texas patents on certain surveys claimed by them, which cover part of the lands sued for; that defendants had no legal surveys or locations in conflict with the James Bowie survey, and said patents were improperly issued and cast a cloud upon the title of the heirs of Bowie.” Prayer that the title of plaintiffs and intervenors be established and quieted, that they recover the land from defendants, and that the patents, in so far as they conflict with the lands of the heirs sued for, be cancelled. Venue was changed to Travis County.
Defendants answered by plea of not guilty; deny that there is any conflict between the lands claimed by them and plaintiffs, but that if there be any conflict, it “is in part only, and conflicts very slightly with plaintiffs’ land.” Defendants also disclaimed title to all the surveys known as the even-numbered surveys made by defendant company in Hardeman County for the public free school fund; and also disclaimed number 19, block 44, it having been sold to Jackson & Smith, of Jefferson, Missouri.
Judgment was rendered by the court for plaintiffs and intervenors for the land sued for, that their title be established, and that all claim of title held by defendants to any of such land be cancelled, etc. Defendants appealed.
Plaintiffs and intervenors proved, that the land in suit was located by valid certificates issued to the heirs of James Bowie, and that the surveys were made by the district surveyor of Jack County on the 11th and 28th days of November, 1874, and properly returned to the General Land Office.
It was also proved that the plaintiffs and intervenors were the heirs of James Bowie.
Defendants’ surveys were made in alternate sections for the defendant railway company by the district surveyor of Jack Land District, on December 18, 1873, and were duly and properly returned to the General Land Office, the alternate odd-numbered sections for the company and the even numbers for the public school fund. Defendants’ surveys were patented in 1877, except one in 1881.
Plaintiff offered in evidence a Land Office copy of a part of a map, duly certified by the Commissioner to be a correct copy of sketch number 14-J- in Hardeman County, which is certified to be a record of the office and in use by the office, which indicates the railroad lands by black lines, and the lands located for the James Bowie heirs by red and yellow double lines.
The map clearly shows that the 1900 acres surveyed for the heirs of James Bowie covers all of section 20 and parts of sections 19, 21, 12, 18, 17, 36, 37, and 38, surveyed by the railway company for itself and the public school fund. The lands of the railway and those of the school fund are in a solid block; the land of the Bowies lies upon top of them so as to include number 20 and parts of other surveys as stated. It also shows that the Bowie labor includes parts of numbers 51, 52, and 527, surveyed for the railway company and the school fund.
Plaintiffs offered no testimony to show the conflict except the map or sketch from the Land Office, and the important question in the case, properly raised by assignment of error, is as to the competency of the testimony—the map—to prove the conflict.
The surveys of the railway company were made prior to those made for the Bowie certificates, the former in December, 1873, and the latter in November, 1874.
But the surveys made for the company were invalid, because they were made by the district surveyor of Jack Land District at a time when Hardeman County, in which the lands were situated, was not a part of that district, but was a part of the Clay Land District. In November, 1874, when the Bowie surveys were made, Hardeman County was a part of the Jack Land District, having been by act of the Legislature detached from the Clay District. General Laws of Texas, 1873, Act to create and define Clay Land District, p. 150; General Laws of Texas, 1874, Act to define land districts of Palo Pinto, Jack, Clay, Young, and Eastland, sec. 2, p. 162; Cox v. Railway, 68 Texas, 226.
Appellants have no assignment of error on this point, assuming, as it seems, that plaintiffs have title to the land sued for. We have noticed it because it is a necessary part of this case.
The surveys for the Bowie certificates were- made before the patents issued to the railway company, and secured rights in the land superior to those of defendant.
The certified copy from a sketch in use in the General Land Office was-admissible in evidence. It was not a plat made by a draughtsman from field notes and records in the office, as in the case of Railway v. Thompson, 65 Texas, 193, but a copy of an archive—a map in use in the office. Rev. Stats,, arts. 57, 2252; Smith v. Hughes, 23 Texas, 249; Boon v. Hunter, 62 Texas, 589.
It may not have been competent for the certificate of the officer to state-that the sketch correctly shows the position of Bowie surveys and of those-made for the railway company, but the certificate was sufficient in other respects to admit the copy from the map.
The court below declined to receive as evidence that part of the certificate declaring that the map correctly showed the relative positions of the surveys, but accepted the copy of the map itself as evidence of the fact. The map was evidence; the certificate was not—it was only the unsworn opinion of the Commissioner.
The map was sufficient of itself, there being no contradictory testimony, to establish the facts shown by it, that there was a conflict of the Bowie surveys with the surveys claimed by defendants, as well as others indicated thereon and figuring in the case. The court below rested his conclusion as to conflict upon the map, as he should have done, in the absence of opposing testimony.
, Defendants can not complain because the court rendered judgment against them for all the land sued for. The disclaimer of a part of the land sued for did not affect the issue as to the parts they did claim under their plea of not guilty. Had they disclaimed all the land sued for, the question would be different. Their denial of the alleged conflict was not a disclaimer. The denial, however, admitted that if there was a conflict, it was very slight. The denial did not establish the fact. The issue under their plea of not guilty as to conflict was still left in the case for trial by the court. The evidence showed a conflict with lands claimed by them, and judgment was accordingly rendered against them.
Plaintiffs showed superior title in themselves to all the land sued for, defendants claiming only a part of it by patents, clouding the title, and it was proper to render judgment for plaintiffs for all the land. The owners of other surveys in conflict with plaintiffs’ land, disclaimed by defendants, were not affected by the judgment. So far as costs are concerned, we do not see from the record that they are increased by the fact that defendants’ surveys only conflicted in part with the land of plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs’ recovery was for all the surveys sued for, as it ought to have been.
We have disposed of every material assignment of error in the foregoing, and find no error in the judgment of the court below, and it is affirmed.
Affirmed.

That sometime in the year 1837 Captain Henry Austin took out. letters of administration on the estate of said Green B. Jamison, but in 1837 or 1838 he surrendered to the honorable Probate Court said letters, without having fully administered said estate. He further represents, that said estate or the heirs thereof are entitled to considerable land from the government of Texas, and that the heir of said Jamison has requested your petitioner to ask for letters of administration on said estate, in order that said land claim may be gotten from the said government. Your petitioner therefore prays for letters de bonis non upon said estate, and for all other and necessary orders touching the same.
“Filed December 9, 1856.
[Signed] “ Thomas G. Masterson.”
Opinion.—This suit was instituted by John Jamison, as plaintiff, against E. Phelan, as defendant, to recover 1920 acres of land, patented by the State to the heirs of Green B. Jamison.
Melissa P. Dodge, W. E. Dodge, Jr., and D. Stuart Dodge, as executrix and executors of the estate of William E. Dodge, deceased, intervened, claiming the land for said estate, and impleaded William B., Mattie, Carrie B., Nannie M., and Bessie Montgomery, Mrs. S. L. Jamison (a feme sole), W. K. Henderson (as administrator of the estate of Mary S. Nuckols), and the unknown heirs of said Mary S. Nuckols.
E. Phelan impleaded two of his warrantors, asking, in the event that he lost the land claimed by him, for judgment against said warrantors.
There was no jury in the case, and the court rendered judgment against the plaintiff and also against the intervenors, and in favor of defendants as follows: Mrs. Mary S. Nuckols’ estate and Mrs. S. L. Jamison, one-half; E. Phelan, one-fourth; the Montgomerys, one-fourth; and for Ellis, and Baker, Phelan’s warrantors, for costs.
Intervenors, the representatives of the Dodge estate, have appealed.
The title of the Dodge estate is founded upon a sale made in August,. 1861, by Thomas G. Masterson, as administrator of the estate of Green B. Jamison, and the first assignment of error challenges the correctness of the court’s ruling in holding that the letters of administration granted to said Masterson as administrator de bonis non of said estate were nullities.
Green B. Jamison, to whom the certificate issued by virtue of which the land in controversy was patented, was killed at the Alamo in 1836, and between February, 1837, and July, 1840, three successive adminis-"" trators of his estate had been appointed by the Probate Court of Brazoria County; and in May, 1841, Thomas B. Davis, the last of the three, reported to the court that he was unable to find any property belonging to the estate, and at his request his letters of administration were revoked and his bond cancelled.
After the revocation of Davis’ letters of administration, no other order was made by said court in regard to the estate until the December Term, 1856, at which time Thomas G. Masterson was appointed administrator de bonis non of the estate.
Under the laws in force from 1836 to 1846, the term of an administration was limited to one year only, but could, upon sufficient cause shown, be extended by the court from year to year, not exceeding five years. Davis, the last administrator before Masterson, was appointed in June, 1840. Under the law as it then existed, his administration would have terminated in June, 1841, unless an order was made continuing it another year. This was not done; but on the contrary, in May, 1841, his letters were revoked and his bond cancelled. If this last action of the court did not close the administration, then the failure to make an order continuing it after June, 1841, did close it; and -there being no administration pending in 1856, when Masterson was appointed administrator de bonis non, the action of the court appointing him was null and void. That the admistration had terminated, see, Flores v. Howth, 5 Texas, 329; Boyle v. Forbes, 9 Texas, 36; Murphy v. Menard, 14 Texas, 65; Portis v. Cummings, 14 Texas, 139.
It becomes unnecessary, therefore, to decide the effect to be given to the fact that nothing was done in the Probate Court for over fifteen years prior to Masterson’s appointment, or to consider other matters bearing upon the validity thereof.
It is also contended, that Mary S. Nuckols was a party to the probate proceedings in which Masterson sold the certificate, and that she and those claiming under her are estopped. The evidence does not sustain this contention. It shows that Mary Nichols was represented in the partition proceedings by an attorney appointed by the court. But Nuckols and Nichols are not the same names. But if they were, the facts disclosed fall far short of an estoppel.
The judgment being void, the mere fact of an attorney appointed by the court appearing for Mary Nuckols would not operate as an estoppel against her, in the absence of proof that she received any benefit under the judgment.
It is insisted, however, that appellants were entitled to recover, on the theory that appellee Phelan had become their tenant, and was holding over after the expiration of the lease.
It is shown, that in March, 1884, while Phelan in fact owned an undivided interest in the land, he entered into a lease contract with appellants for the whole of it for a term of three years, and agreed to surrender possession at the expiration of the lease. At the time of making the lease contract, appellants’ attorney told Phelan, that in his opinion the appellants’ title to the land was superior to the title Phelan had acquired from the heirs of Green B. Jamison. When the term of the lease ended, Phelan refused to surrender possession, and held the same for himself and as tenant of Mrs. S. L. Jamison and the estate of Mrs. Mary Nuckols.
These facts brought Phelan within one of the exceptions to the general rule which does not permit a tenant to dispute his landlord’s title. Holding under a superior title to the Dodge estate, the law permits him to repudiate Ms tenancy and dispute the title of his landlord. McKie v. Anderson, 78 Texas, 207.
We find no error in the record, and the judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered February 15, 1893."
216268,"T. J. Beall, Executor, et al. v. John Evans et al.",1892-11-09,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
There was error in the court’s charge, given without qualification, that the burden of proof was upon the plaintiffs and defendants Crosby, Hills, White, and the Campbell Real Estate Company, and in refusing to charge that as to title by limitation the burden was upon the defendants setting up such title. The assignments of error upon these questions ought to be sustained.
The pleadings and the evidence placed all the parties above named in the position of plaintiffs against defendants John Evans, Allen Blocker, W. Gr. Warren, Peter Allen, Charles Dickens, and Fred Hazzard, who pleaded not guilty and limitation of ten years.
The court instructed the jury that the burden of proof was upon the plaintiffs T. J. Beall, executor, and Frank Olds, and the defendants Campbell Real Estate Company, Alvord White, J. F. Crosby, and W. S. Hills, to establish by a preponderance of proof the right to recover against the other defendants, naming them. The charge then proceeds to instruct the jury that all the parties had agreed that the title to the land in controversy was in the plaintiffs Beall, executor, and Olds, and the defendants the Campbell Real Estate Company, White, Crosby, and Hills, for the interests respectively claimed by each in their pleadings, unless the other defendants had shown themselves entitled to the same under their pleadings and proof. The jury were then directed to find for Beall, executor, Olds, the Campbell Real Estate Company, White, Crosby, and Hills, for the land claimed by them respectively, unless they should find that the other defendants were entitled to the same under instructions afterwards to be given.
The court then charged upon the plea of ten years limitation set up by these defendants, and that if the jury were satisfied it was established they were instructed to find for them.
The court also charged upon the title of these defendants by purchase from one Gillett by Evans.
Beall, executor, and Olds claimed six-eighths of the land — block 37 in the city of El Paso — an undivided interest; Crosby and Hills each claimed one-eighth undivided interest in all of the block north of the acequia running through it; and the Campbell Real Estate Company and Alvord White each claimed one-eighth undivided interest in the block south of the acequia; all of them disclaiming as to the six-eighths interest claimed by Beall, executor, and Olds, and asking judgment by cross-bill against Evans and other defendants claiming with him.
It was agreed that the record title to the block was in plaintiffs and defendants joining with them in the suit against the other defendants, except so far as the same is affected by deeds from John S. Gillett to John Evans, and deeds from Evans and others to other parties to the suit; but it was stipulated that the agreement was not to affect or impair any rights which defendants may set up and establish under their various pleas of the statute of limitations.
The charge of the court was erroneous in so far as it put the burden of proof upon the plaintiffs and the defendants joining with them in the suit against the other defendants on their plea of limitation. On this plea the onus was upon the defendants pleading it. The charge nowhere relieved plaintiffs of this burden. The testimony was uncertain and conflicting upon the issue of limitation, and required a verdict to ascertain its effect. The verdict was for defendants pleading limitation; and for aught that appears, it turned upon the instructions upon the burden of proof.
A charge was asked by appellants, which was intended to correct the error, as follows: “ The burden of proof in this case as to their title and limitation is on defendant Evans and those claiming with him by limitation, and you will not find in favor of Evans or said defendants unless the proof preponderates in favor of said Evans and said defendants under the general instructions given.”
This instruction is not accurate, as the burden of proof was upon appellants as to appellees’ title other than limitation; but it was sufficient to call the attention of the court to the necessity of shifting the burden to appellees upon their plea of limitation. The error complained of is reversible. Cunningham v. Frandtzen, 26 Texas, 34; Clark v. Hills, 67 Texas, 149.
The court instructed the jury, that if William Pierson re-entered and took possession of any part of said land by and through his tenants, Mrs. ticottens, Wesley Owens, or any other tenant, then limitation would cease to run in favor of defendants to all the land not actually occupied or cultivated , used or enjoyed, and defendants’ possession would be broken as to all the land not so occupied and enjoyed.
This charge can not be approved. There was evidence tending to show that Pierson put parties in possession of the land as his tenants. This would interrupt the constructive possession of Evans to all the land not in actual possession, if he, Pierson, had the title thereto superior to the title of Evans, because the superior title draws to it the constructive possession when there is actual possession under it. This possession under the superior title would not be defeated by mere enjoyment. The error in the charge resulted doubtless from oversight in the use of the disjunctive “ or ” instead of the copulative “ and.”
Possession under a junior or inferior title, to defeat that of the superior title, must be actual, and only such part of the premises as is in actual possession can be claimed by it. Parker v. Baines, 65 Texas, 606.
The charge of the court upon the character of possession required to sustain the plea of limitation, though in the main correct, was not as full as it should have been. To set the statute in motion under the ten years limitation, the possession must be visible, distinct, notorious, continued, and hostile for the full period of ten consecutive years while the statute was in force; it must be an actual, visible appropriation of the land, under claim of right inconsistent with the rights of the true owner, and must disseize the owner, and the claim must be of the land in suit. When limitation is set up by one tenant in common against another, it must not only amount to an ouster of the other joint tenant, but it must be of such a character and under such claim as will give notice to them of the intention to claim the whole. Mhoon v. Cain, 77 Texas, 316; Craig v. Cartwright, 65 Texas, 421, 424; Bracken v. Jones, 63 Texas, 186; Satterwhite v. Rosser, 61 Texas, 170, 172; Word v. Drouthett, 44 Texas, 373; Moody v.

Reversed and remanded."
216211,J. H. & L. W. Galbraith v. J. R. Townsend and J. E. Stanley,1892-11-09,"KEY, Associate Justice.
The appellants, who were bankers, doing business in Lampasas, Texas, brought this suit December 11, 1888, in the District Court of Lampasas County, against John Hanen and appellees, on a note for $1025, executed by them to appellants on March 25, 1888, payable ninety days after date. At the trial appellants dismissed as to defendant Hanen.
At the time of the execution of the note sued on appellants held the personal notes of John Hanen, one for $400 and the other for $718.17, and attached to each of the notes was a mortgage on sheep and the wool thereon to secure the particular note to which the mortgage was attached and all other indebtedness of said Hanen 11 then existing or which might thereafter arise.” After the execution of the note sued on the plaintiffs took another note from Hanen for $936.12, to which was attached another mortgage, securing same and all other indebtedness of said Hanen “ then existing or which might thereafter arise,” this mortgage covering the same sheep as those covered by the mortgage attached to the note for $718.17. The appellees in their answer admitted the execution and delivery of the note sued on, and answered further as follows:
That they signed said note as sureties for Hanen; that their suretyship was not only known to plaintiffs at the time the note was signed, but they signed as such sureties relying upon the representations of both Hanen and plaintiffs that all of Hanen’s indebtedness to plaintiffs, which at the time amounted to about $2243, was secured by mortgages on all of Hanen’s sheep, which then numbered about 1300 or 1400 head, of the value of about $2600 or $2800; that appellees never saw the mortgage, but relied upon the statements of plaintiffs that they held such mortgages; that plaintiffs failed to register either of said mortgages, permitted Hanen to remain in possession of the sheep, and permitted him to ship 320 head of them, of the value of $1000, out of the State of Texas, and permitted him to sell the wool of said sheep; that after the execution of the note sued on Hanen paid off the said note for $400 and said note for $718.17, and plaintiffs cancelled said notes and the mortgages thereto attached and surrendered them to Hanen, and about the time of the payment and surrender of the note for $718.17 took from him the note for $936.12 with the mortgage thereto attached; that the indebtedness secured by the mortgage last taken was in great part incurred after the execution of the note sued on; that plaintiffs foreclosed the last mortgage given without making appellees parties to the suit, taking judgment and decree of foreclosure only for amount then due on the note for $936.12, and at the foreclosure sale thereunder bid in 776 head of the sheep for $338, then being worth $1500, but the same were prevented from bringing their full value by reason of other liens being secured thereon after the execution of said mortgages, which other liens were secured by reason of plaintiffs’ failure to register their mortgages; and that by reason of such failure the appellees had lost their rights to the balance of said sheep, and other persons had acquired superior rights thereto. The appellees also alleged the insolvency of Hanen, and prayed that they be discharged from all liability on the note sued on. Appellees further prayed, that in the event it should be held that they were not entirely discharged from all liability, that plaintiffs be required to account for all of said mortgaged property, etc., and also for general relief.
'At the trial an agreement between the-parties was made and filed, by which it was agreed as follows:
1. That the note for $718.17 and mortgage attached set out in defendants’ answer was executed on February 25, 1888, and said note was can-celled April 10, 1888.
2. That the note for $400 and mortgage attached set out in defendants’ answer was executed on March 10, 1888, and said note was paid June 5, 1888.
3. That the note for $936.12 and mortgage attached set out in defendants answer was executed on April 10, 1888, and was made up with the amount of said $718.17 and interest and some cash advanced Hanen on that day, and the mortgage attached covered the same property described in the note for $718.17.
4. That no part of the judgment in favor of J. H. & L. W. Galbraith against John Hanen on said note for $936.12, a copy of which is attached to defendant’s answer, had been paid, beyond the sum of $164.13, paid on September 7, 1888.
This agreement being made, the balance of the case was submitted tó the jury on special issues, in response to which the jury found as follows:
1. Stanley and Townsend signed the note sued on as sureties, and plaintiffs knew they signed as sureties.
2. They were induced to sign the note by the declarations of plaintiffs that they held a mortgage to secure all of Hanen’s indebtedness to them.
3. Plaintiffs informed them that they held a mortgage on 1300 or 1400 head of sheep and the wool thereon.
4. At the time defendants signed the note sued on, the sheep on which plaintiffs held the mortgage were worth $2 per head.
5. The §400 note was paid off by Hanen after the execution of the note sued on, and the note and mortgage were surrendered and delivered to Hanen.
6. The note for §718.17 and the mortgage given to secure the same were surrendered to Hanen after the execution of the note, sued on.
8. Plaintiffs have realized out of the mortgaged property the $400 note and the amount received from the sale of sheep at Goldthwaite, less amount of attachment and cost, or about §167.
9. Plaintiffs did not file any of said mortgages for record. If they had done so the property would have been sufficient to satisfy all the indebtedness of Hanen and defendants to plaintiffs at the time of the execution of the note by defendants.
10. In July, Hanen shipped about 320 head of the mortgaged sheep, worth about $1.75 per head, to a foreign market. Plaintiffs permitted by not preventing such shipment; they did not authorize such shipment by special authority, but did by not preventing same.
11. The sheep that were shipped were included in the mortgage to secure the note for $718.17.
In answer to special issues submitted on request of plaintiffs, the jury found:
2. By failure to record the mortgages there were lost the sheep secured by Wood, value about $492, and the amount of the attachment at Goldthwaite.
3 and 4. The mortgages, attached to the notes for §718.17 and §400 were released by cancellation of the notes, each note and mortgage being the same instrument of writing.
In answer to special issues submitted on request of defendants, the jury found:
2. The evidence does not show that plaintiffs have accounted for all the wool of all the sheep mortgaged.
The court then, upon the said written agreement filed and the findings of the jury, rendered judgment for appellees, from which appellants have appealed.
No motion to set aside the verdict or for new trial was made.
We adopt the foregoing written agreement of the parties, and the findings of the jury in response to the special issues submitted to them, as our conclusions of facts, to be used as such, if appellants desire to carry the case to the Supreme Court.
The -first assignment of error is, that the court erred in holding that the mortgages set up in appellees’ answer were security for the note sued on.
The record does not show that the court so held. One of the defenses interposed by appellees was, that if in fact the note sued on was not secured by mortgages, that appellants had induced appellees to sign the same by representations that they held mortgages to secure all of Hanen’s indebtedness to them.
The findings of the jury sustain this plea, and the court may have been of the opinion that these mortgages did not operate as security for the debt sued for, and judgment may have been rendered on the finding of the jury referred to.
The alleged error in the second and third assignments in the ruling of the court in excluding parol evidence offered for the purpose of showing that the mortgages were not intended as security for the debts sued for, even if well taken, can not avail to reverse the ease; because if these mortgages do not secure this debt, then, as the jury found that appellees were induced to sign the note by appellants’ representations that they held mortgages to secure all of Hanen’s indebtedness, appellees are not liable. Such representations, if false and relied upon by appellees, were a fraud upon them. Brandt on Sure, and Guar., secs. 348, 352.
The fifth assignment of error is as follows: “ The evidence failing to show that the defendants Townsend and Stanley sustained any loss by failure of plaintiffs to record their mortgages, said failure to record would be no defense to plaintiffs’ cause of action.”
The sixth assignment of error is as follows: “ The surrender of the $400 note and mortgage attached upon payment of said $400 note did not operate as a cancellation or extinguishment of said mortgage, except to the extent of said $400 note, in the absence of proof of an express release of the entire mortgage.’ ’
It will be observed that these assignments do not assert that there were no findings of the jury that loss had resulted from the failure to record the mortgages, nor that the findings do not show a full cancellation of the mortgages. The jury found that by failure to record the mortgages there were lost the sheep secured by Wood, value about $492, and the amount of the attachment at Goldthwaite; and that the mortgages attached to the two notes were released by cancellation of the notes, each note and mortgage being the same instrument of writing; so these assignments must be treated as assailing these findings of the jury.
This being the case, and appellants having failed to present a motion for a new trial in the court below, asking to have the verdict and judgment set aside because not supported by the testimony, they will not be heard to urge this objection on appeal. Foster v. Smith, 1 Texas, 70; Reynolds v. Williams, 1 Texas, 311; Hart v. Ware, 8 Texas, 115; Cain v. Mack, 33 Texas, 135; Sears v. Green, Posey’s U. C., 727; 2 Thomp. on Trials, sec. 2712.
The eighth assignment of error asserts, that the appellants were not required to take any active steps against Hanen, the principal in the note sued upon, but had a right to remain inactive, and to depend for protection upon the sureties on said note.
To this proposition we do not assent. While it is true that for the purpose of having an execution run against the property of the principal, generally, it does not require, for the protection of the surety, that the payee of a note shall institute suit at any particular time, unless requested in writing to do so by the surety; yet, when property is pledged to the creditor, by mortgage or otherwise, to secure a debt, and the latter has the right to control the property, he becomes trustee for the surety as well as the principal, and he rests under the same obligations that other trustees similarly situated do. The surety, by paying the debt, has the right of subrogation to all the security held by the creditor, and the law demands of the trustee — the creditor — the exercise of reasonable care and diligence for the preservation of the property, to the end that it may be devoted to the purpose for which the trust was created — the payment of the debt.
The fourth assignment of error is as follows:
“ The judgment of the court below is contrary to law, and not supported by the evidence or findings of the jury, for the following reasons: The defendants having admitted the plaintiffs’ cause of action, as alleged by plaintiffs, and having assumed to avoid said cause of action on the following grounds:
“ 1. Because of the suretyship of defendants Townsend and Stanley, and an alleged change made by plaintiffs in the contract by which said sureties were bound.
“2. Because of the loss of certain sheep and wool belonging to the principal, John Hanen, which defendants allege were bound for the payment of the note sued on; said loss, as defendants allege, being occasioned by the failure of plaintiffs to register their chattel mortgage.
“3. Because of the loss of certain sheep belonging to the principal! John Hanen, which defendants allege were bound for the payment of the note sued on; said loss being occasioned, as defendants allege, by the shipment of 320 head of sheep out of the State by authority of the plaintiffs.
“4. Because of the release by plaintiffs of certain mortgages given by John Hanen, alleged to be security for the payment of the note sued on; and the evidence and findings of the jury being wholly insufficient to sustain either of said defenses, judgment should have been rendered for plaintiffs.”
Delivered November 9, 1892.
Appellees except to this assignment as being too general, and we think the exception is well taken.
Both the statute and the rules require that assignments of error shall specifically point out the alleged error; and the statute declares that errors not thus assigned, and not fundamental, shall be considered as waived.
This assignment is nothing more than an assertion that the judgment is not supported by the evidence and findings.
The fact that it recites the nature of the several defenses interposed by appellees, and that they had assumed the burden of proof, does not relieve the assignment from the objection made.
For the reasons already stated in regard to the fifth and sixth assignments, we can not consider the action of the jury in passing upon the testimony submitted to them; and applying this assignment to the findings of the jury and the agreed facts, the record discloses fourteen separate findings of the jury, and four distinct facts are agreed to; and appellants by this assignment say that these findings and facts do not sustain either of the four defenses set up by appellees, without specifying wherein they fail so to do.
Repeated decisions of the Supreme Court have held such assignments to be too general. Yoe & Harris v. Montgomery, 68 Texas, 338; Ackerman v. Huff, 71 Texas, 317; Sup. Ct. Rules 25, 26; Rev. Stats., art. 1037, and cases there cited.
The seventh assignment of error, to the effect that the surrender of the $718.17 note and mortgage attached, and taking a new note for $936.12 with mortgage attached, on the same property, the new note including the debt for which the old one was given and some cash advanced, did not constitute a change in the contract entered into by appellees, or operate as a cancellation or extinguishment of the first mortgage, even if well taken, can not result in a reversal of the judgment; because, if it be conceded that there was no change made in appellees’ contract of surety-ship, still there were other defenses set up in their answer, and for want of a sufficient assignment of error we are precluded from considering whether or not they are sustained; and because that portion of this assignment which alleges that there was no cancellation or extinguishment of the first mortgage named therein, in effect, assails the finding of the jury that the mortgage was released, which, as heretofore shown, can not be done in this case, because there was no motion for a new trial made in the court below.
No reversible error is assigned, and the judgment is affirmed.

219261,J. C. League v. The Buena Ventura Stock Company,1893-02-15,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
Appellant sued appellee in trespass to try title for certain lands. The case was tried by the court without a jury, and judgment rendered in favor of appellee.
We find the following to be the facts in this case as shown by the record:
It is agreed that plaintiff has title to the land under conveyance, by decree and commissioners’ deed duly recorded February, 1889, executed September 4, 1888, and which conveys the title in A. Pope, M. J. Hall, and W. T. Scott, trustees; and defendant has title to the land by unrecorded deed from said Pope, Hall, and Scott, common source, executed January 12, 1863; and the question in the case as to title is, is the plaintiff an innocent purchaser without notice of said unrecorded deed?
Plaintiff testified in his own behalf, by deposition: That he bought the land sued for and a large amount of other land for $20,000, cash paid by him on the approval of title by his attorneys, McLemore <& Campbell, of Galveston. That he was in Europe when he bought and paid for the land; that his attorneys examined and approved the title of record of the land sued for, and that he never was on the land, and neither personally nor by his attorneys made any inquiry as to whether there was any one in possession of said land, and he had no knowledge or information as to whether or not any one was on the land or claimed it at the time he bought and paid for said land.
J. W. Skinner, witness for defendant, testified: 1 i That he is and has been secretary of the defendant since 1882, and manager of defendant’s ranch and pasture from 1882 to this time. That he is familiar with location of Southern Pacific survey number 205, sued for. It is within defendant’s pasture, and the fence that divides defendant’s pasture from one adjoining is on the line of the west side-of the said survey number 205. That this fence was built by one Butler, in 1885, who owned adjoining land, before defendant fenced its pasture, and defendant joined on and used this fence of Butler’s as part of its enclosure fence when it fenced, in the spring of 1886. That defendant’s pasture is well fenced with one smooth and three barbed wires, and the pasture contains about 28,000 acres, perhaps a little more, and there are no cross-fences, but is all one big pasture, except a small pasture around the ranch house. That part of west line fence belongs to Anson & Verner, whose lands are next-to defendant’s, and encloses Anson & Verner’s pasture also. That defendant claims all the land in the pasture fences aforesaid, as owner or lessee, except 800 acres, on which Cross has filed, and defendant has a contract with Cross to buy that land if he gets patent.
<( There is also about 80 acres in this pasture owned by one Pruit, who lives on it, and defendant has no lease on it, and does not own or- claim to own it. That Pruit is postmaster of Yigo postoffice, which- he keeps on his said land; that Pruit has some milch cows, hogs, and two horses that run at large in the pasture, and defendant does not make any charge for Pruit so using the pasture; that witness thinks Pruit has a right to so use the pasture by reason of owning land thereon. That said pasture is about seven miles long by five or six miles wide.
“ That defendant now and for many years has 'used this pasture exclusively for grazing cattle and horses, and has so used the same ever since said pasture fence was completed in the spring of 1886.
“ Defendant owns and claims all the land enclosed in said pasture under deeds and leases, except Fruit’s 80 acres tract, on which Pruit lives, and has so claimed said land ever since the pasture was enclosed in 1886. I have been in the employ of defendant on said ranch since the date of its incorporation in 1883, and in the employ of De Renne, from whom the defendant bought the land in suit, since 1882, and said tract of land has been used continuously as part of said ranch for grazing horses and cattle on it ever since I have been on the ranch, and ever since said pasture was enclosed as part of defendant’s ranch and pasture. Defendant owns an interest in the fence built by Butler in 1885, on the west line of said tract of land as a division fence between Butler’s land and defendant’s land, and has owned an interest in said west line division fence since the pasture was enclosed in 1886. Defendant and De Renne have paid taxes on said land ever since 1883.
‘6 Neither plaintiff nor any agent for plaintiff has ever made any inquiry of me or of any one on the ranch about defendant’s title or possession of said land.”
The above constitutes the entire facts as shown by the record.
From these facts we conclude that the appellee had such possession of the land in controversy as would put the appellant upon notice of its title.
An agreement in the statement of facts reduces the case to the one question of whether the defendant had such possession as to be constructive notice to appellant, as a subsequent purchaser, of the unrecorded deed under which appellee holds. Did the enclosure of the survey in question within the limits of the large pasture, and used by the appellee for pasturage purposes, constitute such possession as to confer constructive notice of the title under which it claimed ?
Under facts showing possession similar to this case, it has been held in the cases of Taliaferro v. Butler, 77 Texas, 580, and Church v. Waggoner, 78 Texas, 201, that the possession by the owner of a large pasture of a smaller tract included within its limits, using it for grazing purposes in common with his lands within his enclosure, is such possession as will protect him under the statutes of limitation; and other elements of the statute being shown, he is entitled to recover under his pleas of limitation The rule announced in those cases we think decisive of the question before us. If such possession under these circumstances is held to be actual, continuous, and adverse, which must be the case in asserting a possession under the statutes of limitations, we think it is certainly sufficient to put a subsequent purchaser upon notice of the rights of the possessor of the land. The possession sufficient to constitute notice must be open, actual, and visible. No greater degree of certainty or notoriety is required in cases of this kind than exists in cases where the possession is asserted under the statues of limitations.
We think the facts show such possession by appellee as was sufficient to put a subsequent purchaser upon inquiry as to its title.
The judgment of the court below is affirmed.

Delivered February 15, 1893."
219049,J. H. Turner v. R. E. Brooks and J. C. Penn,1893-02-22,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
This is a suit brought by the appellee R. E. Brooks against J. H. Turner, R. E. Huff, and appellee J. C. Penn, in the County Court of Williamson County; plaintiff alleged to be a resident of Williamson County, defendant Turner alleged to be a resident of Rusk County, Huff of Wichita County, and Penn of Williamson County.
It is alleged in the original petition, that on the 5th day of February, 1890, Turner, by his agent, Huff, by contract in writing, sold to plaintiff and Penn lots 8 and 9 in block 150 in the town of Wichita Falls; Huff at the time executing to the vendees the following receipt or contract of sale:
“ Wichita Falls, February 5, 1890.
“ Received of John C. Penn and R. E. Brooks $250 on sale of lots 8 and 9, block 150, town of Wichita Falls, Texas, sold to them for $2750, $1000 cash, $875 in six months, and $875 in twelve months, with interest at 10 per cent, grantees to pay taxes of 1890.
[Signed] ‘1 Robt. E. Huff,
“Agent of J. H. Turner.”
This instrument is declared on as a contract to sell the lots to Brooks and Penn upon the terms stated therein; and it is alleged, that at the time the contract was entered into Brooks and Penn paid to Huff, agent, $250, to be applied on the cash payment, defendant Huff asking a few days to get the deed signed by Turner, who lived at Rusk, Texas, which was granted by the vendees. That in the meantime Brooks and Penn had made a contract of sale of the lots to William R. Emery and John A. W. Kinse, for $3000, to be paid $1250 cash, and they to assume payment of the two notes for $875 each to Turner; Huff being fully apprised of such sale at the time of his contract for Turner with Brooks and Penn. That afterward, Huff received a deed to the premises from Turner, with instructions to deliver the same to Brooks and Penn according to the contract, at which time, to-wit, on the 20th day of February, 1890, they made a tender to Huff of $750, the balance of the cash payment, and their two notes for $875 each, due in six and twelve months, with interest at 10 per cent, and at the same time demanded the deed then in Huff’s possession. That Huff, with intent to defraud plaintiff and Penn, and to appropriate the $250 paid him to his own use, refused to accept the balanee due on the purchase and the notes from Brooks and Penn, or to carry out the contract.
It is alleged, that plaintiff and Penn made a second tender of the cash payment and the notes, on the 21st day of February, 1890, and demanded the deed, and Huff again refused compliance. Thereupon Brooks and Penn demanded the $250 paid Huff, which he refused to pay or return, to damage $250. That thereafter, Turner, with full knowledge of the facts stated, received from Huff $125 of the $250, and ratified the acts of Huff, to plaintiff’s damage $500.
It is further alleged, that Penn, for a valuable consideration, transferred his one-half of the claim of $500 against Turner and Huff to the plaintiff Brooks, and in writing guaranteed the payment thereof to the extent of $125 with interest, whereby Penn became liable to the plaintiff for the amount. Refusal by defendants to pay any part of the amount is alleged, wherefore plaintiff prays for judgment, etc., according to the liabilities set out.
Turner and Huff filed sworn pleas to the jurisdiction of the court, on the ground of their residence, and that the court had no jurisdiction of the amount claimed against Penn ($125), which were overruled. They presented demurrers to the petition upon the same ground, which were overruled. Turner excepted to the petition, because it alleged that he had made the deed and instructed Huff to deliver it, which he refused to do, for the purpose of appropriating the $250 to his own use, and no cause of action was shown against Turner.
Defendants answered, that the transfer of the account by Penn to Brooks was colorable only, and was made for the purpose of giving jurisdiction to Williamson County.
There were verdict and judgment for plaintiff against Turner for $306.34, and against Penn as guarantor for $125 of the amount, and in favor of Huff. Turner has appealed.
It is insisted by the appellant, by his first proposition under the first assignment of error to the action of the court in overruling the exceptions and plea to the jurisdiction of the court, that the court must first have jurisdiction over the resident defendant before it can acquire jurisdiction over a nonresident joined in the suit.
The proposition assumes that the court had no jurisdiction over Penn. The petition shows that plaintiff and Penn had a cause of action against Turner and Huff in amount sufficient to give jurisdiction to the County Court; that Penn had sold his half of the claim to plaintiff Brooks, and guaranteed the payment of it to the amount of $125. Penn was a proper party. The statute allowing suit to be brought in the county of the residence of one defendant makes no distinction as to the character of his liability, whether primary or as security. Rev. Stats., art. 1198, sec. 4.
He must be a proper or necessary party, and not a fictitious party. Christie v. Gunter, 26 Texas, 700; Holloway v. Blum, 60 Texas, 625.
But the makers of a promissory note may be sued in the precinct of the endorser, and a plea of nonresidence of the makers in the precinct of suit is not good unless it denies the jurisdiction over the endorser. Graves v. Bank, 77 Texas, 555.
The'fact that Penn’s liability as guarantor was only $125, and not of itself within the jurisdiction of the court, would not deprive the court of jurisdiction of his liability, the amount of the entire liability sued on being sufficient to give the court jurisdiction. It could not be held that plaintiff would be compelled to sue the principals for the $250 or 8500 in the County Court, and after judgment sue the guarantor in the Justice Court. Even when a counter-claim is set up which exceeds the jurisdiction of the court, it controls jurisdiction, and the court can not act. 1 W. & W. C. C., sec. 273.
The larger amount involved will control jurisdiction.
Under the pleadings, the court had jurisdiction of the entire claim amount, and as a consequence had jurisdiction of the part guaranteed by Penn. Hamilton v. Wilkerson, 1 W. & W. C. C., secs., 556, 1165. The suit was properly brought in the county of Penn’s residence.
The averment in the answer, that the purpose of the transfer was to confer jurisdiction, and that the transfer was fictitious, can not be sustained. Without dispute, the evidence shows that the transfer and guaranty were genuine and for a valuable consideration, and though the object, in part, was to give jurisdiction to Williamson County, the transfer being valid and binding, therefore was not a fraud upon the court’s jurisdiction.
It was not error to overrule appellant’s exception to the petition, upon the ground that it alleged that Turner had prepared the deed and sent it on to Huff to deliver, and that he, Huff, refused to deliver it, with intent to appropriate the $250 to his own use. It is also alleged, that Turner, with full knowledge of the facts, received $125 of the amount, and ratified the acts of the agent.
It is insisted that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury, as requested by Turner, to the effect, that if Brooks and Penn did not assent to the terms of the contract, as stated in the deed and letter sent by Turner to Huff, and if Turner did not assent to the contract sued on, plaintiff could not recover for any amount of money paid by Brooks and Penn to Huff. The deed sent by Turner to Huff to deliver to Brooks and Penn states as a consideration substantially the same terms as the receipt given by Huff, which shows that he had consented to the sale made by Huff. The deed was not different in any material respect from the receipt. Turner directed his agent to insert in the notes an additional obligation of the payees to pay attorney fees in case of suit on the notes, which was done, and Brooks and Penn offered to comply, but the agent refused, because of a maturity clause in the notes different from the receipt.
But apart from this, Turner would be liable for the amount paid to Huff, if in fact there was no assent of the parties to the contract. The fact that there was no assent to the contract, or, in other words, that there was no consummation of the contract upon the terms proposed by either side, would furnish the best reason why Turner should not keep the money of Brooks and Penn. The evidence does not explain why he allowed his agent to retain one-half of this payment, nor does it show that he did not know the agent had received the amount. His receiving the money bound him to return it, if there was no assent to the contract.
There was no error in allowing plaintiff to prove that he and Penn, during the time the sale was pending, sold the lots for $3000, a profit of $250. The evidence was not offered to recover profits, and was not admissible for that purpose, there being no allegation of such damages, and the proof failing to show that Turner knew of such sale, though Huff is shown to have known it. The testimony was offered, and was legitimate, upon the question of the value of the lots. The measure of damage for the breach of the contract was the difference in the value and the price to be paid by Brooks and Penn. The jury only allowed about $50 as damages for the breach of the contract, not the profits lost.
We do not find that there was reversible error in the court’s charge directing the jury to find for plaintiff the $250 paid Huff in any event. Under the facts, the charge was proper. There is no doubt but that Turner and Huff refused to comply with the contract made by Huff as Turner’s agent when he received the money—refused by adding obligations to the agreement not in the contract with Huff; there is no doubt but that Brooks and Penn offered full compliance according to that original contract, which was rejected. This breach of the contract, or failure to fully consent to it, and his stipulating other onerous terms, gave Brooks and Penn the right to declare the original contract at an end, and gave them the right to decline making the contract as proposed, in which case they were entitled to at least the amount of money advanced on the original contract. Had this been the only question, the court should have directed the jury to find for the plaintiff the amount paid.
We are of opinion that the justice of the case has been attained, and that there is no reversible error in the proceedings.
The judgment is therefore affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered February 22, 1893."
216238,Anna Ritz et al. v. The City of Austin,1892-11-09,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
Alfred B. Bitz, deceased, in his lifetime sued the city of Austin for damages for injuries received on account of a defective and improper street in said city, by the overturning of his wagon. Suit was instituted July, 1885. The case was, in the lifetime of Alfred B. Bitz, tried, and judgment had in his favor, the date of the judgment being March 20, 1886. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court upon a cost bond. Pending the appeal, Alfred B. Bitz, on July 17, 1886, died, and left a written will bequeathing all of his property, including this judgment, to his wife Anna Bitz, one of the appellants, and making her sole executrix. The will was duly probated, and Anna Bitz qualified as sole executrix. After the death of Alfred B. Bitz, the Supreme Court, on the 4th day of December, 1888, reversed the said judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. On the 11th of November, 1889, Anna Bitz, executrix of Alfred B. Bitz, deceased, in her right as executrix, and also in her right as surviving wife, and Helen Bitz, Budolf B. Bitz, Clara Hesse, and Mary Schmidt, as the sole and only children of said Alfred B. Bitz, deceased, made themselves parties to this suit-by an amended original petition, and sought to revive this suit; the said Clara Hesse, a married woman, being joined by Paul Hesse, her husband, and Mary Schmidt, also a married woman, being joined by her husband, Victor Schmidt; the said Helen Bitz being a minor and appearing by Anna Ritz, her mother, as next friend, and a guardian ad litem being also asked to be appointed for her; the children of Alfred R. Ritz making themselves parties, provided they had any interest and were necessary parties, but they claimed no interest adverse to their mother, Anna Ritz.
Appellants’ amended original petition contained two counts, By the first count they sought to revive the suit as originally brought by Alfred R. Ritz; by the second count appellants sought to change the suit so as to recover under the statute allowing the surviving wife and children to sue for damages for injuries resulting in death.
Appellee answered:.
1. By a plea in abatement of the pendency of another suit for same cause of action.
■ 2. By .plea in abatement that appellants’ petition showed that suit was originally brought by Alfred R. Ritz, and that he had died, and being dead, the cause of action abated.
3. That there is a misjoinder of causes of action. Appellants seek to recover damages for personal injuries received by said Alfred R. Ritz, and for damages alleged to have been sustained by appellants by reason of death of Alfred R- Ritz.
4. General and special demurrers.
5. General denial, and special answer denying that Trinity Street at date of injury was a public streeet; that the use of the same by the public was without appellee’s knowledge or consent; that the street was in a reasonably good condition; that Alfred R. Ritz, by his own carelessness and negligence, caused the injury.
The demurrers and exceptions of appellees coming on to.be heard, the court entered the following judgment:
1. The right of action, as originally brought by Alfred R. Ritz, does not survive, and that Mrs. Anna Ritz, the surviving widow, nor the said children, take nor can take any right by reason of the injury complained of to said Alfred R. Ritz prior to his death.
2- That the statutes (Revised Statutes, article 2899) do not give the right of action for injuries causing the death of a human being when caused by a municipal corporation, unless facts be alleged showing, that .such corporation is a common carrier. Also special exception pleading limitation, sustained as to the plaintiff Anna Ritz and overruled as to the Other plaintiffs.
3.. All other and special exceptions are overruled.
4. That appellants’ cause of action be dismissed.
The court found and filed the following conclusions of law:
1. The Constitution (section 26, article 16) was intended to allow exemplary damages for gross negligence, and against such persons, corporations, and companies only as were liable under the statutes for actual damages. . . . .
2. A municipal corporation is not liable to a surviving spouse or children for damages for negligently causing the death of a husband and father, unless facts be alleged showing that such corporation was acting as a common carrier, and as such caused the death. Eev. Stats., art. 2899, subdiv. 1. Such corporations do not come within the purview of subdivision 2 of said article, because the word person, as therein used, evidently means natural person, and the word another means a similar or like person.
4. Defendant’s special exception pleading the statute of limitations is well taken as to plaintiff Anna Eitz, but not as to the other plaintiffs, who are shown to be married women and minors.
5. That the right of A. E. Eitz to recover damages for personal injuries occasioned by the negligence of defendant abated with his death, and plaintiff Anna Eitz, his surviving wife, can not maintain a suit'for the same or any part thereof.
We will not enter into a discussion of all the questions raised under the several assignments of error, as we dispose of the case in accordance with the first and second conclusions of law arrived at by the trial court.
It will be seen from these conclusions that the court sustained the demurrers, upon the grounds:
1. That municipal corporations are not embraced within the meaning of subdivisions 1 and 2 of article 2899, Eevised Statutes, as the person or class against whom the action exists for injury resulting in death.
2. That section 26, article 16, of the Constitution of this State, does not confer a right to recover exemplary damages in cases where the plaintiff is not entitled to recover actual damages.
In other words, that a recovery of exemplary damages will only be permitted when under the facts the plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages.
The appellants do not contend that a municipal corporation is embraced within the meaning of the first subdivision of article 2899, but contend that it is a person within the meaning of the law, and is therefore included within the second subdivision of the statutes.
The statute in question is as follows: “An action for actual damages on ground of injuries causing the death of another person may be brought in the following cases: * * * When the death of any person is caused by the wrongful act or negligence or unskillfulness or fault of another.”
This latter is the language of the second subdivision. The word “ person” as used in this statute is evidently meant a natural person and not an artificial person, such as a corporation. The word “another” evidently refers to another person, as a class of persons similar to that whose death is occasioned.
In construing this statute, our Supreme Court, in the case of Hendrick v. Walton, 69 Texas, 192, in effect, holds, that the statutes give the remedy only against the person or individual that occasions the death, and that a principal can not be held liable under the statutes when the death of a decedent is occasioned by his agent.
This construction is based upon the- broad ground that the remedy is granted solely against those expressly held liable by the terms of the statute, and that it will not be held to include others not specially mentioned; that the remedy exists alone against the person that occasioned the death by his wrongful act.
It is true that the question before us was not directly involved in the case cited, but it is important in its bearing upon the construction to be placed upon the statute; it is further important as illustrative of the legislative intention to not include corporations within the meaning of the term “ persons ” as mentioned in the statute. For the corporation itself does no act that renders it liable, but its liability for actionable negligence rests upon the acts of commission or omission of its agents and public servants that are entrusted with its business affairs.
It is insisted that, by force of article 3140, Revised Statutes, the word “persons” includes a corporation. The statute so says; but the article in question that undertakes to give the legal meaning to certain words says that such shall be the meaning unless a different meaning is apparent from the context.
If we give to the word a literal meaning, as defined by the law, and say that it means a corporation, this would lead to the result of holding that the physical death of a corporation was possible, and that those who occasioned it should suffer the penalty of the statute. This would lead to a palpable reductio ad absurdum.
The argument upon this question could be continued indefinitely, but we are content to say that the words “ person” and “another,” as used in the statute, are employed in their popular sense, and mean an individual and not an artificial person.
The second conclusion of law found by the court involves the application of section 26, article 16, of the Constitution, to the facts of this case.
The provision of the Constitution in question confers the remedy for exemplary damages against any person, corporation, or company that may commit a homicide through willful act or omission or gross neglect, without regard to criminal proceedings that may be had in relation to the homicide.
Appellants contend that this provision of the Constitution gives an action for exemplary damages independent of those provisions of the statute that provide for recovery of actual damages, and that such exemplary damages are recoverable, although no recovery is had for actual damages.
Our courts have repeatedly held that no recovery can be had for exemplary damages unless the facts are such that warrant a recovery for actual damages.
Delivered November 9, 1892.
We think these decisions control the question before us. The purpose of this constitutional provision was simply to create a remedy that did not exist at common law. The fact that exemplary damages are recoverable by force of this constitutional provision does not place the right upon a more certain basis or higher plain than exist in those cases in which such character of damages is recoverable at common law. In that class of cases in which it is permitted by common law to recover exemplary damages the remedy is as effective and certain as when the right is granted by the written law. Reasons upon which these decisions referred to are based will apply as well in case where the right to exemplary damages is dependent upon the written law as it does when the right flows from the common law; and in all such cases the decisions apply.
We find no error in the judgment, and it is affirmed.
Affirmed.

219079,J. C. Moses et al. v. W. C. Dibrell et al.,1893-02-22,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
Action of trespass to try title by J. C. Moses and others, plaintiffs in error, against W. C. Dibrell and G-. K. Elkins, defendants in error, brought on the 18th day of August, 1888, for two 640 acres surveys of land, patented to the heirs of David Moses, known as surveys numbers 499 and 500, the former by virtue of bounty warrant issued to the heirs of David Moses, and the latter by donation warrant issued to such heirs, patents dated respectively March 18, 1858, and March 22, 1858.
Defendants pleaded not guilty; Dibrell setting up statute of limitation of five and of ten years to survey number 499, and Elkins same pleas of limitation to survey number 500.
Upon trial, March 5, 1890, the jury returned a verdict for defendants as follows, “We, the jury, find for the defendants on the' grounds of limitation; ” and judgment was accordingly entered for them for the land respectively claimed by each.
Plaintiffs have brought the case to this court by writ of error. There is no brief on file for defendants in error.
The first assignment of error is: “The court erred in admitting in evidence the deed purporting to have been executed by N. R. May, as attorney in fact and agent for H. D. Moses and Amanda Shed, of date May 20, 1875, for the reasons set out in bills of exceptions numbers 1, 2, and 6.”
Before the trial, March 4, 1889, plaintiffs demanded the filing by defendants of an abstract of their title, which was done on the 23d of March, 1889, as follows for G-. K. Elkins:
“ 1. Power of attorney from H. Moses to N. R. May, dated October 12, 1873, to sell and sign deeds to the David Moses surveys of land in Coleman County, Texas, recorded in book D, records Brown County, page 282; said power of attorney now lost, and said records of Brown County now destroyed, and no certified copy procurable.
“2. Deed of H. D. Moses and Amanda Shed, legal heirs of David Moses, deceased, by their attorney N. R. May, to G-. K. Elkins, same being a warranty deed from said parties to said Elkins, conveying two 640 acres tracts of land in Coleman County, Texas, patented to the- heirs of David Moses, deceased, known as surveys numbers 499 and 500. Acknowledged before J. T. Rankin, clerk District Court, Brown County, Texas, January 26, 1875; recorded in book A, records of deeds of Coleman County, pages 173, 174, 175, May 23, 1876.
“ 3. Power of attorney from David Entriken and Amanda F. S. Entriken to L. G. Moses, dated March 8, 1854, authorizing L. Gf. Moses to procure, locate, and sell all lands belonging to them from State of Texas as heirs of David Moses, deceased. Acknowledged before Thomas G-. Sims, one of the justices of the Inferior Court of Coweta County, Georgia, 8th of March, 1854; original on file in Land Office, and copy recorded in Coleman County, book L, pages 517, 518, and 519, February 3, 1885.
“ 4. Deed to Arthur J. Lott from L. G. Moses for self and attorney in fact for Amanda F. S. Entriken and David Entriken, conveying two tracts of land in Coleman County, Texas, known as surveys numbers 499 and 500, patented to the heirs of David Moses, deceased, deed dated November 29, 1856. Acknowledged before Geo. W. Campbell, notary public, in Washington County, Texas, November 29, 1856; recorded in Coleman County, Texas, February 17, 1885, book L, 519, 520, and 521.
“ 5. Deed of W. L. Davidson to G. K. Elkins, same two surveys. Acknowledged January 4, 1886, and recorded in Coleman County, July 14, 1886.
“ 6. Original patent survey number 500, date March 22, 1858.”
Defendant Dibrell adopts the abstract above, except number 6, and makes for himself the following:
“1. Deed from G. K. Elkins to W. M. Erath to survey number 499, of 640 acres, patented to the heirs of David Moses, in Coleman County, Texas, dated October 17, 1882. Acknowledged before L. C. Williamson, county clerk Coleman County, Texas, October 17, 1882, book G, 579 and 580.
1 ‘ 2. Deed from W. M. Erath to W. C. Dibrell, conveying same land as above in number 1, dated October 2, 1883. Acknowledged before L. C. Williamson, county clerk Coleman County, Texas, October 2, 1883; recorded in Coleman County, October 4, 1885, book K, 220.
“ 3. Copy of patent from the State of Texas to said survey number 499 to heirs of David Moses.”
The abstract also shows, that Elkins claims survey number 500 by limitation of five and ten years, and that Dibrell so claims survey number 499; and also both parties defendant set up outstanding title in L. G-. Moses and Amanda F. S. Entriken.
On the 14 of October, 1889, James C. Moses, one of the plaintiffs, filed his affidavit, declaring that the power of attorney from H. Moses to N. R. May, of date October 12, 1873, was a forgery.
The patents to the land were read in evidence, and there was proof tending to show that plaintiffs were the heirs of David Moses, to whose heirs the certificates were issued and the patents were granted.
Defendants’ evidence tended to show, that the David Moses to Vhose heirs the certificates and the patents were issued was another man, a married man, and died in 1835 in Texas, leaving surviving him two children, his only heirs—a son, L. Gr. Moses, and a daughter, Amanda F. S. Moses; that the L. G-. Moses who, for himself and as attorney in fact for Amanda F. S.'Entriken, executed the deed to Arthur J. Lott, was an heir of David Moses, the married man, and that Mrs. Entriken was his daughter; and that W. L. Davidson, who conveyed the land to defendant Gr. K. Elkins, was an heir of Arthur J. Lott.
Defendants read in evidence the deed by N. R. May, referred to in the abstract of title as “ attorney in fact for H. D. Moses and Amanda Shed, legal heirs of David Moses, deceased, to Gr. K. Elkins,” conveying the two 640 acres surveys in controversy, dated February 2, 1875, recorded in Coleman County, where the land is situated, May 16, 1876, in book A, pages 173, 174, and 175, “ the certificate of registration in Coleman County being attested by the signature of the county clerk with the seal of the District Court of Coleman County;” the certificate of acknowledgment being as follows:
“ The State of Texas, Brown County.—Before me, John Y. Rankin, clerk District Court in and for said county of Brown, in the State of Texas, duly Commissioned and qualified, this day came and personally appeared N. R. May, agent and attorney in fact for H. D. Moses and Amanda Shed, of Pike County, Georgia, to me well known, formerly of the county of Freestone, to me personally known, who signed the names of said Moses and Shed as their agent and attorney in fact, and being by me duly sworn, signed and acknowledged the execution of the foregoing deed dated the 26th day of January, A. D. 1875, and delivered the same as their binding act and deed for the purposes and consideration herein set forth and contained.
1 ‘ Given under my hand and official seal, at office in Brown wood, Texas, this the 26th day of January, A. D. 1875.
[Seal attached] “ J. Y. Rankin,
“ Clerk District Court Brown County, Texas.”
Defendants also introduced the record book of Coleman County, deed records, containing the record of the above deed, together with a certified copy of said deed under the hand and seal of county clerk of Coleman County, showing registration of deed in Coleman County, Texas, May 16, 1876.
Defendants also introduced warranty deed by G. K. Elkins to W. M. Erath, conveying survey number 499 for 640""acres (being one of the tracts of land in controversy), dated October 17, 1882, duly recorded October 17, 1882, in Coleman County, Texas.
Also, warranty deed by Erath to defendant Dibrell to survey 499 (same conveyed by Elkins to Erath, both mentioned in the abstract of title),. dated October 17, 1883, duly recorded in Coleman County on same day.
Also, of L. G-. Moses, for himself and as attorney in fact for David Entriken and Amanda S. F. Entriken his wife, to Arthur J. Lott, conveying the land in suit, dated November 29, 1856, as conveying the interest of L. Gr. Moses only; recorded in Travis County April 12, 1858, and recorded in Coleman County February 3, 1885.
Also, warranty deed by Davidson to G-. K. Elkins, defendant, conveying his undivided one-half of both surveys in suit, dated January 1, 1886, recorded in Coleman County, Texas, July 6, 1886.
The evidence was sufficient to support the finding of the jury (if the verdict included such finding), that the David Moses under whom plaintiffs claim was the person to whose heirs the certificates were issued and the patents to the land in suit were granted.
The evidence supports the finding of the jury, and we find, from the uncontradicted testimony, that defendant Elkins had adverse and continuous possession of survey number 500 from the time he bought from May (January 21, 1875), to the time this suit was instituted (August, 1888), claiming under the May deed and paying all the taxes; and that he had such possession in person for the year 1875, and by tenant after-wards up to the time he sold to Erath, of survey number 499, paying all the taxes; and that Erath had such possession of the same under his deed from Elkins, paying the taxes up to the time he sold to Dibrell, who in turn took possession at once under his deed and held possession until suit was brought; and that portions of such surveys were so occupied by the parties, and cultivated each and every year, from the time of entry to the time of suit. On this subject there is no conflict in the testimony.
Under the first assignment of error, the first proposition by the plaintiff is, that “when a deed or a power of attorney under which it is executed is a forgery, it is error to admit it in evidence without proof of its execution as at common law.”
This is true as to the instrument itself attacked by proper affidavit as a forgery. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 2257; Belcher v. Fox, 60 Texas, 528.
But the statute prescribes no such rule of evidence as to a duly recorded deed or instrument executed by virtue of a power of attorney which is alleged to be a forgery. After filing the affidavit, the statute puts in issue the execution of the instrument so attacked, and puts the burden of proof Upon the party offering it, but expressly declares, that every instrument duly recorded, as required by law, shall be admitted in evidence without proof of its execution, unless attacked as a forgery. The statute lays down a rule of evidence, and the deed in question, if duly proven for record, other provisions of the law having been complied with, and there being as to it no issue of forgery, was admissible as a recorded instrument. Hancock v. Lumber Co., 65 Texas, 232.
Plaintiffs also objected to the introduction of the deed by May to Elkins, on the ground that the certificate of registration by the county clerk of Coleman County was attested by the seal of the District Court. The deed was recorded Hay 16, 1876.
The objection, if tenable, was fully met and obviated by the production of the record book itself from Coleman County, which contained the record of the deed, and a certified copy under the hand and seal of the county clerk of Coleman County, showing the registration of the deed in the county May 1.6, 1876. . Eev. Stats., art. 4299; 1 Pasch. Dig., arts. 5012, 5013, 5014.
The next objection to the deed as a recorded instrument is, that the certificate of the clerk does not state that he identified the person making the acknowledgment as the person who signed the deed.
The certificate does, in our opinion, identify May as personally known to the officer, and who then signed the instrument and acknowledged its execution, and delivered the same as the binding act of his principals, for the purposes, etc. The certificate, though not in technical form, substantially states the facts of a good acknowledgment, which authorized the deed’s registration.
Eeading the whole certificate, we do not think it is difficult, as claimed by plaintiffs, to determine who appeared before the officer to acknowledge the deed, in what capacity, and whose act it was, and for whom.
It is contended by plaintiffs, that a forged deed, or a deed under a forged power of attorney, will not support the plea of limitation.
This is true as to the five years statute of limitations, as expressly provided by statute (Devised Statutes, article 3193), but the statute does not reach the case under the plea of ten years limitation. It seems reasonable, that as the statute specially refers'to the bar by five years limitation without including the ten years limitation, it was intended to exclude the claim by the ten years, and that the statutory rule would not apply to the latter.
It must be borne in mind, that the deed by the agent is not impeached; it is only the power under which it was executed; and that this power was. not in evidence, presumably because it could not be proved as at common law, it having been lost and the record of it having been destroyed by fire, as stated in the abstract of title furnished by defendants upon demand of plaintiffs. The power is not shown to be a forgery, but only attacked as such, and if it were tendered in evidence, the burden'of proving its execution would be upon the defendants.
It was not offered in evidence; it was abandoned, without attempt to prove its genuineness.
The deed itself is not in the same condition; it is not impeached by affidavit; it is what it purports to be—a deed by May as agent to Elkins. It does not convey title had it been in May’s principals, but it is on its face a deed, containing all the elements of a valid deed tested by itself,, and we think may be the basis of- limitation by the ten years statute. The deed was duly acknowledged and duly recorded. Assuming that there was no power in the agent to make the conveyance, his act was a deed.
In Wofford v. McKinna, 23 Texas, 44, where it was held that a void tax deed could be used as predicate of limitation, the question of necessity of a power was discussed; it is said: <{ It does not follow that it [a deed] is not a deed because the power of the agent is not produced.”
It was held in Charle v. Saffold, 13 Texas, 109, 110, that a void will duly probated would furnish predicate for the ten years statute. We can not see that the absence of the power in this case can extend further than the mere fact that there is no power, and that the fact will not affect the deed as such under the ten years statute, to the extent of the boundaries as described therein. Bev. Stats., art. 3195; Lambert v. Weir, 27 Texas, 359; Jones v. Menard, 1 Texas, 771.
The deeds from Elkins to Erath and from Erath to Dibrell described the land conveyed to Dibrell; and there being no doubt as to the possession for ten years as alleged by the defendants, the jury, under a proper charge of the court, could not have done otherwise than find for defendants on their pleas of ten years limitation.
If we are correct in our conclusion, that defendants could base limitation upon the deed from May to Elkins, the court, under the testimony, should have directed the jury to find for defendants on the pleas of the statute of ten years limitation.
This being established, it becomes unnecessary to examine the rulings of the court upon the introduction of the deed from Elkins to Erath and from him to Dibrell; objected to upon the same grounds as the deed from May to Elkins; or the charges of the court upon the five years statute, or any other rulings not before disposed of.
We are of opinion that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.
Affirmed.
Delivered February 22, 1893."
216229,H. C. Cross and George A. Eddy v. McFaden & Logan,1892-11-09,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
The following agreement, entered into by the parties to this appeal, presents the questions involved in this cause:
“ 1. On May 26, 1890, J. N. McFaden and G-. W. Logan, who composed the copartnership of McFaden & Logan, applied to the local station agent of H. C. Cross and George A. Eddy, receivers of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway, at Taylor Station, in Williamson County, Texas, for cars to be in readiness at that place on May 30, 1890, in which to ship on that date 85 head of beef cattle to the Chicago market. The said station agent received the application, and promis* if cars could be gotten, to have them in readiness at said station on said date for the shipment of said cattle.
“ 2. Between 10 a. m. and 12 m. of said May 30, McFaden & Logan tendered to the said receivers’ agent at said Taylor Station the said 85 head of cattle to be received and transported by them to Chicago, and at that time the said cars, which had been ordered on said May 26, were in the yards at said station and in readiness to be used for such purpose. The agent refused to receive said cattle for shipment, when tendered as aforesaid, until other cattle in the pens and yard awaiting shipment could be loaded out.
“ 3. Late in the evening the cattle were penned, and thereafter kept in the ¡lens for about twenty-four hours before being shipped out, whereby, and by reason of injuries received en route, and a decline in the market, the cattle were damaged in the amount of the judgment — $343.
“ 4, The reason the said cattle were not received by said agent on said May 30th, and shipped out on that date, was an unusual and unprecedented rush of transit and local cattle at said Taylor Station on said day, which transit cattle had been received from connecting lines and local cattle from shippers at a date subsequent to May 26, the day when the cars were ordered as aforesaid. The said receivers had, on the occasion of the unprecedented rush, ample facilities for handling the ordinary cattle traffic at said station, and plaintiffs’ cattle could have been shipped out when tendered had they been given precedence over the other cattle.
“It is agreed between the parties hereto, acting through their respective counsel, that the only question for decision is:
“Is a common carrier, who agrees to furnish at a certain time and place, if they can be gotten, cars for the transportation of live stock, and who has on hand at the time and place specified the cars applied for, relieved from liability for damage from delay in the shipment of the live stock after tender of same by the party making application, because of an unusual and unprecedented accumulation of live stock at said time and place, received in transitu from connecting carriers and local shippers; all of said live stock being received after the day upon which the application for cars was made, and some after the live stock of the party so applying had been tendered for shipment ? In other words, has the common carrier the legal right to give precedence of shipment to the live stock received as aforesaid from connecting carriers and local shippers over the stock tendered by the shipper who has applied for cars to take his stock out on a day certain, without being liable to such shipper for resulting damage ?”
These facts show a contract between the parties, wherein the carrier agreed to furnish cars, if they could be procured, at a certain time and place, to be used by the shipper in transporting his cattle to the Chicago market. The shipper ajfeed to deliver the cattle for shipment at the time and place agreed oh.
The facts show that the cattle were delivered and presented for shipment at the time and place agreed on, and that cars were on hand that could have been used for the purpose of shipping said cattle; but the agent of appellants refused to receive and ship the'cattle at the time agreed on, because the cars were being used for the purpose of shipping other live stock.
Delivered November 9, 1892.
We know of no law that prohibits the making of contracts such as this; and when entered into they are to be governed by the ordinary and general rules of construction that relate to contracts and the breaches thereof.
In the absence of this contract the defense and excuse presented by appellants for failing to promptly ship the cattle would ordinarily excuse the carrier from liability. But such is not the case here, as the rights of the parties rest upon the contract. And for a breach of the contract by the carrier, it is as much liable as for other violated engagements that it is permitted to enter into.
The cars being on hand, the carrier should have performed its engagement; and for its refusal to so do, it is liable for the damages resulting from such breach of the contract. Railway v. Nicholson, 61 Texas, 495; Railway v. McCorquodale, 71 Texas, 46.
The judgment of the court below is affirmed.
Affirmed."
219211,"Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. J. W. Wright",1893-02-22,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
This is a suit by appellee against appellant, for damages resulting to his wife when a passenger on the cars of defendant’s railway. It is alleged, that on the 21st day of December, 1887, the wife of appellee purchased a coupon ticket over the line of-appellant’s road from Lampasas, Texas, via Wolfe City, Texas, to Montgomery, Alabama, and return. That upon her return trip, and while the ticket was in force, and while she was a passenger by virtue thereof upon appellant’s road between Temple and Lampasas, Texas, the conductor of appellant’s road would not accept the ticket for her passage, but demanded an additional fare from Temple to Lampasas, and that in his demand he acted arbitrarily, rudely, and harshly, and attempted to eject her from the train at Belton, Texas, and in order to prevent it she paid the extra fare demanded. This is denied by appellant; and it further alleges, that the time in which the ticket could be used had expired, and that it rightfully demanded the extra fare. Verdict and judgment in favor of appellee for $2082.25.
The ticket embodies the following conditions:
“Issued by Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway. Excursion ticket. Good for one first class passage to point between punch marks on Louisville & Nashville Railroad and return, when officially stamped on back hereof, and presented with coupon attached, subject to the following contract: In consideration of the reduced rates at which this ticket is sold, it is expressly agreed between the purchaser and the railroad companies over whose lines this ticket reads, as follows:
“ First. That in selling this ticket the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company acts as an agent, and is not responsible beyond its own line.
“Second. That this ticket is not transferable, and no stop-over at any intermediate point will be allowed unless specially provided for by the local regulations of- the lines over which it reads.
“ Third. That any alteration whatever of this ticket renders it void.
“ Fourth. That it is good for going passage only three days from date of sale, as stamped on the back hereof and written below.
“ Fifth. That it is not good for return passage unless the holder identifies himself as the original purchaser to the satisfaction of the authorized agent of the Louisville &.Nashville Railroad at Montgomery, on or before January 20, 1888; and when officially signed and dated in ink, and duly stamped on back hereof by said agent, this ticket shall"" then be good only three days after such date.
“ Sixth. That I, the original purchaser, hereby agree to sign my name and otherwise identify myself as such whenever called upon to do so by any conductor or agent of the line or lines over which the ticket reads.
“ Seventh. That baggage liability is limited to wearing apparel, not exceeding $100 in value.
“ Eighth. That the coupons belonging to this ticket will not be received for passage if detached.
‘ ‘ Ninth. That my signature must be in manuscript and ink.
“ Tenth. That unless all the conditions of this ticket are fully complied with it shall be void.
“ Eleventh. That I will not hold any of the lines named in this ticket liable for damages on account of any statement not in"" accordance with this contract, made by any employe of said lines.
‘ ‘ Twelfth. And it is specially agreed and understood by me, that no agent or employe of any of the lines named in this ticket has any power to alter, modify, or waive in any manner any of the conditions named in this contract.
“ Mrs. J. W. Wright, Purchaser.
“ C. L. Moody, Agent.”
Attached to and following the above were the coupons for passage, there being but one unused at time of the attempted ejection of plaintiff’s wife from the cars of defendant, and this coupon called for passage from Wolfe City to Lampasas.
It appears from the evidence, that at the time the ticket was presented and refused by the conductor, the wife of appellee was on her return trip, and that more than three days had expired after it was officially signed and stamped at Montgomery, Alabama, by the agent.
1. The appellant complains of the following charge given by the court:
“ Now, if you find from the evidence that plaintiff’s wife presented said ticket to defendant’s agent after the 18th day of January, 1888, then you are instructed, that said ticket was invalid, and defendant’s agent was justified in demanding payment of fare from Temple to Lampasas, and upon failure to pay such fare, the agent would be justified in ejecting the holder of such ticket from the car, unless you further believe from the evidence that the defendant, or some one or more of said connecting lines, caused the delay and failure of Mrs. Wright to present her ticket within the three days limitation.”
In view of the express agreement between the parties, wherein it was stipulated that the appellant was not liable beyond its own lines, we must hold this charge erroneous. It makes the appellant liable for delays occurring on lines of road other than its own. The rule is well settled in this State, that the liability of the carrier by contract can be limited and confined to its line of road. In cases of this kind, we believe the correct rule to be, that the carrier has the right to limit its liability to its own line, but when it undertakes to sell a ticket to be used within a certain time, it must see that the time agreed upon is reasonable from the standpoint of the then existing circumstances and conditions, and that the passenger, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, may perform and complete his journey within the time agreed. A time fixed in which the ticket may be used, less than is sufficient to accomplish that purpose, would be a limitation of time imposed which could not be reasonable under the circumstances. Agreements of this character are permitted by the law upon the theory that they are reasonable. The carrier selling the ticket must know of the movements of the trains and their connections over the lines of road that it sells, and the difficulties naturally and usually resulting in travel over those lines. This is necessarily so in determining if the time in which the passage is limited is reasonable. Whether the time in which a ticket is to be used is reasonable, is ascertained from all the facts and circumstances existing at the time the contract was made and the time the ticket should be used.
From these facts the jury must determine whether the limitation imposed was reasonable, and if the journey could, by ordinary diligence upon the part of the passenger, be accomplished within that period. In submitting the question to the jury, as to the liability of appellant for failure of the wife of appellee to reach the line of appellant’s road before the ticket expired, it should be in connection with a proper rule of law submitting to them the right to ascertain if, from the facts and circumstances, the time agreed upon was not reasonably sufficient for that purpose. If from the facts and circumstances existing at the time the contract of carriage was entered into, as to the connections and movements of the trains over the several lines of road, and reasonable changes that were likely to be made in the schedules of the movements of trains, and from the natural and usual difficulties that are likely to be inet by a traveller over the route, and that are of such a character that the carrier selling the ticket is likely to contemplate, the time agreed upon is not sufficient to accomplish the journey, it can then be said that the limitation imposed is unreasonable. 2 Woods Ry. Law, 1403, 1406.
2. The appellee was permitted to testify, over the objection of the appellant, as to statements and representations made by the ticket agent of appellant when the ticket was purchased, as to the movement of trains over the route covered by the ticket, and the advice of such agent to purchase the ticket over those lines. We think this evidence was properly admitted. 2 Wood’s Ry. Law, 1395; Burham v. Railway, 63 Me., 298; Van Kirk v. Railway, 76 Pa. St., 66.
This fact was not necessary to be pleaded in order to admit the evidence. It was admissible in showing the knowledge of appellant as to the proper route to be travelled and as to the movements of the trains. While it is true the passenger should know of the movements of the trains over his intended line of travel, he is only required to obtain his information from some source that he can rely upon. We know of no more reliable source of information than the road that sells the ticket. .All this testimony was admissible upon the question as to whether the appellant had the opportunity to know if the time agreed upon in which the ticket should be used was unreasonable, and was further admissible in showing diligence upon the part of the purchaser of the ticket in ascertaining the movements of trains over the line called for by the ticket.
3. The court did not err in refusing to give the special charge number 3 requested by appellant, to the effect, that “as between the conductor and the passenger, the ticket was the only evidence of the right of the passenger to ride, and that the conductor was not required to enter into an investigation as to failure to present the ticket upon defendant’s line before its limitation had expired.”
The passenger, when called upon for the extra fare, stated the reasons why she did not present the ticket before the three days expired in which it could be used. The effect of her statements tended to show, that she had used due diligence in her return trip, and that the time limited in the ticket was not sufficient for her to accomplish the journey. She had a right to rely upon the contract, and if from the facts and circumstances the time limited by the terms of the ticket for her to make the return trip was not a reasonable time for such purpose, the law would imply as one of the conditions of the contract that she should have a reasonable time in which to make and conclude the journey. This was a matter to be determined by the jury. She had the right to state the facts as she understood they were, and insist that her rights should be controlled by the contract as existed between her and appellant. She was under no obligation to pay another agent of appellant á sum in excess of that agreed upon with appellant as the amount stipulated for her transportation. When she stated to the conductor the facts tending to show that the time agreed upon was not reasonable, it was equivalent to an explanation made to appellant, and the appellant could no more justify the conduct of the conductor in exacting additional fare than it could a like exaction directly made by it. If in such a case the passenger should be right, the carrier can not exact the performance of conditions contrary to the rights of the passenger under the contract. It assumes the responsibility of any wrong it or its servants in authority may commit under the circumstances. Railway v. Martino, 18 S. W. Rep., 1068; Railway v. Mackie, 71 Texas, 494; Railway v. Bray, 25 N. E. Rep., 439; 125 Ind., 229; Wightman v. Railway, 40 N. W. Rep., 691; Head v. Railway, 7 S. E. Rep., 217; Railway v. Bamberg, 16 Atl. Rep., 67.
4. In answer to the objection made to the charge, the appellee contends that if error was committed, it was abstract; because the ticket should be so construed that the passenger was only required to commence her journey within the three days after the ticket was officially signed and stamped, and was not required to complete it within that time, as the facts indisputably show that she did commence the journey within the three days.
The court below, we think, correctly construed this clause in the ticket to mean that the journey should be completed within the three days. If we understand it, this was the effect given to the ticket by the court below. This construction is correct, unless the time stated in the ticket may be controlled or extended by facts showing that it was not a reasonable time in which to accomplish the journey. Railway v. Looney, 85 Texas, 158.
The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered February 22, 1893."
216233,Josephine Medlin et al. v. John Wilkens et al.,1892-11-16,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
July 18,1868, appellants sued the appellees in trespass to try title. September 3,1888, the appellants amended their petition, upon which the case was tried.
The amended petition described the land sued for as “ One suerte of land in the city of San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas, known as the Maria Gertrudes de Torres suerte, bounded on the north by Thomas Martinez suerte, west by the Acequia Madre, south by the Fuentes suerte, and east by what was known at the time of the original grant as vacant land, and having a front of about 120 varas on said Acequia Madre, and running back 440 varas to said vacant lands, and being fully described in the plat made by G-. Friesleben, and made a part of the report of C. Hart-nett, surveyor herein; said property having been, without consent of petitioners, subdivided into lots and streets and alleys, as shown by said plat, as follows: Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, between Water Street on the west and Second Street on the east, bounded south by North Street and north by the north line of the suerte; lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, bounded west by Second Street, south by North Street, east by Third Street, and north by the north line of suerte; lots 1, 2, 3, 4, bounded west by Third Street, south by North Street, east by east line of suerte, and north by north line of the suerte; lots 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, bounded west by Water Street, south by an alley, east by Second Street, and north by North Street; lots 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16,15, bounded west by Second Street, south by alley, east by Third Street, north by North Street; lots 14, 13, 12, bounded west by Third Street, south by alley, east by east boundary line of this suerte, and north by North Street; and also a tier of fractional lots, bounded' west by Water Street, south by said Fuentes suerte, and east by east line of this suerte, and north by said alley; said tier of fractional lots crossing Second and Third streets. Said lots and streets comprising said Maria Gertrudes Torres suerte.”
The petition also alleged that plaintiffs and defendants claimed the land from Philip Dimmitt as common source.
Defendants plead not guilty, and the three, five, and ten years statutes of limitations; also deny that they are in possession of the land described in plaintiffs’ petition as the Maria Gertrudes de Torres suerte, and allege that they are in possession of the Ramon de la Fuentes suerte, of which the land sued for is a part; deny any title of plaintiffs in the land, and say that Philip Dimmitt is not common source.
The plaintiffs, in replication to the pleas of limitations, plead minority and coverture.
Verdict and judgment were rendered in favor of defendants.
Findings of Fact. — 1. That the plaintiffs are the heirs at law of Philip Dimmitt and his wife. Philip Dimmitt died in 1841, and his wife in 1855.
2. From admission made at a former trial of this case and from recitals in deeds, it is evident that the Torres suerte and the Fuentes suerte formerly belonged to Philip Dimmitt.
3. No written conveyance was shown by defendants, passing title out of Philip Dimmitt and wife.
4. From the entire range of facts, the evidence is not sufficient to entitle the defendants to recover and hold all of the land by limitation.
5. The plaintiffs failed to show by evidence that the defendants were in possession of the Torres suerte, the land sued for; but, upon the contrary, the evidence in the record shows that these defendants and Beck, under whom they claim, asserted title to the Fuentes suerte, and that they were in possession of land within the boundaries of said suerte, and not in possession or claiming land within the Torres suerte.
Delivered November 16, 1892.
This being an ordinary action of trespass to try title, and the plaintiffs claiming title to the Maria Gertrudes de Torres suerte, and alleging a trespass by defendants upon that survey, and the defendants having denied that they were in possession of that suerte, but were in possession of the Fuentes suerte, the burden was upon the plaintiffs to prove that defendants were in possession of the land sued for and described in their petition. Having failed to do this, but, upon the contrary, the evidence showing that the defendants were within .the bounds of the Fuentes suerte, and not within the limits of the Torres suerte, the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover.
The fact that Philip Dimmitt was formerly the o.wner of the Torres and Fuentes suertes, and may be regarded as the common source of title, would not relieve the plaintiffs from proving possession by defendants of the land sued for and described in their petition, when such possession is expressly denied.
Plaintiffs will not be permitted to sue for one tract of land and recover another not described and mentioned in their petition.
The evidence of witness Semlieges, as complained of in appellants’’ third assignment of error, was admissible, not upon the ground that plaintiffs were bound by the testimony of the deceased witness Paschal as given on the former trial, but upon the ground that Paschal’s statement as to what was said and done by Rodriguez when he pointed out the lines of the Fuentes suerte was admissible, it appearing that Rodriguez was dead when Paschal testified, and that he had known the lines of the suerte since 1825, the boundaries of the land being ancient when he pointed it out to Paschal.
This disposition that we make of the case relieves us of the necessity of passing upon all the questions raised by the various assignments of error.
The reading of a portion of their answer by appellees to the jury, as complained of in appellants’ sixteenth assignment of error, was in explanation of certain parts of the answer that were read by the appellants to the jury.
We think it was error for the appellants, in the first instance, to read abandoned pleadings as evidence to prove a fact material; but when they did so, it was permissible for the appellees to introduce other parts of the answer that explained that so read.
The judgment of the court below is affirmed.
Affirmed."
216257,R. A. Flannagan v. J. R. Nasworthy et al.,1892-11-16,"KEY, Associate Justice.
This is an action of trespass to try title, brought by appellees J. R. Nasworthy and the San Angelo National Bank, against appellant, R. A. Flannagan, to recover section 182 of the public free school lands, located by virtue of Washington County Railroad scrip.
Appellees claim the land by virtue of a sale made to said Nasworthy in January, 1884, at Austin, Texas, by the Land Board; appellee the San Angelo National Bank claiming a one-half undivided interest by mesne conveyance from said Nasworthy.
Appellant pleaded not guilty, and in reconvention for damages for the wrongful and malicious suing out of a writ of sequestration.
There was judgment for appellees for the land, and that appellant was not entitled to recover damages.
It is contended that there was error in admitting in evidence the appointment in writing of J. T. Talbot as substitute trustee to sell an undivided interest in the land in controversy to pay a debt due the San Angelo National Bank, said appointment purporting to be for and in behalf of said bank, by M. B. Pulliam, as president, it not being made to appear by evidence that Pulliam, as president, was authorized to make such appointment either by the board of directors or the rules, regulations, or charter of the bank, nor that the board of directors had ever ratified said appointment.
It appears that one Upton once owned an undivided half-interest in the land, and executed a deed of trust thereon to secure a debt to the San Angelo National Bank, in which William E. Ellis was named as trustee. This deed of trust provided that in the event of the failure of Ellis to act as trustee the bank might appoint a substitute. Ellis died, and M. B. Pulliam, signing his name as president, appointed J. T. Talbot as substitute trustee, who sold the land under the deed of trust, and at the sale the bank became the purchaser.
We deem it unnecessary to determine whether or not the appointment of Talbot as substitute trustee was the action of the bank or of Pulliam only; because if the bank, as purchaser at the sale made by Talbot, acquired no title, then appellee Nasworthy is a tenant in common with-Upton, and, as against appellant, is entitled to recover if he has acquired title to the land through his purchase from the State.
Appellant contends that appellees’ title to the land in controversy is fatally defective:
1. Because there was no classification of the school lands in Tom Green County, as required by the Act of April 12, 1883.
2. Because the land was not sold in the county where it was situated, as required by said act.
3. Because Nasworthy did not correctly describe the land in his application to purchase, as required by the rules and regulations of the Land Board.
It was shown that the school lands of Tom Green County were not classified under the Act of April 12, 1883; but the order of the Commissioners Court of said county approving the appraisement of these lands by the county surveyor, under the law of 1881, if adopted by the Land Board as a basis for its action, was perhaps a sufficient compliance with the third section of the Act of April 12, 1883, in reference to the classification of school lands. But the sale of the land in question by the Land Board at Austin, Texas, instead of in the county where the land was situated, was in violation of the sixth section of said act; and for this reason, in the absence of curative legislation, the sale of the land to Nasworthy by the Land Board was void and conferred no title. Martin v. McCarty, 74 Texas, 128; The State v. Opperman, 74 Texas, 136.
The case of Martin v. McCarty was decided in December, 1888, and the Twenty-first Legislature, which met in January following, passed an act validating certain acts of the Land Board. This last act was approved March 12, 1889 (page 106, Laws of 1889), and in so far as it applies to this case, reads as follows:
“ Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That all contracts made by the Land Board of the State of Texas for the sale of the free school, university, and asylum lands >under the Act of April 12, 1883, to any person who has in good faith made such purchase, and in good faith has complied with the requirements of said act, the rules and regulations of the State Land Board, and the terms and conditions of his said contract, shall be and are hereby made valid and binding upon the State in the same manner as if the said Land Board had in all particulars complied with the requirements of the said law.”
The appellees contend, that whatever irregularities or omissions there may have been in the proceedings of the Land Board in the sale of the land involved, the same are cured and the sale of the land validated by this act.
We concur in this construction to the extent of holding, that if the healing act referred to is not unconstitutional, the purchase of the land in controversy by Nasworthy was validated, if he in good faith complied with the Act of April 12, 1883, the terms of his contract, and the rules and regulations of the Land Board.
We doubt not that the decision in the case of Martin v. McCarty, already referred to, affecting as it probably did many purchases that had been made from the Land Board, was the reason impelling the Legislature to pass the act in question.
It is contended, however, by appellant, that the validating Act of March 12, 1889, is forbidden by section 4, article 7, of our State Constitution, which declares that the Legislature shall have no power to grant any relief to purchasers of lands set apart to the public free school fund.
Our Supreme Court has construed this provision of the Constitution in the case of Barker v. Torrey, 69 Texas, 7, in which an act of the Legislature, as much in the nature of 1 ‘ relief ’ ’ as the one now under consideration, was involved.
In that case the Act of February 16, 1885, extending the time of forfeiture of the land for nonpayment of interest from March to August, was held to be valid, and not in contravention of the Constitution; and in the opinion it is said: “Notwithstanding that statute, the obligation of the purchaser to pay both principal and interest in strict accordance with his contract and the law under which it was made, continued; and the State, like any other creditor, could enforce all rights and claims which would ordinarily legally grow out of the fact that the interest was not paid on the very day it became due and payable. The statute did not release the purchaser from any obligation arising from the contract or its breach. The effect of the statute was, while leaving the purchaser fully bound, to suspend the right which the State had to cancel the contract and thus to forfeit the right of the purchaser to have the executory contract carried out if the annual interest was not paid on or before the first day of March.”
The Legislature being clothed with the power to create the Land Board, and to authorize it to make rules and regulations for the sale of the school lands, thereby making the board the agent of the State to sell the lands, it also had the power to ratify the acts of its agent done contrary to or in excess of the authority conferred.' The board in making the sale of the land was accomplishing the very purpose for which it was created; and the Legislature having created the agent, and being satisfied with its acts and the results accomplished, had the power to sanction and approve such acts and legalize the contract entered into between the purchaser and the State through such agent; though the agent had, in the manner of making the contract, departed from certain mandatory provisions of the law creating the agency. And such approval and ratification, when it does not relieve the purchaser from any of the obligations resting upon him, is not so clearly “relief,” as this term is used in the Constitution, as would authorize us to hold that the act in question is forbidden by the constitutional provision above referred to.
The third objection to appellees’ title involves the main question in the case. Recognizing that the law cast upon them the burden of showing the facts which would bring Nasworthy’s purchase within the class of contracts referred to and validated by the healing act above quoted, appellees put in evidence the following rules of the Land Board, of date October 23, 1883:
“ Resolved by the board, that all common school, university, and asylum lands in all the counties of the State are hereby placed upon the market for sale or lease.
“ Resolved, that under authority of section 7 of chapter 88, General Laws of 1883, the following is prescribed as the mode of placing said lands on the market: The application for purchase * * * of any of said lands shall be in writing and addressed to the secretary of the Land Board at Austin, Texas; said application shall fully and minutely describe each and every section desired to be bought, * * * giving number of section, block, and certificate, and name of original grantee, with character of soil, grass, timber, and water, if any, on each section; * * * the price per acre offered for the purchase. * * *' The application must be sworn to before some officer authorized to administer oaths, and the * * * sale will be regarded as vacated and null for misrepresentation or false description. * * * The application will be forwarded by the applicant to the Land Board at Austin. * * * And the same will be considered by the board on the first Tuesday of the following month.”
The appellees also introduced the application of J. R. Nasworthy to purchase the land in controversy, as follows:
“San Angelo, Texas, December 23, 1883.
“ To the Secretary of the Land Board, Austin, Texas:
“ Under and by virtue of the provisions of an act to provide for the classification, sale, * * * of the common school lands, approved April 12,1883, and the resolutions of the honorable Land Board, adopted October 23, 1883, * * * I hereby apply for the purpose of purchasing the following lands surveyed and set apart for the public school fund (which said land is represented on accompanying sketch), situated in Tom Green County, Texas:
“ Respectfully,
“J. R. Naswobthy.”
Which application was properly sworn to, filed with the county surveyor of Tom Green, and forwarded to the secretary of the Land Board at Austin, and there filed as by law required; and it was admitted by the appellant that section 182, the same being the land in controversy, was by the State Land Board, at its first meeting in January, 1884, awarded to J. R. Nasworthy, and that all payments of principal and interest thereon required by law had been paid to date; and that Nasworthy properly executed his note for payment of the residue of the purchase money.
Appellant objected to the introduction of all this testimony, and also to the evidence of Tarver, the county surveyor of Tom Green County, tending to show that the Commissioner of the Land Office, prior to Nasworthy’s application to purchase, had authorized him to sell the school lands in that county, under the Act of 1881; appellant contending, among other things, that, without a classification in conformity with the last named act, the Land Board had no authority to sell the land; and as to the application to purchase, that it did not conform to the rules and regulations of said board, in that it did not correctly describe the land sought to be purchased.
We think this testimony, as well as the evidence introduced by appellees showing that in 1883 and 1884 the land in suit was used for pasturage, which was objected to by appellant, was admissible. To exclude the application to purchase and the award of the Land Board showing Nasworthy’s purchase, because there was no sufficient classification of the land, even if such was the fact, or because the sale was not made at the place required by the Act of April 12, 1883, would be to deny to appellees the right to show that Nasworthy’s purchase is such as was intended to be validated by the Act of March 12, 1889.
Whether or not the description of the land given in the application to purchase was in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Land Board, was a question of fact to be determined by the jury, and not one of law to be decided by the court.
The purpose for which the land was used was admissible, to aid the jury in determining the character of the land — whether agricultural or pasture — and the good or bad faith of Nasworthy in describing it as “ fit for pasture only.”
Appellant’s theory, as gathered from his brief, appears to be, that in order for a purchaser of school or other lands to be protected under the Act of March 12, 1889, he must show, among other things, a strict compliance with all the rules and regulations of the Land Board; and it is contended that the purchase in this case falls short of such compliance, in this, that Nasworthy’s application does not give the number of the block of which the survey in question is a part, and that the description of the soil is not restricted to the survey in controversy, but applies equally to two other surveys, sought to be purchased at the same time. It is also contended that the testimony shows that the description of the land as suitable only for pasture was untrue, the contention being that at the time the application to purchase was made it was agricultural land.
Without expressing any opinion upon the weight of testimony, we believe that the court below correctly interpreted the statute in question when it instructed the jury that if Nasworthy had reasonable ground to believe, and did believe, that the description of the land contained in his application to purchase was true, then he acted in good faith. If prior to the Act of March 12, 1889, in litigation between the State and Nasworthy, a question of fraud in the description given in his application to purchase had arisen, and it had been shown that, after exercising Ordinary care and diligence to ascertain the facts, Nasworthy had described the land in some respects inaccurately, but as he honestly believed was proper and correct, we believe that his title would have been upheld. In our opinion, the healing act in question was intended to apply to and protect such cases as the one just stated, as well as those where the purchaser had strictly complied with all requirements.
If to obtain the benefits of that act the purchaser must show a strict compliance on his part with the law of 1883, the rules and regulations of the Land Board, and his contract, then, what did the Legislature mean by the words “in good faith,” used twice in the same line of the healing Act of 1889 ? If he had rigidly complied with the law, the rules and regulations of the Land Board, and his contract of purchase, how could his acts be otherwise than in good faith ? If one party to a contract does all that both the spirit and letter of the law, the obligations of his contract, and the rules prescribed by the other party thereto require of him, he certainly is not chargeable with bad faith.
The words “ good faith,” as used in this law, can and should be given a meaning.
They signify that the State will shield and protect the honest purchaser of its territory, though he may have made a mistake in the description given thereof; but that he who has attempted to defraud the State through a willful misdescription shall not become a beneficiary of the law in question. When a strict compliance with all requirements is shown, good faith is presumed; but when the rules of the Land Board are not rigidly complied with, the question of good or bad faith becomes one of intent. To impose upon the purchaser of land from the State the burden of showing absolute accuracy of description of the land applied for, especially as regards the purposes for which it may be utilized, would introduce into his title an element of uncertainty, as well as possible injustice, which we do not believe was intended by the Legislature or the Land Board.
In fact, neither the statute nor the rules of the Land Board require the purchaser to state in his application to purchase the purposes for which the land is suitable; but as Nasworthy described the land as suitable for pasture only, and the rules of the board declared that misrepresentation or false description should result in a forfeiture of the land, the uses for which the land was suitable became an issue in the case.
But the same rules of law apply to this description that do to those that were required, and if Nasworthy was honestly mistaken his purchase is protected.
The history of our State, past and current, shows that its possibilities are such that the honest, purchaser of its soil ought not to be expected to penetrate the future, and with absolute certainty foretell the capabilities of the land he desires to purchase.
The time has been, within the memory of, many persons now living, when large portions of the territory of Texas now devoted to successful farming were considered, by almost everybody, as suitable for grazing purposes only.
Appellant complains of the action of the court in excluding testimony offered to show the depth of soil and productiveness of lands adjoining the section in controversy.
As to the proposed testimony in regard to the depth of soil on an adjoining survey, as disclosed by digging a shaft, the bill of exceptions does not state how near the shaft was to the land involved; and we, perhaps, would not reverse the case because of the exclusion of this testimony.
But as to the other testimony offered and excluded, the bill of exceptions shows that the witness would have testified, “that he had owned and cultivated five acres of ground for several years, adjoining the land in controversy on the south; that the soil on said five acres was like the thinnest and poorest on the land in controversy, and that said five acres produced well the agricultural products of this country, without irrigation.”
Next to the cultivation of the land in controversy, it occurs to us that the cultivation of similar land in the same vicinity would be one of the most satisfactory methods of determining the productive qualities of the land involved. When such questions as value or fitness for a particular use are involved, it is often permissible to use evidence which will enable the jury to draw conclusions by comparisons. 7 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 60.
The excluded testimony, if true, would have afforded a test exceedingly fair to appellees. The small tract cultivated was separated from this land only by an imaginary line, and its soil was similar to the “ thinnest and poorest ’ ’ on said land. This testimony tended to show that the soil on the land in suit was productive; a fact which appellees sought, by showing the character and depth of soil, to negative.
Of course, if this fact had been shown, it would not have conclusively proved that the land involved was agricultural land when Nasworthy made his application to purchase, because it requires sufficient and timely rains, as well as productive soil, to make agrieutural land. But the excluded testimony tended to show that the land was suitable for agricultural purposes.
It is true, as appellees contend, that if it had been shown that this land was agricultural land in 1883 and 1884, still it would not necessarily follow that Nasworthy had not acted in good faith in describing it as suitable for pasture only. He may have honestly thought so and been mistaken.
But the excluded testimony was admissible, because its tendency was to prove a material fact, proper to have been considered by the jury in determining the main fact.
The excluded evidence offered to prove that the year 1883 was a seasonable year was also admissible; but as that fact was proved by other witnesses, and not controverted, the error is harmless.
The charge of the court, as well as its refusal to give certain special charges asked by appellant, is complained of. The assignment of errólas to the charges refused is too general; but as the case will be reversed, we have examined these charges and the charge given.
There is one omission in the court’s charge, and one statement in it ought to have been omitted.
On all questions involving appellees’ title to the land the burden rested upon them; the charge given was silent on this subject, and the special charges asked by appellant were sufficient to direct the attention of the court to the omission. After correctly telling the jury what the issue for their determination on the question of title was, and submitting that issue to them, the court charged as follows:
“And in this connection, you are instructed that the question is not - whether the land in question is agricultural or pasture land, or was at-the time Nasworthy made his application to purchase same,’ ’ etc.
While it is true that this was not the controlling issue in the case, yet it was a subordinate question, pertinent to the main issue. If the land was shown to be agricultural land, especially if it was such at the time Nasworthy made his application to purchase, it was important testimony in behalf of appellant. If it was not agricultural land, that fact was very important to appellees. It is ordinarily sufficient for the charge of the court to inform the jury what the issues for their determination are, without attempting to explain what are not issues. Such attempts are often calculated to impress the jury with the belief that the court entertains certain views as to the weight of important testimony. Such was the tendency of the charge in question, and it should not have been given.
We have examined the case of Nobles v. Cattle Company, 69 Texas, 434, cited by appellees, holding that, as against a purchaser of school land under the Act of April 12, 1883, no one but the State can raise the question of fraud. That case was tried and decided on appeal before the decision in Martin v. McCarty, and the purchaser was not attempting to avail himself of the benefit of a healing statute. If he had been guilty of fraud in obtaining the land from the State, that fact, as held in that case, only rendered his title voidable.
Delivered November 16, 1892.
But in the case at bar, it being necessary for appellees to avail themselves of the healing Act of March 12, 1889, the law casts upon them the burden of showing that Nasworthy had acted in good faith in all he did in reference to the contract of purchase under which appellees claim.
For this reason this case is distinguishable from the one just cited.
Because admissible testimony was excluded, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.
Chief Justice Fisher did not sit in this case."
219255,Holmes Ivory v. H. Kempner and W. H. Crafton,1893-03-02,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
The nature and result of this suit is thus given by appellant: This suit was brought by appellant to enjoin the sale, by the sheriff of Brazoria County, of several tracts of land attached in a suit instituted in Galveston County by Harris Kempner against E. N. Wilson, which last suit resulted in judgment for Kempner and a foreclosure of the attachment, and an order for the sale of the attached property.
W. H. Grafton intervened in the present suit, alleging that he wás surety for the debt upon which Kempner obtained his judgment, and that the judgment provided, that in case it was not satisfied out of the property of Wilson, levy should be made upon the property of Grafton.
The defendant and the intervenor in the injunction suit pleaded general and special demurrers, and prayed a dissolution of the injunction. They also set up facts which they claimed should prevent the injunction from being perpetuated.
The plaintiff moved to strike out the intervention; also filed a supplemental petition, in which he demurred generally and specially to the answer and intervention, and set up facts which, in connection with those in his original petition, he claimed entitled him to the injunction, notwithstanding the said answer and intervention. By consent, this supplemental petition was taken and treated as if it formed a part of the original petition for the purposes of the demurrers of the defendant and intervenor. The court overruled the motion to strike out the intervention, and sustained the demurrers of the defendant and intervenor. Thereupon the plaintiff, declining to amend, stood by his petitions as taken together, and judgment was rendered dismissing the suit, and for costs against the plaintiff and the sureties upon his injunction bond. From which judgment plaintiff and his sureties have appealed to this court.
To this statement it is proper to add, that appellants were not in possession of the lands covered by the mortgages set out in their original and supplemental petitions, and under and by virtue of which he sues to restrain the sale of the lands by appellee Kempner. Nor does either of the mortgages give the mortgagee the benefit of the rents and profits of the land. The appellant’s demurrer to the petition of the intervenor Grafton was, in our judgment, properly overruled. The intervenor Grafton is directly interested in the result of this suit. He was a defendant in the suit of Kempner, in which judgment was rendered against Wilson, and against himself as the surety of Wilson, the judgment directing the property of the surety to be protected from sale under execution until the property of defendant Wilson was sold. Grafton then is interested in the subject matter of litigation between the appellant and the appellee, and must be affected by the judgment rendered in this suit, and he should therefore be permitted to intervene. Pome, on Rem., sec. 429.
Besides their general exception, the defendant and intervenor presented several special exceptions to the original and supplemental petitions, which two petitions were by agreement, as recited in the judgment of the court, considered and treated as an amended original petition. The judgment upon the demurrers is general, and does not state which, if any, of the exceptions were overruled. We shall not, therefore, discuss the exceptions seriatim, but shall consider only the principal question presented by the record for our decision.
Were the averments of the petition sufficient, if true, to entitle the plaintiff to the remedy prayed for ? This question, we think, must be answered in the affirmative. It is conceded that ordinarily when an execution or order of sale is levied upon property of a defendant in execution, that the sale can hot be enjoined by a creditor of the defendant who holds a lien upon the property levied on, which is prior to the judgment. But while this is the general rule, it is well established that the sale will be enjoined when it would place a cloud upon the creditor’s title. As to what constitutes a cloud upon title may not be definitely settled, the decisions of the courts on the subject not being in entire harmony. But the Supreme Court of this State has held, that an injunction will be granted to restrain an execution sale when the evidence on which the right of the complainant depends is not of record, nor shown in the papers through which the right depends. Mann v. Wallis, Landes & Co., 75 Texas, 614; Van Ratcliff v. Call, 72 Texas, 492; Gardner v. Douglass, 64 Texas, 76. The appellant’s claim of right in the property attached and ordered sold by the judgment in the suit of appellee against E. N. Wilson is twofold; first, by subrogation to the right of the Texas Land and Loan Company, under their deed of trust executed in 1866, by virtue of the assignment of the notes secured by said deed of trust to one Smith, for the use and benefit of appellant; and second, by a deed of trust upon the same property, executed to appellant in June, 1888, by said E. N. Wilson and his wife Ella Wilson, to secure the loan of $25,000, and interest on same. Appellant in his petition avers, that without his authority and without his knowledge, the said Smith executed on the 16th of May, 1890, what purports to be a release of the mortgage executed iff 1886 for the benefit of the Texas Land and Loan Company, and that same is of record in the office of the clerk of the county in which the lands covered by the said mortgage are situated. He avers, that at the time of the execution of the mortgage by Wilson and wife to him in June, 1888, it was expressly agreed and stipulated between him and said mortgagors that said mortgage to said Texas Land and Loan Company should continue in force and operation for his benefit until the money loaned by him, and as security for which the mortgage of June, 1888, was executed, should be paid; and that in confirmation of this agreement, when the debt due the Said Land and Loan Company was finally settled and liquidated, which was done in part with the money loaned by him on June, 1888, to Wilson and wife, the notes secured by the mortgage of 1886 were-by said Land and Loan Company assigned and transferred to petitioner. And. he denies that Smith, to whom said notes were assigned as agent, and for his benefit, was his agent for releasing said mortgage of 1886; and that if said Smith did execute said paper of 16th of May, 1890, it was without authority from petitioner, and void as to him.
The petitioner further avers, that the said E. N. Wilson conveyed the. property covered by the mortgages to his wife, the said Ella, on the 14th of November, 1887, the deed therefor reciting that the consideration was $8000, the same being the separate money of the wife; that said deed was duly registered in the county in which the lands lie on the 16th of November, 1887; and that on the 23d of same month appellee attached said lands as the property of the said E. N. Wilson. The petitioner avers, that he had no knowledge of the existence of the suit of appellee H. Kempner against E. N. Wilson and the intervenor, W. H. Grafton, at the time he loaned his money and took the mortgage of June, 1888; and he denies all knowledge of the fraud in the sale and purchase of the lands between Wilson and his wife in November, 1887, charged against them by appellee and intervenor.
These averments, we think, show conclusively that the rights claimed by appellant in the attached property are not evidenced in whole by title of record, but are dependent in part upon alleged facts, which must be established by evidence dehors the record; and this being so, a sale under execution would place a cloud on appellant’s title. The sale should be enjoined until the relative rights of appellants and appellee shall be determined and adjudicated by decree of the court.
The judgment of the lower court, sustaining demurrers to plaintiff’s petition and dissolving the injunction and dismissing the suit, is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the law as announced in this opinion.

219126,N. K. Fairbanks & Co. v. Leon & H. Blum,1893-03-02,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
On the 19th day of March, 1891, Leon & H. Blum and others filed their petition in the District Court of Galveston County, complaining of 1ST. K. Fairbanks & Co., a corporation resident of the State of Illinois, in an action for damages growing out of the alleged wrongful sequestration of certain boxes of soap in Val Verde County, Texas, by which action plaintiffs were damaged in the sum of $1420.
On the 9th day of April appellant, by foreign counsel, filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the court, disclaiming the submission of itself to the jurisdiction of the court, and expressly denying the same, and showing that service had been had upon M. S. Ujffy, a resident of Galveston County, and denying the agency of the said Ujffy; denying further that it had any agent in Galveston County. This plea was properly verified.
On the 21st of May the court entered an order quashing the service, but reciting that the answer constituted an appearance, and ordering the defendant to plead to the next term of the court.
On the 18th of July judgment was rendered, without further service on defendant, in favor of plaintiffs for $1609.33, “as for their damages by reason of the matters set forth in plaintiffs’ petition.”
On July 20 appellant (defendant below) filed a motion to set aside the judgment; which motion being overruled, defendant excepted and brings the cause to this court on appeal.
The assignments of error present but two questions, which are:
First. Did the District Court, by the filing of the plea attacking the service, acquire jurisdiction over the person of appellant ?
Second. Could the District Court of Galveston County entertain a suit for damages for the levy of a sequestration in another county, when defendants were not residents ?
1. It is contended by counsel for appellants, that the decisions of our Supreme Court and of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of York v. The State and other like cases, do not reach the point here involved; and stress is laid in the argument upon the fact, that in the York case the defendant, after his plea to the jurisdiction had been overruled, demanded a jury, paid the fee, and had his cause placed upon the jury trial docket. But it appears from the opinion in that case, that neither the judgment of our Supreme Court nor that of the Supreme Court of the United States was based upon those facts. They clearly rest upon a construction of our statutes prescribing the effect to be given to the filing of an answer. This is illustrated by the following passages from the opinions of the two courts:
Chief Justice Stayton says: “Under the statutes of this State all defensive pleadings are styled the 1 answer,’ and among these are pleas questioning the jurisdiction of the court over the defendant. In view of this fact, and in the light of the statutes to which we have referred, it must be held, under article 1242, Revised Statutes, that a defendant who files any defensive pleadings makes such an appearance as gives the court jurisdiction over his person as fully as would the issuance of a proper citation and its proper service within this State. * * * The purpose for which the appearance is made is unimportant, as is the intention with which it is made, if the act done is one which the statute declares is such as gives the court jurisdiction to render a personal judgment against the person appearing.” 73 Texas, 657.
Justice Brewer thus interprets the decision just cited: “It was conceded by the District and Supreme Court, that the service upon the defendant in St. Louis was a nullity and gave the District Court no jurisdiction; but it was held, that under the peculiar statutes of Texas the appearance for the purpose of pleading to the jurisdiction was a voluntary appearance, which brought the defendant into court.” 137 IT. S., 15.
It thus incontestably appears that it was the filing of a plea to the jurisdiction, and not the subsequent acts of the defendant, that was held to constitute, under our present statute, an appearance for all purposes.
The quashing of the service upon the alleged agent in the present case did not destroy the effect of the answer which had been filed by appellant. That service was confessedly a nullity, as was that in the York case. It conferred upon the court no power over the defendant’s person, but that power came through the effect given by the statute to the defendant’ s voluntary act in pleading.
The order quashing the service can not be treated as an adjudication by the court that it had not by the answer acquired jurisdiction, nor as a relinquishment of its power over defendant’s person, for it expressly declared that the answer constituted an appearance, and continued the case until the next term of the court for an answer upon the merits.
The jurisdiction in such cases does not arise from the quashing of the service. A motion to quash which is sustained operates as an appearance to the next term. But an answer is also an appearance. It might be conceded that there was no motion to quash, in the sense of the statute; but there was an answer, which has equal if not greater effect.
Since the decision in the York case, a number of cases have been passed upon by our Supreme Court, adhering to the rule there laid down. Kauffman v. Wooters, 79 Texas, 205, and 138 U. S., 285; Railway v. Whitley, 77 Texas, 126; Sam v. Hockstadler Bros., 76 Texas, 162; Life Ins. Co. v. Hanna, 81 Texas, 487.
In the last case the pleading filed by the nonresident was, as in this case, an attack upon service on an alleged agent, denying the fact of agency. This was held to be an appearance. It is true the plea, or motion to quash, as it was called in that case, was overruled by the District Court. We can not see that there would be any difference, in the effect on jurisdiction, between the overruling the motion and the quashing of such a service, unless, perhaps, the court should adjudge that it had not acquired jurisdiction, and thereupon should dismiss the defendant. The power over the person of defendant attaches upon the answer, and not upon the order quashing or sustaining service.
After carefully considering the brief and argument of appellant’s counsel, we can not distinguish this case, in principle, from that of York v. The State and the others cited, and must hold, in obedience to the law as declared, that the plea filed by appellant conferred jurisdiction over its person upon the District Court.
2. Being in court, appellant was subject to the same rules of pleading as other litigants. If the law fixed the venue of this suit in Val Verde County, it had the privilege of being sued there; but it was a privilege which, to be made effectual, must have been claimed either by demurrer or plea. Not having filed either, appellant waived its right, and can not now be heard to complain. Statutes fixing venue do not generally affect jurisdiction, in its proper sense, but confer privileges, which are waived when not asserted. The State v. Snyder, 66 Texas, 687.
The judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed.

216286,J. T. Cunningham et al. v. San Saba County,1892-11-23,"KEY, Associate Justice.
This suit was instituted by appellants, as plaintiffs, on the 9th day of August, 1888, to recover damages against appellee, San Saba County, for an alleged unlawful appropriation of a strip of land for a public road, extending across a league and labor of land owned by appellants.
Appellee pleaded title by prescription, and the two years statute of limitations was pleaded as a bar to appellants’ claim for damages.
The appellants Mrs. S. A. Callahan and Mrs. Addie E. Leverett pleaded coverture in avoidance of the pleas of limitation and prescription, and appellant F. C. Cunningham pleaded minority for the same purpose.
The appellants J. T. Cunningham, A. C. Cunningham, Mrs. Addie E. Leverett, Mrs. S. A. ""Callahan, and Miss F. C. Cunningham inherited the tract ""of land across which the road in question runs from their father, who died on the 25th day of September, 1878, and who at the time of his death was insane, and had been in that condition for two or three years.
The testimony shows that the road in question has been traveled and used by the public across appellants’ land for between fifteen and twenty years prior to the death of their father, and it has been so used and traveled ever since that time, embracing a strip of land about 40 feet wide, and running diagonally across the entire tract, varying in width, however, in some places from 10 to 75 yards, where the road would get muddy.
There is no testimony showing affirmatively that the appellants knew of the existence of the road on their land until August, 1883; nor is it shown that San Saba County, or any one acting for it or in behalf of the public, ever claimed the exclusive right of the county or the public to use the strip of land in question as a public road until August, 1878.
It appears that in May, 1877, the Commissioners Court of San Saba County appointed a jury of view to establish a second class road from the town of San Saba to Chick’s Crossing, on the Colorado River. The jury reported on the 12th day of August, 1878, establishing the road, in so far as this case is concerned, upon the same ground across the appellants’ land as the road hereinbefore mentioned. Thereafter, and during the August term, 1878, of the Commissioners Court of said county, said court adopted the report of the jury of view, ordered the road to be opened, appointed an overseer for it, and apportioned hands to work the same. Such annual appointment of an overseer of the road and apportionment of hands have been kept up by the Commissioners Court of the county from that time to time of the trial: and it was shown affirmatively that such overseers and hands have kept the road op.en and free from obstructions, and worked the same for the county, from 1883 to the time of trial, except one week in July, 1887. Sometime in July, 1887, the appellants built a fence across the road in question, and the sheriff of the county, acting under the order of the county judge, removed the fence from across the road.
It was shown, that the jury of view gave no notice to appellants of their intention to lay off a road on their land; that they had no opportunity to present their claim for damages to the jury; and that no compensation had ever been allowed them for the use of said land or for the damage resulting from the establishment of the road thereon. Before bringing this suit appellants presented their claim for damages to the Commissioners Court of the county, and the same was rejected in toto.
Appellants’ tract of land upon which the road is located is open prairie, and has never been under fence, nor used for any purpose except that of grazing live stock.
The court below held:
1. That at the time of the death of the father of the appellants the public had acquired an easement in the land, and that appellants inherited the same subject to the easement.
2. That the Commissioners Court of San Saba County having established the road in August, 1878, appellants’ cause of action was barred by the statute of limitation.
We do not concur in the holding that the public had acquired an easement by prescription. As a general rule, before a highway can be established by prescription, it must appear that the general public, under a claim of right, and not by mere permission of the owner, used some defined way, without interruption or substantial change, for at least the longest period of limitation prescribed by statute against an action for the land; and many authorities hold that such use must be held for at least twenty years. Elliott on Roads and Streets, 137; Schellhouse v. State, 110 Ind., 509; State v. Green, 41 Ia., 619; Pentland v. Keep, 41 Wis., 490; Johnson v. Lewis, 47 Ark., 66.
Where the use is merely permissive, and not adverse, there is no basis on which a right of way by prescription can rest. For this reason, it has been held that the use of vacant unenclosed land for twenty years by the public in passing and repassing will give them no prescriptive rights. State v. Horne, 35 Kans., 717; Rathman v. Norrenberg, 21 Neb., 467; Herrold v. Chicago, 108 Ill., 467; State v. Mitchell, 58 Ia., 567; Railway v. Parker, 41 N. J. Eq., 489; Stewart v. Frink, 94 N. C., 487.
Applying these tests to the case before us, we find that at least one essential element of a right founded upon prescription is wanting.
It was not shown that the county, or any one acting for it or for the public, ever asserted a right to the use of the land in question for a public road, adverse to the title and rights of the appellants, until August, 1878. Up to that time the use of the route traveled by the public as a public highway appears to have been merely permissive, and not antagonistic to-the rights of appellants.
Besides, it has been held that a public road can not be established by prescription while the land over which the road runs is unimproved and unoccupied prairie land, over which people may travel at their pleasure. Smith v. Smith, 34 Kans., 293; State v. O’Laughlin, 19 Kans., 504; Railway v. Long, 27 Kans., 684; Graham v. Harnett, 10 Neb., 517; Hewins v. Smith, 52 Mass., 241; Hardin v. Jasper, 14 Cal., 643.
Upon the question of limitation, our conclusion is, that subdivision 1 of article 3203 of the Revised Statutes, which requires actions for injury done the estate or property of another to be brought within two years, has application; but our most difficult task has been to determine when this statute began to run.
The action of. the Commissioners Court in approving the report of the jury of view and appointing an overseer and hands for the road was not binding as against appellants’ ancestor, who owned the land; yet, whenever the owner obtained knowledge of the fact that the county, acting through the road overseer, had taken actual and visible possession of the road by working it, thereby asserting a claim to it for the county, then we believe limitation began to run.
This appears to be the doctrine announced in Franklin County v. Brooks, 68 Texas, 679; but, as there expressed, it is a mere statement of what the rule would be in a case different from the one then under consideration, and is therefore obiter dictum.
The action of the Commissioners Court in approving the report of the jury of view, etc., in so far as appellants are concerned, was an ex parte order, without binding force upon them; nor did it interfere in anywise with their possession or use of the land; and until appellants were apprised of its existence, we know of no rule of law that would justify us in holding that they were chargeable with notice thereof, in the absence of such facts as would put them upon inquiry.
Delivered November 23, 1892.
The overseer and hands assigned by the Commissioners Court going on the ground and working the road was, in our opinion, sufficient to put the owners of the land upon inquiry, and from that time the statute of limitations will run against appellants, except those who are under such disabilities as exempt them from its provisions.
While the testimony shows that overseers and hands were assigned to this road annually from 1878, it does not affirmatively appear that they worked the road at any time prior to 1883; and as two of the appellants were married women at that time, limitation did not begin nor run against them.
It is to be noted that this suit is for damages, and not for a recovery of the land. If the action was for the land, or if appellants’ petition contained an alternative prayer for the land, the question of limitation, as against the suit for the land, would be altogether different from the one that we have just passed upon.
Nor have we considered the question as to whether a failure to recover damages, because of the plea of limitation, would bar a right of the ■owner of the land to maintain an action for its recovery.
It is settled, in the case of Hamilton County v. Garrett, 62 Texas, 602, that suits of this character may be maintained against counties; and appellants had the right to select this remedy alone if they saw proper to do so.
Because of the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the rules of law above stated.
Reversed and remanded."
219192,"Bonner and Eddy, Receivers, v. Charles Grumbach",1893-03-02,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
No error was committed by the court below in overruling the general demurrer to the petition. While a carrier of passengers is not liable as an insurer of money or other baggage retained in the possession and control of the passenger and lost during the trip, he is bound to use proper care to prevent loss of or injury to it; and if such property or money be lost, as a proximate consequence of negligence of the carrier, he is responsible. 2 Rorer on Rys., 994, 995; Carpenter v. Railway 124 N. Y., 53.
The petition, sufficiently to meet a general demurrer, showed that the money was lost by reason of defendant’s negligence, and expressly denied that any carelessness of the plaintiff contributed. The fact that plaintiff took off his coat and placed it on the seat occupied by him can not be considered such negligence as would preclude him from recovering. There might be losses of property to which such an act of a passenger would contribute in such a manner as to make him chargeable with contributory negligence. But it is not perceived that such would be the case under the facts here alleged. The money is charged to have been lost through the overturning of a coach into the water, brought about by negligence of the defendant. Plaintiff’s act in riding with his coat off in no way helped to bring about that occurrence, which was the immediate cause of the loss. The petition showed that the loss of the money was caused directly and immediately by the fault of the company, through which the car was overturned, without the intervention of negligence of the plaintiff, or of any other cause. The damage claimed was not therefore too remote.
The other assignments of error go to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the judgment. Most of them present the questions above discussed in passing upon the petition, and what is there said is sufficient to dispose of all the points raised in appellants’ brief, except those presented in the third and fourth assignments and the propositions based upon them.
The second proposition under the third assignment is, in substance, that appellee failed to sustain by proof his allegation that appellants were guilty of negligence. The only evidence on this point is, that while the train was on the bridge near the edge of Galveston Bay, the coach in which appellee was sitting was overturned into the water by some cause unknown to him. No effort was made on either side to explain the accident or to show what caused it.
We think tlie court was justified in inferring negligence from the nature of the occurrence and the place at which it took place. While the mere happening of an accident to a passenger train does not necessarily make out a prima facie case of negligence in the carrier, so as to authorize a court to so charge a jury, it is nevertheless evidence to be considered by the court or jury in determining whether or not negligence existed.
In many cases the mishap is of such a nature as, in itself, when unexplained. affords satisfactory proof of the facts. We think this is such a case. Railway v. Suggs, 62 Texas, 324.
We can not assent to the proposition of appellants, that their liability could only arise upon proof of gross negligence. See authorities above cited.
Under their fourth assignment appellants claim that appellee shows himself to have been guilty of negligence after the mishap occurred, in not making proper efforts to recover liis money.
His is the only testimony in the case. He stated, that as soon as he had gotten out of the overturned coach, he called for his coat, and some one unknown to him brought it to him; that he immediately examined for his money, and both it and the pocket-book which contained it were gone, and that he had never since seen or heard of either. He does not show that he made any effort to find it, or any inquiry for it, nor that he notified the servants of appellant that he had lost it, or in any way called upon them to recover it for him. So far as the record shows, they knew nothing of the fact that he had lost or ever had the money. A plaintiff is not required ordinarily to assume the burden of showing that he has not been guilty of negligence; but when the facts which he states expose him to the suspicion that he negligently contributed to his loss, he must clear away such suspicion before he will be permitted to recover. We think the latter rule applies here. It is not probable that in the overturning of the car the money was destroyed. Its ownership was not changed; it remained the property of appellee. Notwithstanding the negligence of appellants, it was still his duty to act as a reasonably prudent person would ordinarily act under like circumstances, and if by so doing he could have prevented the final loss of his property, he ought not to recover. This principle, we think, would require that one situated as he was make such reasonable efforts to regain his property as the situation allowed. Certainly it would require that he at least give notice of his loss to those whom he proposed to charge with responsibility, in order that they might protect both him and themselves, if possible, by recovery of the money.
If the circumstances were such that none of these things could have been done, or such as would have rendered ineffectual any efforts to find the money, that should have been shown. As the evidence stands it does not warrant the judgment rendered.
The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.

216218,C. Aultman & Co. v. H. K. York et al.,1892-11-23,"KEY, Associate Justice.
C. Aultman & Co., a corporation, sued York and John and E. S. Kirby on three notes given for part of the purchase money for a threshing machine, sold to the defendants by Low & Low, acting as agents for plaintiff.
The defenses interposed were fraudulent representations and a breach of warranty.
This is the second appeal, a former judgment in favor of appelleeshaving been reversed. Aultman & Co. v. York, 71 Texas, 261.
Over four years after the suit was instituted, and nearly ñve years after the sale was made, the defendants impleaded Low & Low, and averred that if the representations and contract of warranty made by them were not binding on the plaintiff, then Low & Low should respond in damages, etc.
Low & Low, among other things, pleaded the two years statute of limitation; and while this plea appears to have been fully sustained by the testimony, there was a verdict in favor of the original defendants against Low & Low for $139, which, however, was remitted by the defendants before judgment.
The verdict also declared that defendants were not liable on the notes sued on, and that said notes should be cancelled.
The testimony clearly shows, that the only contract of warranty that Low & Low were authorized to make for the plaintiff was made; that said contract was in writing (or printed), and it was produced by defendants, and put in evidence by plaintiff. By this instrument, and this alone, was the plaintiff bound; and its terms were as obligatory upon defendants as plaintiff. Machine Co. v. Crow, 30 N. W. Rep., 609.
The defendant John Kirby testified that he was induced to purchase the machine by certain verbal representations made by a member of the firm of Low & Low, and that he considered them, Low & Low, liable for all damages.
Delivered November 23, 1892.
It was evidently upon the theory entertained by this defendant that the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants against Low & Low for 8139, and not upon the theory of a breach of the written warranty given by appellant. If this was the theory upon which the verdict against Low & Low was rendered, then the jury, to have been consistent, should have found for appellant against appellees for the full amount of the notes sued on. If, on the other hand, the verdict was based upon a breach of appellant’s warranty, it is not supported by the testimony, because the evidence fails to show that the written notices required by the contract of warranty were given by appellees within the time required, and the question of waiver was not submitted to the jury.
Appellant is entitled to judgment for the full amount of the notes sued on, unless appellees show a breach of the written contract of warranty. And to show such breach, they must show compliance on their part with those parts of the contract requiring them to give written notices, return defective parts, and that there was not continued use of the machine after the expiration of the time named in the warranty, unless it be shown that appellees’ compliance with these terms of the contract has been waived.
The charge of the court did not cover all these phases of the ease as clearly and fully as it should have done.
Because the verdict and judgment are not sustained by the testimony, we reverse the case.
Reversed and remanded."
219094,Annie P. Harris et al. v. W. D. Hoskins,1893-03-02,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
This suit was brought by the heirs of S. Rhoads Fisher, to recover of the appellee, W. B. Hoskins, one-third of a league of land situated in Brazoria County, patented to Hiram H. Russell, March 17, 1875. Plaintiffs claimed title under an alleged transfer of the certificate by virtue of which the land was located to S. Rhoads Fisher, to whom they showed heirship. Defendant pleaded not guilty, and on the trial deraigned title from a junior transfer of the certificate, which was no doubt made under a forged power of attorney. Defendant pleaded also limitations of three, five, and ten years; also stale demand and estoppel.
On the trial below the plaintiffs offered in evidence an instrument in writing, under which they claimed title to the certificate, purporting to have been executed by Hiram H. Russell and witnessed by E. M. Pease and H. C. Hudson. It was dated July 26, 1836, and attached thereto is the certificate of A. Brigham, first auditor in the Treasury Department of Texas, made on said date at Velasco, which recited, that before him, “ for the want of a judge or notary public, there being neither in this place, personally appeared Hiram H. Russell, who declared that the above is his true signature,” and also that it was attested in his presence by E. M. Pease and H. C. Hudson. Said instrument was endorsed, “ Filed 4th October, 1836. E. H. Winfield, clerk D. C. B.” It was also filed for record in the record of deeds for Brazoria County, August 30, 1887, and then recorded; and again, on proof made by the affidavit of H. Masterson, dated June 23, 1891, to the handwriting of E. M. Pease, and that the grantor and grantee were dead, and the other witness, H. C. Hudson, he verily believed to be dead, the instrument was filed for record June 23, 1891, and admitted to record on July 4, 1891, in said record of deeds.
Plaintiffs also offered, in connection with said instrument, evidence of the genuineness of the signature of the subscribing witness E. M. Pease; and- also the early records of Brazoria county, to show that E. H. Win-field was clerk of the court in Brazoria in 1836 or 1837; and evidence that said instrument was found in the county clerk’s office in Brazoria County; that in the place where it was found there were papers of like character—Spanish records and the like. There is also evidence in the statement of facts that the instrument was found by plaintiffs’ attorney in a package of old deeds, in a place in the office where ancient documents were kept, during the year 1886 or early in the year 1887; also-tending to show that the grantor in said instrument, S. Rhoads Fisher, had possession of the certificate, and that it was claimed to be the property of the estate of said Fisher, and was lost.
The original instrument has been sent up with the transcript for the inspection of the court. It bears every evidence of antiquity, and appears to be a genuine document. It is as follows:
“ To all whom it may concern: Be it known and made manifest, that I, Hiram H. Russell, residing in the Republic of Texas, being fully entitled by law as a citizen and settler, furthermore as a member of the New Orleans Volunteer Greys, having been concerned in the capture of San Antonio at the commencement of the present war, to one unlocated third of a league of land in Texas; and whereas, by the general provision of the Constitution of Texas any citizen is permitted to transfer his headright or other right to land by bargain, sale, or' exchange, and in such case the person to whom such right shall have been transferred shall be entitled to the same as fully and completely as the person making the transfer might or could have been; now therefore, for and in consideration of the sum of 8100, the receipt whereof I hereby acknowledge, I do hereby grant, bargain, sell, and transfer unto S. Rhoads Fisher, a citizen of Texas, all my right, title, and interest in and to the above mentioned portion of land not yet located; and I do, for myself, my heirs, executors, and administrators, warrant and defend the right and - title herein transferred unto the said Fisher, his heirs and assigns, forever; hereby granting him and all who shall claim under him full and irrevocable power to locate, take formal possession of, and complete the title to the same, in my name or in his own name, according as may be most proper and legal in the full and complete securing of the same unto the said Fisher, his heirs, and assigns, together with all other rights and privileges which in any case may be requisite and necessary for the absolute ownership and enjoyment of said third of a league; and for the further stability of this instrument, I do by these presents renounce the benefit of all laws or parts of laws which may or can affect the validity or intention of this complete and absolute transfer.

On the objection of defendant, the court excluded the instrument from the consideration of the jury, and instructed them to return a verdict for the defendant.
In terms the instrument was sufficient to transfer the title to the certificate, and consequently, upon its location, the title to the land. As an ancient document, it would be sufficient if there was evidence to show that it came from proper custody, because it appears to be free from suspicion and is over thirty years old. All the evidence as to the custody is, that by some means the deed was deposited by some one with the clerk of Brazoria County, probably at the date of the file mark thereon, and was found in the clerk’s office in an old package of deeds, in 1886 or in 1887. It would not be necessary for the instrument to come from the possession or custody of the grantee, but it must be shown to have come from a proper depository. 1 Whart. on Ev., 194.
At the time of the execution of the instrument the land had not been located, and there was no occasion for the deposit thereof with the clerk of the Brazoria court.
We do not think that the evidence was sufficient to support the transfer as an ancient instrument. It was also never properly of record, and was not admissible as a recorded instrument.
But there is a distinction to be observed between the proof of an instrument for record under the registration laws, and the proof of the execution of an instrument when offered in evidence on the trial of a cause. In the latter case the proof must be made by the production of the subscribing witnesses, or one of them, if any, if he be living; but if the subscribing witnesses be dead or incompetent to testify, or can not be procured, and in other like cases, then secondary evidence of its execution is admissible, as this proof is made by proof of the handwriting of the subscribing witnesses. Cairrell v. Higgs, 1 Posey’s U. C., 56; 1 Whart. on Ev., secs. 726, 1359.
The nonproduction of the witnesses should be accounted for by the party offering the deed; but after the lapse of thirty years the death of the witnesses will be presumed. The affidavit of Masterson, attached to the transfer, of the death of the witnesses and of the handwriting of E. M. Pease was not properly evidence; but it is stated in the bill of exceptions, that the instrument was offered with evidence of the genuineness of the signature of E. M. Pease. This, under the circumstances, was sufficient proof of the execution of the transfer for its admission in evidence before the jury, and the court erred in excluding it.
Appellee contends, that the case was virtually tried by the court, and that there was a finding against the execution of the instrument after the hearing of all the evidence by the court, and that the case should now be so considered by this court, and the finding of the court below sustained. The bill of exception states, that “ the court excluded said instrument of transfer from the evidence, and refused to permit it to be read to the jury for any purpose, and instructed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant.”
We do not feel authorized to deprive the plaintiffs of the right of trial of the issue by a jury, and shall reverse and remand the case. Defendant’s pleas and proof of limitations were met by plea and proof of coverture and minority on the part of most of the plaintiffs, and the judgment can not be affirmed on the ground of limitations.
The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded.

216207,Pauline Rozwadosfskie v. International & Great Northern Railway Company,1892-11-23,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
This is a suit by the appellant, plaintiff below, for herself, as widow, and the minor children of herself and Frank Rozwadosfskie, for damages against the appellee, defendant below, resulting from the alleged negligent killing of Frank Rozwadosfskie by defendant, by running its freight train over him, at San Marcos, Texas, on the 9th day of December, 1888.
The court below instructed the jury to find for the defendant, which they did, and the judgment was so rendered; from which the plaintiff has appealed.
The facts of the case are as follows:
Deceased was about forty years old, a carpenter by trade, earning about $2.25 per day; a strong, robust man, and in good health. He lived with his family at San Marcos, Texas, about 230 or 265 yards from defendant’s depot. He was working at his trade at Kyle, through which defendant’s railway passed, about eight miles northeast of San Marcos. For several nights prior to the 9th of December, 1888, he was expected home as a passenger on defendant’s train. He sometimes drank to excess after his week’s work, when he was paid off, and his wife was expecting him home in an intoxicated condition. She sent her two boys, Martin and Frank, aged respectively 13 and 10 years, to meet him at the train and to conduct him home in case he was drunk. The boys had frequently met him at the train, and had brought him home, and on one occasion he was drunk, ‘ ‘ not very,” he never having refused to go with them. The night of December 9 was cold, and the two boys were at the depot, in the waiting room, where there was a fire, expecting their father on the train due later in the night. The station agent asked them what they were there for. Frank, the older boy, replied that they were there waiting for their father, who was coming on the train from Kyle. He told them that they had been there two or three nights, waiting for him, and that he had not come, and was not coming, and that if they did not leave the depot, and not come around there any more, he would have them arrested and put in jail. His manner and language were rough, and so frightened them that one of them was crying. They were not misbehaving. One of them had been seen about the depot, swinging on the steps of the cars and jumping off while the cars were in motion. They left, and when they got outside, a policeman told them to run on home and come back when they heard the whistle blow. This was 9 or 10 o’clock p. m. They went home and went to sleep, did not hear the whistle, and were not there when their father arrived on the train, between 10 and 11 o’clock on the same night, the 9th of December, 1888.
Deceased boarded the train at Kyle about 10 o’clock that night. Witness Johnson went with him to the depot and carried his baggage and assisted him on the train. He was drunk, but not imbecile. He knew what he was doing and where he was going; gave Johnson 25 cents, the exact amount, to purchase him a ticket to San Marcos. He staggered in walking several times, and would have fallen if Johnson had not assisted him. He had a bottle of whisky. In getting on the train he came near falling, and would have done so if Johnson had not caught him. The conductor was looking at him at the time. The steps from the ground were high, and there was no stool, and he had to catch hold of the step rail and pull himself up. The conductor on the train knew his drunken condition. He was helped on to the first seat after entering the car.
When the train arrived at San Marcos, deceased threw his bundle of clothes, or something of the kind, out before him on the platform, and then got out himself and leaned up against the car, when some gentleman took hold of him, pulled him away, and told him to “ look out.” After the train left, he was seen in the depot at the ticket window, talking to Mr. Collins, the agent, about his baggage, and said he would leave it there till morning.
Witness Meredith, speaking of this, says further: “I then came out of the depot house and started up to town, and when I was about Prince’s lunch stand, deceased called me, and came up behind me, and we then walked on together up to Brown <fc Lindsay’s livery stable, 200 yards from the depot. Deceased caught hold of Mr. Summerrow, who was with me, and said, ‘ You are not afraid of me, are you ?’ to which Mr. Summerrow replied, ‘No, I am not afraid of you.’ Mr. Summerrow pulled away from him, and we walked on together. Deceased followed us some 10 or 15 steps, and said to us that ‘ we could get all the drink we wanted, that the houses were all open here yet.’ Deceased then turned back toward the depot house, and I and Mr. Summerrow came on up to town. That was the last I saw of the deceased till the 10th of December, 1888. I saw him at his house in San Marcos, dead. He was a stranger to me.”
The statements quoted of this witness are true, and are corroborated by Mr. Summerrow, except that he did not hear the conversation with the agent.
The depot is 700 or 800 feet from the home of deceased, 100 or 200 feet further than the livery stable near which Meredith last saw him.
The platform extends along the track east and west of the depot building; is about 2\ or 3 feet higher than the track, and about 3 feet from the track.
Dr. Atkinson was called to deceased after he was hurt, and found him on the west end of the platform, about 70 feet from the depot at San Marcos. He testified, and we so find the facts:
“His left arm was mangled, he had three scalp wounds, and his left leg was seriously injured. He died next morning from the injuries. He had been run over by the wheels of the cars, as was evident from the condition of the wounds. When I arrived at the depot the hind wheels of the caboose of the freight train were standing about 35 feet from the body of the deceased. Blood was found on the car next to the tender, but none on the wheels of the engine or tender. There was blood between the rail and the platform. He was strong, robust, and healthy. It was evident that the wheels of one car had run over him. Deceased was evidently under the influence of liquor and had lain down and gone to sleep.”
The evidence does not show any further particulars of the manner of the killing.
It is contended by appellant, “that the driving of plaintiff’s sons from the depot, and preventing them from meeting their father and conducting him home, was the immediate and proximate cause of his death,” and that therefore defendant would be liable in damages for his death in this suit.
This proposition, in our opinion, is not the law of the case.
It must be borne in mind that plaintiff can not recover unless the deceased himself could successfully maintain the action if living and suing in his own behalf for the injuries received. Rev. Stats., art. 2090.
Plaintiff’s sons had the right to be in the waiting room of defendant’s depot to await the arrival of their father and conduct him home, and the act of the agent in sending them away might be held to be grossly wrong, and had they been injured thereby the company would be liable therefor, if the agent was acting within the scope of his authority. Hamilton v. Railway, 64 Texas, 251.
But it would not necessarily follow from this that the company would be liable for the death of their father, whose contributory negligence was the proximate cause of the same.
At the time the agent required the boys to leave the depot, he did not know the deceased was drunk and would arrive in that condition, nor did he know that they were sent there to protect him on the way home on account of his expected helplessness from intoxication. He only knew that they were there to meet him. This being so, the wrong was too remote from the injury to create liability. Had he known all the facts, then his act would have included all its reasonable and probable consequences flowing therefrom. He and his principal could be held culpable only for what was known to him, or what he would be presumed to know. 1 Sherm. & Redf. on Neg., secs. 29, 26, 27, 28.
Under the circumstances of the ease, we do not think the company owed him any peculiar duty after his arrival at San Marcos. Had he required assistance on account of his helpless condition while the relation of' carrier and passenger existed, the company may have been negligent in refusing it. But he required no assistance at that time. Patt. Ry. Acc. Law, sec. 278.
Circumstances would control this liability. He was not discharged at an unusual place, where the company would be bound to protect him further or be held bound for any danger he might voluntarily incur.
This case is not at all similar to the one cited by appellant, Railway v. Sullivan, 81 Kentucky, 624, where an inebriated passenger was ejected from the cars, away from any station, in the snow, who, before he could obtain relief, the temperature being ten degrees below zero, had his feet, hands, shoulder, parts of his legs and of one arm frozen.
We select this case, cited by appellant, to illustrate the distinction that should be made. The principle governing that class of cases and the one at bar is not the same. The difference is quite apparent. In the case at bar, the passenger reached his destination, voluntarily alighted from the train, as was his duty to do at the end of his journey, at a regular station in a town near his home, made arrangements for his baggage, and left the depot and premises of the defendant, and thereby unquestionably ended all further obligations on the part of the company to him, whether he was sick, intoxicated, or sober. The company certainly, under these circumstances, had discharged all its obligations to him, and owed him no further duty as a passenger. Patt. Ry. Acc. Law, secs. 220, 221.
He afterward returned and laid down in such proximity to or upon the track as to endanger his life by moving trains; and, in fact, so lost his life. He could not claim immunity from the rule of contributory negligence because he was then drunk, unless the facts show such negligence or want of care on the part of defendant’s servants as would render the company liable, notwithstanding his own negligence. The fact that he was there drunk and asleep would not justify the defendant’s servants in running the train over him and taking his life. If he was seen by them in time, and they were aware of his danger, and by ordinary care they could have avoided the injury, they were bound to do so; but there is no testimony of this character. Railway v. Evans, 71 Texas, 369; Beach on Con. Neg., 390, 391; Railway v. Sympkins, 54 Texas, 623; Patt. Ry. Acc. Law, secs. 76, 77, 78.
There is no such negligence shown on the part of defendant or its servants as will render it liable for the death of the deceased, nor such as would relieve him of the consequences of his own negligence directly contributory thereto.
A part of defendant’s answer, read in evidence by plaintiff, is claimed by appellant to show negligence on the part of the company that would entitle her to a recovery. The extract is as follows:
“ That the place where he so lay down was darkened by the shadow of said platform, and he was obscured from the view from any one on any part of any approaching train, and could not have been seen by the exercise of the utmost care and caution on the part of the persons in charge of such approaching train.”
In this connection, it should be stated that it was also averred and proved, that after the relation of carrier and passenger ceased the deceased left the depot and voluntarily returned and lay down near defendant’s railway track, between the track and the depot platform, and there went to sleep.
Delivered November 23, 1892.
The portion of the answer read does not disclose actionable negligence on the part of defendant.
It is the duty of the company to keep lighted, at proper times, its depot, approaches, and other places connected therewith which are likely to be visited by passengers and persons lawfully on the premises; and a negligent omission of this duty, causing injury, would entitle the injured party, without fault on his part, to damages. Bish. on Non-Cont. Law, sec. 1086.
But contributory negligence on the part of the person injured might, as before explained, defeat the right of recovery, as in this case we think it did.
There is, however, another ground upon which the averment in defendant’s answer can not be made available in establishing its negligence. It is not shown that lights were needed at the point indicated, for the convenience of any person visiting the depot or for the purpose of moving the trains. It could not be presumed, in the absence of testimony, that a light should be placed so as to discover persons that might be lying in such an unusual place, asleep or drunk. There was no testimony upon the subject, and the allegation does not show the necessity for such a light. Therefore negligence on the part of the company can not be rested upon it.
The evidence was very meagre as to how the accident occurred, outside of the fact that the deceased was lying near the track asleep, in a place of great danger; no evidence that the train men or any of the company’s servants saw him, knew or ought to have known that he was there, or that they were guilty of any negligence causing the injury. All that the evidence shows is, that the occurrence was attributable to the negligence of the deceased, without fault on the part of defendant or its employes, and for which it is not liable.
In such case it was the duty of the court to, instruct the jury to find for defendant. Railway v. Porter, 73 Texas, 307; Railway v. Dean, 76 Texas, 73.
The judgment of the court below should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.
Affirmed."
219093,The New York and Texas Steamship Company v. The Island City Boating and Athletic Association,1893-03-02,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
This is the second appeal in this cause. On the former appeal the judgment was reversed and the cause remanded by the Supreme Court; and the case is reported on pages 375-379 of the 80tli volume of Texas Reports.
The plaintiff, a corporation under the laws of Texas, by its amended original petition, complains of the New York and Texas Steamship Company, appellant here, a corporation owning and operating a line of steamships plying between the States of New York and Texas, a common carrier, that on the 21st day of July, 1888, a certain six-oared barge or gig was delivered to the appellant, consigned by Waters & Sons to the appellee; that said boat was received by the appellant in good order arid condition under its contract to deliver the same at Galveston, and thereupon a bill of lading was executed. That on the 1st day of August, 1888, said boat or gig arrived at Galveston on board one of the steamships •of appellant, and was tendered to appellee in a damaged condition, having been damaged through the negligence of the appellant. That said damaged condition being called to the attention of appellant and its agents, it and the said agents recognized the said damage, and admitted to plaintiff that the same was damaged, and had been damaged while in its custody, and recognized and admitted its responsibility and liability for said damage, and thereupon 'contracted and agreed with plaintiff that it, the said defendant, would replace said boat with a similar and perfect boat of the same character, size, make, and structure; and further promised, agreed, and contracted, that if it, the said defendant, did not so replace said boat or gig with a new and perfect boat or gig within a reasonable time thereafter, that it would pay the plaintiff the value of said boat so damaged as aforesaid, which agreement and promise plaintiff accepted and acquiesced in.
The appellee then alleges, that defendant has become liable to pay plaintiff by said promise the value of the boat, or to replace the same by another boat as aforesaid, and that the said boat was of the value of $700; that defendant has failed and refused to comply with its contract, to the damage of plaintiff in the sum of $700.
Defendant, by amended answer, demurred generally and specially to plaintiff’s petition, and among other special demurrers, to the effect that plaintiff’s ""petition failed to set up any consideration for the alleged paroi contract; answered by general denial, and specially denied the making of a paroi contract.
The cause was tried before a jury, and the verdict was for plaintiff in the sum of $500, with 6 per cent interest from the 24th of March, 1889, on which verdict judgment was rendered for $578.08, to which judgment, a motion for new trial having been filed by the defendant and overruled-by the court, the defendant excepted, and in open court gave notice of appeal.
From this statement of the plaintiff’s suit, it is seen that it is based solely upon the alleged special contract set out in the petition. The first assignment of error presented in appellant’s brief is, that the court erred in overruling defendant’s third special exception to plaintiff’s amended original petition. This exception assumes that the petition fails to set out any consideration for the alleged contract. To this assumption we-can not assent, and therefore hold that the court did not err in overruling the exception. The petition avers, that the plaintiff was the owner of a barge or gig shipped to it by the steamship of defendant, defendant being a common carrier between the city of New York and the city of Galveston, and while in the possession of defendant, and by its negligence, the gig was damaged, and that defendant recognized and.admitted the-liability to plaintiff, and promised and agreed with plaintiff as averred and set out in the petition.
The appellant, upon the trial of the cause, offered to show by the testimony of several witnesses the financial condition of the plaintiff at the-time of the arrival of the barge or gig, after it had been repaired, for the purpose of showing that the real and true reason why plaintiff declined to accept the barge was not because it was not as good and valuable after it was repaired as it was before it was injured, but because plaintiff was-without money in its treasury to pay the price of the boat; and upon objection to this evidence by plaintiff, it was excluded by the court, and appellant excepted. But in none of its bills of exception to the exclusion of this evidence is the objection made by the plaintiff to the evidence given.
We must therefore decline to consider these exceptions. Under such circumstances, every presumption is in favor of the correctness of the ruling of the court. Railway v. Gage. 63 Texas, 568. For the like reason, we decline to consider the exceptions of appellant to the exclusion of testimony offered to show that the defendant was instructed by the manufacturer and vendor of the barge not to deliver same until plaintiff paid both the price of that boat and the price of another ordered by plaintiff, and held by the manufacturer for shipment to plaintiff; and of testimony tending to show plaintiff’s willingness to accept the barge after it had been repaired, upon condition that the vendor would accept the money advanced by plaintiff to him as a payment upon the repaired boat, and relieve plaintiff from obligation to take the other boat ordered by it.
We do not think the court erred in sustaining exceptions to questions propounded to witness Hodges, with the view of showing the actual cost of the boat. There was nothing in the pleadings to authorize the introduction of such evidence; the plaintiff sued to recover on an alleged contract, by which defendant undertook and promised to deliver to plaintiff “another boat of same character, size, make, and structure,” or to pay the value of the boat injured by defendant; and because there may have been conflict in the testimony of plaintiff’s witnesses, the defendant could not introduce evidence to establish another and different contract than the one alleged by plaintiff, unless defendant had itself alleged the contract to be such as it proposed to prove. Besides, the bill of exceptions taken to the exclusion of this evidence has the same vice as the other bills referred to above; it does not state the objections made to the evidence by the plaintiff.
We do not think the court erred in refusing the first and the fourth special charges requested by appellant, for the reason that they were not applicable to the case made by the pleadings and the evidence. The second charge requested by defendant, and refused by the court, might have been properly given; but its refusal was harmless error, inasmuch as the rejected charge was substantially given in the court’s charge.
The charge given by the court is not, in our opinion, subject to the ■criticisms embraced under the appellant’s eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-first assignments. The charge of the court stated the contract alleged by plaintiff to have been made with it by defendant, and the jury were expressly told, unless they believed from the evidence that the 1 ‘ aforesaid alleged contract and agreement was entered into by and between the parties through their agents,” the plaintiff should not recover, and the verdict should be for the defendant. If the charge was defective in the particular specified under the twenty-second assignment of error, the appellant should have sought, by asking an appropriate charge, to have the defect cured. While there is some conflict in the evidence as to what was the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, our conclusion is, that the weight of the evidence upon this issue is with the plaintiff.
We have thoughtfully examined the records of this case, and finding no error which would authorize a reversal of the judgment of the lower court, it must be affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered March 2, 1893."
219177,James Johnston et al. v. The Lasker Real Estate Association,1893-01-26,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
This action was brought by the appellee, the Lasker Real Estate Association, in the District Court of Galveston County, against James Johnston, for debt and to foreclose certain liens therefor. Appellant M. A. Martin was made a party defendant, as executrix of W. H. Martin, deceased, who had a junior lien.
The indebtedness sued on grew out of an indebtedness of the said James Johnston to the First National Bank of Brown wood, which had been transferred to plaintiff by said national bank and one Brooke Smith, the cashier of said bank. It arose in this way:
James Johnston bought the lot of land upon which the liens are sought to be foreclosed from Coggin & Parks, and in part payment thereof executed to them his promissory note, with vendor’s lien on the land, for the sum of $465.60, dated October 7, 1884, payable on demand to the order of said Coggin & Parks, with 12 per cent interest per annum from the date of the note until paid, and 10 per cent attorney fee if collected by law. He erected on said lot a two-story stone building. This note Cog-gin & Parks transferred to said Brooke Smith without recourse on them.
Afterwards, on March 7, 1885, Johnston executed to William Cameron & Co. his promissory note for $2010, payable to their order on or before December 7, 1885, with 12 per cent interest, and in order to secure the same executed a deed of trust to the defendant W. B. Eskridge upon the lot of land conveyed to him by Coggin & Parks. This note William Cameron & Co. endorsed, without recourse, to said Brooke Smith.
On October 17, 1884, the said Johnston, in consideration of borrowed money, executed his note to the First National Bank of Brownwood for the sum of $3000, and in order to indemnify the said Brooke Smith, who signed said note with him as surety, Johnston executed and delivered to said Smith his promissory note of the same date for the sum of $3500, payable on demand after date, waiving grace and protest, to the order of said Smith, with 12 per cent interest and 10 per cent attorney fee, secured by a deed of trust upon the same property. This note was endorsed by the said Brooke Smith, in blank, and delivered by him to the bank as collateral to the said note for $3000.
Johnston was then indebted to the bank upon the Coggin & Parks vendor’s lien note, the William Cameron & Co. note, and the $3000 note for which the note and deed of trust for $3500 had been executed as indemnifying security, and in other sums of money not secured by lien. The deed of trust for the $3500 note expressed also a lien on the rents of the Johnston building, in addition to the property itself. For this total indebtedness Johnston executed to the bank his note due at ninety days, which included a discount at the rate of 18 per cent per annum; and at the end of every ninety days a new ninety days note was executed and discounted at the same rate for the total indebtedness then due. The bank collected the rents of the building as they fell due, and applied them to the note then in force representing the aggregate indebtedness, treating and holding the lien notes as collateral security for whatever balance Johnston should owe.
On December 30, 1886, there was a balance of $5500 due the bank, which Johnston desired to have extended. Plaintiff agreed to take up the indebtedness and extend time, and Johnston executed and delivered to it a note for the full amount, dated January 1, 1887, payable to the order of plaintiff eighteen months after date, with interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum, payable semi-annually, in advance, and 10 per cent attorney fee if placed in the hands of an attorney for collection. This note was in accordance with a written agreement, dated December 30, 1886, and recited that the other notes were held by and hypothecated to plaintiff as collateral security for its payment. Plaintiff paid the indebtedness to the bank, and the bank and Brooke Smith, by an agreement in writing, transferred the above described lien notes to plaintiff, reciting that there was yet due on the Coggin & Parks note $400, on the Cameron note $2000, and on the Brooke Smith $3500 note $3100, making a total of $5500, and warranted that said amounts were the true amounts due and unpaid, and that the liens had never been released; but as to further liability without recourse. To the above mentioned agreement was annexed an agreement by Johnston, recognizing the validity of the notes and the liens to secure them, and in consideration of the extension of time, that he would keep the property insured, pay principal and interest in Galveston, and waived the statute of limitations.
The junior lien of appellant M. A. Martin’s testator, W. H. Martin, was a deed of trust executed upon the same and other property, June 24, 1885, to secure the note of said Johnston of that date for $6295.45, and conveyed the property to the defendant Henry Ford as trustee, ‘‘ subject, however, to a lien in favor of said First National Bank for about $3500,. and another lien in favor of William Cameron for about $2025.”
Plaintiff in its petition set out the several lien notes and the facts leading to the execution of the note for $5500, which, it averred, was given to evidence in brief form the terms of the agreement dated December 30, 1886, and was for the same indebtedness and none other than that evidenced by the three promissory notes above described.
Mrs. Martin pleaded as a defense against said notes the statute of limitations and usury. As a junior encumbrancer of the lands, she could avail herself of, and set up as against the indebtedness sued on, whatever ■defense Johnston, the maker of the notes, had, although he was a party to the suit and suffered judgment by default. Arledge v. Hail, 54 Texas, 401; Burks v. Watson, 48 Texas, 110. If the limitation had run against the .lien notes, Mrs. Martin could have availed herself of it and pleaded it in bar of a recovery; but the agreement of December 30, 1886, made' by Johnston with the Lasker Real Estate Association for the purpose of having his debt to the bank taken up, acknowledged the validity of the three notes and agreed to pay them, waiving the statute of limitations. This agreement was made after the deed of trust in favor of W. H. Martin had been executed and recorded, and the question arises whether Johnston, by a promise made subsequent to his act creating the junior encumbrance on the lot, could renew his obligation on the notes so as to deprive the junior encumbrancer of the defense of limitation. That he could, was the effect of the decision in Ware v. Bennett, 18 Texas, 794. Such is also the great weight of authority. Wood on Lim., sec. 230, and note 2; Ang. on Lim., sec. 460; Heyer v. Pruyn, 7 Paige, 465; Hughes v. Edwards, 9 Wheat., 497. It is also competent for the mortgagor to arrange for an extension of the mortgage debt, and an agreement to extend the time of payment will not discharge the lien of the mortgage as to subsequent encumbrancers. Whittacre v. Fuller, 5 Minn., 508.
It was shown by the evidence, that the balance of indebtedness taken up by the plaintiff, and for which Johnston executed his note for $5500, was ascertained after the application of the rents of the building, which were collected by the bank, to the payment of usurious interest. Mrs. Martin p'eaded usury, and contends that all interest should be forfeited, and the rents should be applied to the principal of the lien notes; first, to the note for the amount of indebtedness represented by the $3500 note and deed of trust, which was also a lien on the rents, and then to the other notes.
There are many authorities which hold that usury is a defense so strictly personal that a third party can not avail himself thereof; but it seems that 11 the doctrine more generally adopted is, that not only the mortgagor, but any person who is seized of his estate and vested with his rights, unless he has assumed the payment of the mortgage, may interpose this defense, although a mere stranger can not.” 1 Jones on Mort., sec. 644. A junior mortgagee may set up usury in the mortgage. Id., and authorities cited in note 9.
When a purchaser of the equity of redemption assumes the payment of the mortgage, it becomes a part of the consideration paid for the land, and it is immaterial with such purchaser whether there is usury in the mortgage or not. The language used in the Martin deed of trust, that it is taken subject to the liens in favor of the Brooke Smith and Cameron & Co. notes, is nothing more than a mere acknowledgment of notice of these liens, and does not affect the holder of the Martin encumbrance with any obligation not to set up any lawful defense which Johnston himself may have then had or subsequently acquired to the notes.
We do not think, however, that the Coggin & Parks vendor’s lien note nor the William Cameron & Co. note were tainted with usury. It was only subsequently to their execution, and after they had been transferred to the bank, that the question of usury arises, and then usurious interest was paid and taken upon sums represented by them as the amounts paid for them. With reference to the amounts represented by these notes, we do not think the entire amount of interest should be forfeited; only the excess of interest over the amount called for in their face should be credited on the principal. The note for $3500 was executed to indemnify the said Brooke Smith as an endorser of a note executed by the said Johnston to the bank for §3000. As the creditor of Johnston, with Smith as security, the bank was entitled to whatever security Smith had, and when Smith endorsed the note for $3500 to the bank, it became in the hands of the bank merely collateral security for the note of Johnston to the bank for $3000. The latter note was discounted to the bank for $2865, being at the rate of 18 per cent per annum, a rate which was usurious, so the contract was a usurious contract. All payments of interest on this note, whether by way of discount or otherwise, should be applied to the principal thereof, including the first discount. In the judgment below the court seems to have only allowed the excess of interest as a credit on the principal, which was error. As a new note was executed every ninety •days for the aggregate indebtedness, and discounted afresh, it follows that there should be quarterly rests in the computation of the interest, so as to ascertain the amounts to be credited, and we are not in the possession of sufficient data to enable us to arrive at the amount. It may be that the books of the bank will show the actual amounts received as interest.
Johnston remained in the possession of the property, and in addition to the payment of interest applied the rents to the extinction of his unsecured indebtedness. Appellant contends, that as the deed of trust for the $3500 note was also a lien on the rents, they should have been applied entirely to the extinction of the lien. This seems to be otherwise. 1 Jones on Mort., sec. 670. Johnston remained in possession of the rents as of the other property included in the deed of trust, and had the right of disposition thereof until possession was taken under the deed of trust. But when the receiver was appointed and the property taken charge of by the court, the rents should then have been applied at least to the ex-tinguishment of the lien on the property and rents to secure the note for $3500; hence the court erred in adjudging that the rents accumulated and to accumulate in the hands of the receiver after his appointment should be applied to the payment of that portion of the plaintiff’s judgment which had been postponed to the appellants’ lien.
We do not think that it is necessary to notice the eighth and ninth assignments of error, for the reason that no such affirmative relief was properly sought, even if there should be no other reason.
The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded for another trial in accordance with the opinion herein expressed.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered January 26, 1893."
216208,"Herman Seele et al. v. The State, ex rel. B. Roether",1892-11-23,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
This is a prohibition suit, brought in the District Court of Comal County, wherein an original proceeding to annul a judgment rendered by the Justice Court was prohibited on the ground of want of jurisdiction of the Justice Court to grant such relief.
The justice of the peace before whom the proceedings were pending and the plaintiff in the proceeding to annul the judgment of the Justice Court were defendants. They answered by general and special exceptions to the sufficiency of the petition, and by plea to the jurisdiction of the District Court to grant the extraordinary writ of prohibition, and by general denial. On a final hearing, the writ of prohibition was perpetuated, and the respondents have appealed therefrom to this court.
The only question that we decide is, had the District Court, in 1888, jurisdiction to grant and perpetuate a writ of prohibition against proceedings about to be had in a Justice Court ?
Prohibition acts directly upon the court, and is a common law writ that lies only when the matter to be prohibited is judicial in nature. It is preventive in character, and is ordinarily at common law used to prevent a court of inferior powers from usurping its jurisdiction in some judicial matter. It is issued by a court of superior jurisdiction to one that is inferior. This necessarily requires an investigation into the jurisdiction of the court that issues the writ and of that against which it is directed, in order to determine if it will lie.
If the court against which the writ is directed is free and independent of any supervisory control of the tribunal of superior jurisdiction, and is within the limits of its jurisdiction general in the sense that it has the power to hear and determine the subjects of its jurisdiction in its own way, then the writ would not lie, unless the law that created the superior tribunal conferred upon it the power to issue the writ.
Every court within this State jurisdiction that has the power to hear and determine judicial controversies is general in its jurisdiction over the subjects that they have cognizance of by the law of their creation; but all such courts are also of special jurisdiction, in the sense that they can not hear and determine subjects of controversy that are not embraced in the written law that creates and defines their powers. To the written law alone they look to ascertain when they have the power to hear and determine, and when this jurisdiction is prescribed it is restrictive of all other.
With us these principles of law apply as well to Justice Courts as they do to the District Courts.
There is no inherent power in the District Court, by virtue of its law and equity jurisdiction, to issue all writs that were known to common law and equity practice. For if such was the rule, it would permit the court to exercise a jurisdiction to meet the exigencies of each case, and would relieve it from the application of the principle, well settled with us, that it can not exceed the power conferred by the law that created it, and that the enumeration of these powers excludes the right to exercise others.
The present Constitution, as it existed when the writ of prohibition in this cause was issued and perpetuated, in conferring jurisdiction upon the District Courts, among other things, says:
“ Said courts and the judges thereof shall have power to issue writs of habeas corpus in felony cases, mandamus, injunction, certiorari, and all writs necessary to enforce their jurisdiction.”
The acts of the Legislature on the subject of the jurisdiction of the District Courts in this respect follow the Constitution. Neither by the Constitution nor by legislation thereunder is a supervisory control and jurisdiction given to the District Courts over Justice Courts or other inferior tribunals, as was given by the Constitution of 1845 and that of 1869.
The provisions of the Constitution quoted is all that has any bearing upon the question before us.
It is apparent that the omission from the present Constitution of that provision of the Constitution of 1845 and 1869 that conferred upon the •District Court a supervisory control and jurisdiction over inferior courts, is equivalent to a legislative declaration that such jurisdiction shall not exist.
Delivered November 23, 1892.
It is further apparent, that the writ issued in this case was not in furtherance of the jurisdiction of the District Court as necessary to the enforcement of its jurisdiction, as the judicial matter sought to be prohibited was pending in another tribunal of equal dignity with that of the District Court, in so far as its jurisdiction extended over subjects of which it had cognizance.
If the provision of the Constitution in question had included prohibition, as it did injunction and other named writs, it would have been within the jurisdiction of the District Court to have issued such writs in all cases that were permitted under the principles and usages of common law and equity practice, as is illustrated by the construction of the law in question in the case of County of Anderson v. Kennedy, 58 Texas, 621.
We find no provision in the law that conferred upon the District Court the power to issue the writ of prohibition.
Such being the case, we .reverse the judgment of the court below, with instructions to dismiss the case.
Reversed and dismissed."
216301,Eugene Williams v. C. P. Bennett et al.,1892-11-30,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
This is a second suit of trespass to try title, brought by the appellant against C. P. Bennett and J. R. Bennett, for six acres of land, alleged in the petition to be a part of the Samuel Johnson survey, in McLennan County.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
There was a valid grant of eleven leagues of land, including the six acres sued for, made to Miguel Rabago, September 24, January —, 1834.
Plaintiff claimed the land by valid conveyances from the only heirs of Rabago, who died in 1848.
Rabago, on May 25, 1836, by attorney in fact, conveyed the eleven leagues to Guillermo Laguerenne, who was then residing in the City of Mexico, an alien to Texas.
Defendants set up this conveyance as an outstanding title; and it is admitted that if by it Laguerenne acquired title, plaintiff has no title and can not recover.
Defendants also set up title under patent to Samuel Johnson, a junior title to the Rabago.
The court below gave judgment for the defendants, on the ground that the deed to Laguerenne conveyed the Rabago grant to him, and that therefore plaintiff could not recover. Plaintiff appealed, and filed transcript in Supreme Court March 31, 1890.
The parties have made an agreed case, under rule 59, clause 2, of the Supreme Court, as follows:
“In compliance with clause 2 of. rule 59, Supreme Court, it is agreed that there is no controversy as to the facts in this cause.
“The issues presented are of law, and are clearly stated in the assignment of errors, and are briefly herein set out.
“1. D. H. Williams, vendor of appellant, brought this action of trespass to try title to the land in controversy on September 11, 1873, which action was finally decided against him December term, 1888.
“Thereafter the said D. H. Williams conveyed the land in controversy to Eugene Williams, appellant, on March 26, 1889, who on April 1,1889, brought this second action of trespass to try title. The defendants plead not guilty and the statutes of limitations, but do not plead res ad judicata.
“ The court below concluded as matter of law, that whilst the first action of D. H. Williams suspended the statute of limitation, the judgment in that action against D. H. Williams is res ad judicata as to his vendee, Eugene Williams, appellant, on the ground that a plaintiff is entitled to a second action of trespass to try title under the law prior to the Revised Statutes of 1879, if his action was brought prior to 1879, but his vendee, the appellant herein, is not entitled to a second action, but is barred by the first adjudication.
“ The appellant'assigns as error this conclusion of the court as applied to the record in this case; because, first, the defendants do not plead res adjudicata; and second, this conclusion is not the law, since appellant is also entitled to a second action, being the vendee of the plaintiff in the first action.
“ 2. It is admitted that appellant’s title is good from Miguel Rabago, the original grantee, through his only heir, Rosa Musquiz Rabago, who, joined by her husband, Antonio Cortez, conveyed the land to appellant’s vendor, unless the deed from Rabago, by Blanco, to Guillermo Laguerenne, of date City of Mexico, May 25, 1836, is valid.
“If this deed passed the title to Laguerenne, subject to be defeated by any action of the government, the appellant’s title can not be sustained.
“As stated above, unless this deed is an absolute nullity, appellant has no title.
“Appellant claims it is void. If void, the judgment should be reversed and rendered for appellant.
“ Laguerenne was a resident citizen of the City of Mexico and a nonresident alien to Texas on May 25, 1836, when this deed was executed and delivered to him in the City of Mexico.
“ Being a nonresident alien, appellant claims he could neither acquire nor hold title to land, and the sale to him was a nullity and the deed void.
“ The court below concluded that the civil law rule of law was, that a sale to a nonresident alien was a nullity, but this rule did not ‘ apply to the condition of the young Republic,’ and that this deed was valid and passed the title. Appellant assigns as error, the conclusions: first, that a deed to a nonresident alien passed title and was valid on May 25, 1836, whereas such sale was a nullity; second, that the civil law was not applicable to the : condition of the new Republic’ on May 25, 1836; third, that the court confined his conclusion of law to the civil law, finding the civil law rule that such sale was a nullity, but that it did not apply to the new Republic, whereas there were special enactments of Mexico and Texas (declaring this to be the law of the young Republic), of which the court below took no notice in his conclusions, yet which, together with the civil law, was the law governing this question on May 25, 1836.
“ The appellee contends that the sale to Laguerenne was not a nullity, but that, as at common law, a defeasible title passed to him, subject to forfeiture to the State upon inquest of office or like proceeding, which never having been done, leaves the title in Laguerenne’s vendee as an outstanding title.
“ It is agreed the foregoing is a clear and succinct statement of the points of law involved in this record.”
The foregoing agreement and statement of the case is duly signed by the attorneys for the parties.
The first assignment of error by appellant, that the court erred in holding that the vendee of one entitled to bring a second suit in trespass to try title under the law could not maintain the action, in our opinion, ought to be sustained. The right of D. H. Williams to bring his second suit was an assignable right, and passed to his vendee.
The remaining questions in the case are presented by assignment, as follows:
The appellant assigns as error:
“ 2. The finding and judgment of the court that Rabago’s deed to Laguerenne passed title to the latter, whereas Laguerenne was a nonresident alien to Texas, and could neither acquire nor .hold land in Texas, and the sale and deed to him were nullities.
‘13. The finding of the court that the well known doctrine of the civil law (admitted by the court to be that a nonresident alien could neither take nor hold title to land) was not applicable to the condition of the young Republic on May 25, 1836.
“ 4. The failure of the court to pass upon this question of the sale to Laguerenne, as being also governed by the laws of Mexico and Texas, declaring the doctrine of the civil law that such sale was a nullity, and in confining the conclusion of law and basing the judgment of the court alone upon the conclusion that the doctrine of the civil law was not applicable to the conditions of the young Republic.”
By the Constitution of the Republic of Texas, adopted March 17, 1836 (prior to the Laguerenne deed), article 6, schedule, section 1, laws then in force, were continued, as follows:
“That no inconvenience may arise from the adoption of this Constitution, it is declared by this convention, that all laws now in force in Texas, and not inconsistent with this Constitution, shall remain in full force until declared void, repealed, altered, or expire by their own limitation.” Pasch. Dig., 35.
It was also provided in the same Constitution: “ No alien shall hold land in Texas except by titles emanating directly from the government. of this Republic.”
But alien heirs could inherit estate, and were allowed .a reasonable time' in which to take possession and dispose of the same.
What the laws were at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, and while the foregoing provisions were in force, and especially the meaning of the first provision quoted, has been the subject of much learned discussion in the courts, and of conflicting decisions.
The opinion of Chief Justice Hemphill, as expressed in Holliman v. Peebles, 1 Texas, 674, evidently was, that an alien could not acquire land in the Republic of Mexico after the decree of the 12th of March, 1828. He says: “ But whatever maybe the true construction of the laws of Spain or of colonization on the subject matter, there can be no doubt that the capacity of aliens to hold lands in the Republic of Mexico, if it ever existed under the laws of Spain, was extinguished by the decree of the 12th of March, 1828. Ordines y Decretos, vol. 4, p. 155. The sixth article of this decree is expressed in the following terms, viz.: ‘ Foreigners introduced and established in conformity with the regulations prescribed, or which shall hereafter be prescribed, are under the protection of the laws, and enjoy the civil rights conferred by these upon Mexicans, with the exception of acquiring landed rural property, which by existing laws those not naturalized can not obtain.’ The acquisition of real property is not only prohibited, but it is also declared that by the laws then in force it could not be acquired without naturalization. * * * The provisions of this decree are peculiarly stern against the acquisition of lands by foreigners, and subjects, in its eleventh article, all such lands acquired in fraud of the law to denunciation by any Mexican, to whom they shall be adjudged on proof of fraud.” Holliman v. Peebles, T Texas, 719.
The question before the court in the above case was one of alienage of the plaintiffs, upon a plea of alienage set up by defendants, to which the civil law was applied, and the conclusion reached that the plea of alien-age was properly sustained. But it should be noted that that suit was brought in December, 1840, after the common law was adopted in the Republic of Texas.
In Barrett v. Kelly, 31 Texas, 481, it is, in effect, decided, that aliens could acquire land in Texas, subject to be divested according to the laws of Mexico.
In Clay v. Clay, 26 Texas, 31, 32, the question was, could a nonresident alien acquire by purchase land in Coahuila and Texas, or in Mexico, by deed executed in 1830, recognized and approved by the vendor up to the time of his death, in 1835 ? The conclusion of the court was that he could not.
The reasoning of Chief Justice Hemphill, in Holliman v. Peebles, was approved, and the court said: “ We can not err in holding that under the laws of Mexico an alien was incapable of holding real estate.” The court quotes from Escriche a law of the Republic of Mexico, of December, 1835, providing that “the foreigner or alien can not acquire real property in the Republic, unless, having been naturalized, he shall marry a Mexican, and observe moreover that which the law prescribes relative to these acquisitions.” Escriche, word Extranjero, 668. And also cites the sixth article of the decree of March 12, 1828, and construes both laws as prohibiting aliens from acquiring real estate in Texas at the date of the deed mentioned.
This holding was approved in Lacoste v. Odam, 26 Texas, 458.
In Osterman v. Baldwin, 6 Wallace, 116, the Supreme Court of the United States held, that a deed to a citizen in New York to land inTexas, in 1839, conveyed a good title, subject to be defeated only by office found. But if this were not so, it is said, while Texas was a separate Republic, after it was admitted into the Union, the status of the vendee was changed as by naturalization, which had a retroactive effect so as to confirm the title.
The Supreme Court of this State, in Andrews v. Spear, 48 Texas, 567, in construing General Provisions, section 10, of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas, prescribing that “no alien shall hold land in Texas except by titles emanating directly from the government of the Republic,” adhered to the holding in Osterman v. Baldwin, that a deed to an alien was only voidable, and would protect him until some proceeding on the part of the Republic against him. The deed was executed in 1841.
The same doctrine was held by our present Supreme Court in the case of Baker v. Westcott, 73 Texas, 134, where the deed was also executed to the alien in 1841. The court say, that the provision of the Constitution of 1836, General Provisions, section 10, was construed in both the cases above cited, Osterman v. Baldwin and Andrews v. Spear, in which “ it was held, in effect, that a conveyance to an alien during the days of the Republic was subject to be escheated by a proceeding in the nature of office found, at the instance of the government, but that as between the parties to it and their privies it was good.”
The court then concludes, “ that under the conveyance, Westcott, the alien, took a title subject to be escheated at the will of the Republic, and that upon annexation his title became indefeasible.”
The deeds in both of the foregoing Texas cases were made in 1841, after the common law was adopted, which was, on this subject, that an alien could take and hold land by purchase, subject to office found, but could not inherit it or take by implication of law that which the law would escheat on proceeding for that purpose.
The Constitution was paramount, however, and could not be controlled by the common law in case of conflict, and we do not suppose it was allowed to do so iii these cases.
It is contended, that the laws of Mexico prohibited an alien from acquiring or holding land, and that by article 6, schedule, section 1, of the Constitution, these laws were adopted as then understood and administered, until repealed.
This was the effect of the provision, in so far as such laws were not inconsistent with that Constitution nor with public policy. It was not the intention to destroy titles that had matured. McMullen v. Hodge, 5 Texas, 35.
But the question still is, What was the law of Mexico, and of Coahuila and Texas ? And how was that law affected by the alien clause in the Constitution ?
The latest decisions of the Supreme Court of this State, above cited, have given us a construction, and declared that an alien, in so far as such law applied to the condition of things in the Republic, could hold real estate and could have good title until it was divested by the government. Our court is not alone in this construction of the civil law, or of that law as engrafted upon the laws of the Republic of Texas, to 1840.
In the case of Hammekin v. Clayton, 2 Woods, 337, a deed of the 11th of April, 1836, to an alien, was under consideration, and the court, after reviewing the authorities, and especially the tenth general provision of the Constitution of 1836, decided that the deed was not void, and that the better view of the decision of the courts was, that under the Mexican law a deed to an alien vested title, subject to be divested by proceedings by the government for that purpose. The conflict in Holliman v. Peebles, Clay v. Clay, Lacoste v. Odam, with Barrett v. Kelly and Settegast v. Schrimpf (35 Texas, 341), was discussed.
In Phillips v. Moore, 100 United States, 208, the question was whether an alien could take title under a deed to land in Texas, executed in May, 1828. It was held that he could — a defeasible title — subject to the right of the government to have it vacated by some proceeding ascertaining the fact. Here the Texas cases up to Barrett v. Kelly were reviewed, the court holding with that case, and with De Merle v. Mathews, a California case. 26 Cal., 456.
The court say that ‘ ‘ this conclusion is strengthened by the act of the Mexican Congress of the 12th of March, 1828, in relation to passports and the mode of acquiring property by foreigners.”
The court refers to the sixth article of the decree, upon which so much stress is laid by Chief Justice Hemphill in the Holliman case, and continues as follows: ‘ ‘ But yet, the eleventh article of the same act declares that property acquired by unnaturalized foreigners in fraud of the law may be denounced by any Mexican, to whom it will be adjudged as soon as such fraud is proved. It would thus seem that, notwithstanding the prohibitory language of the sixth article, title may pass to a foreigner not naturalized, though it be one which is defeasible upon the denunciation of a private citizen. ’ ’
The fact that proof of fraud in the manner of acquiring was required to enable a private citizen to denounce, is an indication that land sold to an alien did not ipso facto escheat, or return to the public domain.
This is the view taken of the Act of 1828 by the Supreme Court of California, in the case of De Merle v. Mathews, 26 California, 477. “A denouncement,’’ says the court, “was a judicial proceeding, and though real property might be acquired by an alien in fraud of the law — that is, without observing its requirements — he nevertheless retained his right and title to it, liable to be deprived of it by proper proceedings of denouncement, which, in its substantive characteristics, was equivalent to inquest of office found at common law.” Citing Escriche, word “Denuncia,” and several adjudicated cases. See also Racouillat v. Sansevain, 32 Cal., 386.
Delivered November 30, 1892.
We need not prolong the discussion of the question. We think the law is settled, and that it should be now held, as was done in the court below, that the deed to Laguerenne by Rabago conveyed to him and vested in him title to the land, that could be defeated only by some proceeding in the nature of office found, which has never been done; and therefore, according to the submission of the case as agreed, the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed.
Such is the law, as enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States, and latterly by the Supreme Court of this State, sustained by the Supreme Court of California, and not controverted by any courts of last resort, except some early cases in this State, which have been overruled or disregarded by the present Supreme Court.
The question now decided was not directly decided by the Supreme Court of the United States when the case was before that court on error from the judgment in the first suit. It seems the point was misapprehended, and the court declined to reopen the case for further consideration of the question on motion for rehearing, the court being “ satisfied with the conclusion it had reached.” The question was in the case, however, as intimated in the ruling denying a second motion for rehearing, and as appears from the briefs filed in this court on the motion to dismiss the appeal. Williams v. Conger, 125 U. S., 425, and same case on renewal of application for rehearing, 131 U. S., 391.
The judgment of the court below is affirmed.
Affirmed."
219203,Samson Heidenheimer's Executors v. J. F. Walthew,1893-03-09,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellee filed this suit October 24, 1889, in the District Court of Galveston County, against Samson Heidenheimer, on a verbal contract of agency, wherein he alleges, that it was agreed that said Walthew should go to England and there act as the agent of said Heidenheimer in chartering steamships for said Heidenheimer, to be loaded and freighted by him. That said Heidenheimer agreed to pay said Walthew forfiiis said services one-fourth of the profits to be realized upon the loading and freighting of said vessels, and growing out of the chartering thereof. That in pursuance of said contract, said Walthew did charter the steamship Aldersgate at Liverpool, England, on July 3, 1889, on terms satisfactory to said Heidenheimer. That said Heidenheimer loaded said steamer Aldersgate, and made profits in the sum of 86730.80, of which Walthew was entitled to $1682.70, for which he brings suit.
Defendant filed a general demurrer and a general denial. Heidenheimer died pending the suit, and his executors were made parties and defended the action.
On November 7, 1891, case tried by jury, and verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1390.90 principal and $172.58 interest, total $1563.48, and defendants appealed.
Conclusions of fact.—1. That the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that the contract, as alleged, between Heidenheimer and Walthew was proven.
2. After the making of such contract, Heidenheimer entered into a limited partnership with one E. H. Fisher for the purpose of freighting and loading vessels, to which each contributed $5000, with the agreement for an equal division of profits.
3. That Walthew, as alleged by him, chartered and sent to Galveston the Aldersgate for Heidenheimer, and that it was freighted and loaded by E. H. Fisher for the firm of E. H. Fisher & Co., and that the net profits realized therefrom amounted to $5563.62. This sum was divided between Fisher and Heidenheimer, in accordance with their contract of partnership, Heidenheimer receiving $2781.81.
4- That the contract between Heidenheimer and Walthew made Walthew the agent of Heidenheimer, his compensation for his services as such, as agreed on, being one-fourth of the net profits to be realized from the freighting of the vessel.
Conclusions of law.—1. The court did not err in refusing the special charge set forth in appellants’ third assignment of error. The facts there enumerated would not constitute a partnership between Heidenheimer and Walthew. The share of profits allowed Walthew was compensation for his services as Heidenheimer’s agent.
2. The evidence was not sufficient to show such partnership, and the court did not err in refusing the second and third special instructions copied in the fourth and fifth assignments, which stated the effect such a partnership would have upon the rights of the parties.
3. The fourth special instruction asked by appellant, which is as follows, “If the jury believe from the evidence that the partnership of E. H. Fisher & Co. was a special partnership under the statutes, that E. H. Fisher was the general partner and Heidenheimer was a special partner, then Heidenheimer had no authority to bind E. H. Fisher & Co. in any contract, but Heidenheimer Bros, had the right to employ E. H. Fisher & Co., or any other agency, to load the vessels chartered by Heidenheimer and Walthew,” was correctly refused. Heidenheimer had not the right, to the prejudice of Walthew, to admit another to share in the profits of the undertaking. The rights of Walthew, under his contract, were unaffected by the subsequent agreement between Heidenheimer and Fisher.
4. The portion of the charge of the court complained of in the ninth assignment of error properly submitted to the jury, under the evidence, the question as to the proof of the contract as alleged by the plaintiff. Heidenheimer was dead, and Walthew was not allowed to testify as to the contract, but there were facts and circumstances in evidence from which the terms of the agreement could be inferred. The court properly made appellee’s right to recover depend upon proof of such a contract as he alleged.
5. There was no error in refusal of the court to suppress the depositions of Walthew, nor in allowing that of Heidenheimer to be read.
6. The verdict of the jury in finding for plaintiff one-fourth of the profits realized from the freighting of the vessel was correct. The part of the gains allowed by Heidenheimer to Fisher should not have been deducted.
The judgment is therefore affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered March 9, 1893."
219158,Corra B. Foster v. The New York and Texas Land Company,1893-03-09,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Mrs. Foster, plaintiff in error, sued the New York and Texas Land Company, limited, to enforce specific performance of an alleged written contract to convey three sections of land in Galveston County, and joined C. E. Angelí as defendant, averring that he had made a contract to purchase the lands from his codefendant subsequent to the agreement sued on, and with notice of its having been entered into. Prayer was made for specific performance and cancellation of Angelí’s contract; and in the event that for any reason this relief could not be had, plaintiff recover as damages the value of the three sections of land. The cause was tried before a jury, and a verdict and judgment rendered for defendants; and a motion for a new trial being overruled, plaintiff made one assignment of error, and has brought the case here by writ of error.
No questions are raised upon the pleadings, and it is unnecessary to state them.
The documentary evidence offered by plaintiff to establish the contract the enforcement of which is sought consisted of the following letters and telegrams. P. Whitty was the local agent of the land company at Houston, for certain purposes. Ira H. Evans was its president and A. B. Langerman its chief clerk.

“ If there is a chance of much further delay in fixing the maps and field notes, it might be well to ask her to deposit her first payment subject to your order on delivery of the papers; but as it has gone so far now, it may be as well to wait and draw upon her through the bank as soon as the papers are there. I notice that she has advertised in last Sunday’s ‘Post’ 12,000 acres of land at Alvin, at S6 per acre. Mr. Giraud will give you an idea of the character of the Alvin land. God only knows how it may be made habitable. Nevertheless, I think if we don’t close it out at once to Mrs. Foster and Angelí, we can sell it before the end of this year at an advance.
“Yours truly,
“P. Whitty.”
To which Evans replied:
“Austin, Texas, February 5, 1890.
""Mr. P. Whitty, Houston, Texas:
“ Dear Sir—Replying to your favor of yesterday, I have to say, that we expect to be able to send you corrected field notes by the close of this week for all surveys in Galveston County requiring correction.
‘ ‘ Upon return of these field notes, properly signed, we shall be prepared to furnish Mrs. Foster a sketch, by which she can purchase any oi these surveys she may desire to obtain.
“I should not care to have her make a deposit, or to draw a draft upon her through the bank on account of this business, inasmuch as we expect to be prepared so soon to act definitely upon the matter.
“In view of this strawberry boom, it begins to look as if we need not be in any very great haste to push the sale of this land. What do you think of the chance of getting better prices for it ?
“Your remark with respect to this land, ‘ God only knows how it may be made habitable,’ occasions me no little surprise, in view of the fact that when you were proposing to subdivide, you recommended me to buy some of it for a country residence. Will you kindly explain ?
“ Yours truly,
[Signed] “ Ira H. Evans, President.
Subsequently the following correspondence took place:

The plaintiff read in evidence the depositions of Evans and Whitty, setting out the above correspondence, and stating the history of the negotiations and of the sale of the three sections in controversy to Angelí, and the subsequent conveyance of the remaining twenty-two sections to plaintiff.
Plaintiff was then about to proceed further with the introduction of oral testimony, when the trial judge inquired if plaintiff had any more documentary evidence tending to show the existence of the contract; and on being informed in the negative, instructed the jury to find for defendant, plaintiff offering to show by paroi evidence other facts stated in her bill of exceptions.
The substance of the paroi evidence thus introduced and offered by plaintiff, as far as its statement affects our decision, can be more conveniently given in connection with the several points discussed.
It is claimed by plaintiff, that by the letters which passed between Whitty and Langerman of date December 20, December 23, and the telegram of December 27, 1889, with the legitimate paroi evidence introduced and offered, a complete and binding contract is shown for the sale of all of the twenty-five sections of land.
The defendants, on the other hand, contend that the transaction lacks many of the essential qualities of a valid contract for the sale of land, and amount to nothing more than a negotiation.
We think the case may be disposed of by an answer to the question, Was there a distinct offer in writing on one side to sell absolutely, and on the other an unconditional acceptance, sufficient to meet the requirements of the law ?
It may, for the present, be conceded that Langerman’s second letter to Whitty of December 23, 1889, contains an offer to sell the land in controversy sufficient, if properly accepted, to make a binding contract. The first question which then arises is, Must such acceptance have been in writing ?
There is no pretense that Mrs. Foster did accept in writing. Whether an oral acceptance of such an offer is sufficient, is a question about which there is elsewhere a conflict of authority.
The weight of authority is said by elementary writers to be in favor of the affirmative, but it is admitted that there is strong reason and high authority to sustain the opposite view.
We consider that we are concluded by the decision of the Supreme Court of this State in Patton v. Sucker, 29 Texas, 402-408, where it is said: “ In order to their enforcement by the courts, contracts for the sale of lands must be evidenced by writing. Where the writing relied on contains within itself all the particulars of a concluded contract, it is sufficient, if it be signed by the party against whom it is sought to be enforced; but if, instead of being evidence of a concluded agreement, whatever may be its form, it is really a mere proposal, such a writing is turned into an agreement, and can be enforced in equity by the other party only by his acceptance of it in writing.”
This is not in conflict with nor modified by the decisions in the cases of Crutchfield v. Donathon, 49 Texas, 695, and Watson v. Baker, 71 Texas, 747.
The first case was a suit on a note which was a contract complete in itself; and in the last, the offer and acceptance were both in writing. So that the question herein involved was neither, presented nor discussed. These, and the case of Morris v. Gaines, 82 Texas, 255, are based upon facts which show either a writing signed by the party to be charged, evidencing an undertaking complete in itself and not dependent on a subsequent acceptance to conclude the contract, or else an offer made and accepted in writing.
There was no complete contract in this case without acceptance of the offer. The decision in Patten v. Bucker holds, that in such cases the acceptance must be in writing in order to complete the contract. That case involved a discussion and decision of the question, for there was a verbal acceptance of the offer to sell conclusively shown. The court virtually held that insufficient, and then decided that the writing relied on was sufficient. We do not think that the passage which we have quoted can be treated by us as a mere dictum.
But there is a further objection to the alleged acceptance in this case. There was no offer to show that Whitty had any authority to bind the company, and there was positive evidence that he had none. An acceptanee, to bind the company, must therefore have been communicated to those officers who had such authority. The telegram relied on from Whitty to Langerman stated that plaintiff would take the land, agreeably to proposed terms, but referred to a letter, evidently for fuller expression. That letter repeated the statement, that plaintiff was willing to take the land, but added that she wished a sketch of it prepared, to be attached to the contract, and that she would have her first payment ready in about a week; “that is, she wants to take a few days to satisfy herself about the title.” The letter and telegram must be taken together, and must evidence an unconditional acceptance of the offer. Instead of that, they seem to suggest a modification of the terms of the trade, in asking time in which to make a payment which was to be made in cash, and in which to satisfy herself of the soundness of the title. See Corcoran v. White, 117 Ill., 118.
An acceptance, to complete a contract, must be the unconditional and absolute agreement to the very terms of the offer. This letter suggested modifications which necessitated further negotiations and further agreements. This is rendered evident by the reply of the company to this letter, in which the following language occurs: “Before closing this contract, we would like to have Mr. G-iraud’s survey made, and I write to him to-day. I hope we can have him go down there after New Tear. This will also give Mrs. Foster time to have our title investigated. As she wishes to cut up the land into small tracts, we can not afford to make the contract before we know just how our lands lie.”
It appears from the correspondence, that the completion of the contract was deferred on both sides. Mrs. Foster, according to Whitty’s letter, asks for time to satisfy herself about the title, and the company wants to have a survey made before making the contract. It seems to us that the parties up to this point were negotiating, and that their minds did not meet in a binding contract, on the part of the seller to sell, and the buyer to buy, in presentí and unconditionally. The expressions used indicate that they intended to close the trade by a full contract when the necessary preliminaries were settled.
The expression of willingness on the part of Mrs. Foster to take the land may be interpreted, in connection with all the letter contains, to mean that she was willing to so take it when she should have satisfied herself of the title and prepared herself to make the first payment. The company was authorized to put that interpretation on it, and evidently did so.
The obstacle here presented to plaintiff’s right to recover is not merely that she did not perform the contract, but that she did not accede to the proposition in a binding way. The plaintiff, after having introduced these letters in evidence, offered to show, that in her conversation with Whitty she stated that she accepted the offer unconditionally, and did not authorize Whitty or any one to change it, and that knowledge of her acceptance in this manner was brought home to defendant company immediately thereafter. But there was no claim that any other communication was made to the company than the written ones in evidence. But it was stated that there was no other documentary evidence. If there was any evidence in the possession of plaintiff showing such communication, it should, in view of all that had been offered, have been specifically pointed out to the court.
Plaintiff further offered to show on this point, 11 that the defendant company, with the knowledge brought home to its officers at Austin, permitted the plaintiff Mrs. Foster to go ahead and sell portions of the land as belonging to her under this contract, and that she actually made such contracts for sale. That in pursuance of this contract of sale the defendant company ordered a survey of the land to be made, in order to ascertain the exact number of acres embraced in the contract, and for which plaintiff was to pay S3 per acre. * * * That until the completion of the survey and the tender to Mrs. Foster on the 27th day of February, 1890, of the instrument described in appendix B, the defendant company permitted Mrs. Foster to believe that she had contracted for and was to have all the unsold land referred to in the said correspondence, the same embracing the twenty-five sections of land set forth in the exhibit attached to plaintiff’s petition.”
On this point the defendant’s agent, Whitty, testified: “ I handed the letter to Mrs. Foster at the time [referring to the letter No. 2a above]. She stated that she would take the lands on those terms. Nothing was said as to when the first payment was to be made. She came around several times to make inquiries about the land, and as to when the surveys would be completed and when ready. I never told her that any of the twenty-five sections had been sold, because I did not know that any of them had been sold.”
It is contended by plaintiff in error, that these facts were sufficient to show, not only that she had accepted, but that the company knew and recognized the fact, and that this cured any ambiguity which there might have been in the letter as to acceptance. No act of the company is here stated by which permission to sell was given to plaintiff. What it did and what plaintiff did, as represented in the bill of exceptions, is consistent with the contention of either party, and adds nothing to the effect of the alleged acceptance in the telegram and letter.
Our conclusion from the evidence introduced is, that the minds of the parties never in fact met in an agreement to buy and sell, but that the transactions were negotiations, through which they were putting themselves in a condition to conclude a contract. The evidence offered was not sufficient to change this construction, and the court did not err in instructing a verdict for defendants.
It is therefore unnecessary to decide the numerous other questions raised.
Affirmed.
Delivered March 9, 1893.
A writ of error was refused in this case by the Supreme Court, May 15, 1893."
216294,The International & Great Northern Railway Company v. Jourd Campbell,1892-11-30,"KEY, Associate Justice.
Appellee Campbell brought this suit against appellant, the railway company, for damages. The foundation for the action, as charged in appellee’s petition, consisted in an unlawful and wrongful ejection of appellee from a train of cars while he was traveling as a passenger from St. Louis, Missouri, to San Antonio, Texas.
He pleaded a written contract, purporting on its face to be a contract between him and the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company for the shipment of two carloads of live stock from Brackenridge, Texas, to St. Louis, Missouri. The petition alleges that the agent of the last named company, who executed and delivered the contract referred to, was also appellant’s agent, and, in effect, charges that the contract was executed for appellant.
These allegations were not denied under oath, and for this reason the District Court, following Railway v. Tisdale, 74 Texas, 8, held that this contract was binding on appellant.
The contract stipulated, among other things, ""that in consideration of appellee paying $163.20 for the transportation of the two cars of cattle, he was to have free transportation to and from St. Louis for himself. To secure this return transportation free, he was required to present his contract at the office of the connecting railroad at St. Louis within twenty days from its date, and there receive a drover’s pass, which he did. The contract in question also contained the following stipulation:
“And it is further stipulated, agreed, and fully understood by the parties hereto, that in case the live stock mentioned herein is to be transported over the road or roads of any other railroad company, the said party of the first part shall be released from liability of every kind after said live stock shall have left its road, as the party of the first part is only bound for the transportion of said stock to San Antonio station, the end of its line on the route over which said stock is to be shipped; and the party of the second part hereby so expressly stipulates and agrees; the understanding of both parties hereto being that the party of the first part shall not be held or deemed liable for anything beyond the line of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway, excepting to protect the through rate of freight named herein.”
On the back of the contract was the following:
“ We, the undersigned owners, or in charge of the live stock mentioned in the within contract, in consideration of the free pass granted us by the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company, hereby agree that the said San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company shall not be liable to us for any injury or damages of any kind suffered by us while in charge of said stock or on our return passage.
“ Jotjrd Campbell.
“ No cars inside. Pass J. Campbell from Brackenridge to Nat. Stock Yards; parties in charge accompanying stock.
“L. D. Hopkins, Station Master.”
The return pass was issued by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, but the petition alleged that the agent who issued it was also acting foi appellant.
Upon this pass and the contract referred to, appellee was allowed to travel free of charge from St. Louis to Texarkana. He was on the Texas & Pacific Railway when he reached the latter place, and the conductor told him that his pass was not good for 90 miles of the road to be traveled immediately after passing Texarkana, and that he would have to pay fare for this 90 miles. This appellee refused to do, and the conductor called in a policeman and compelled him to get off the train at Texarkana after midnight, in the rain, etc. This all occurred on the Texas & Pacific Railway, and not on the International & Great Northern Railroad, which, it was shown, terminated at Longview, a considerable distance from Texarkana.
The trial court instructed the jury, that if they found for the plaintiff, to allow him such actual damages as he was shown by the testimony to have sustained by his unlawful ejection from the train; that this would include such sums of money as he was necessarily compelled to expend in completing his journey to San Antonio, necessary hotel bills, and compensation for loss of time; and that if they found that appellee’s expulsion from the train was not only wrongful, but was accomplished in a rude or insulting manner and under circumstances calculated to mortify and humiliate him, and if in fact he was thereby humiliated and mortified, then the jury might allow him fair and reasonable compensation for the injury done him by reason of the outrage and indignity so inflicted upon him. The charge, however, clearly limited the right of recovery to actual damages.
The jury returned a verdict for appellee for $750.
It is contended by appellant that the doctrine announced in Harris v. Howe, Receiver, etc., 74 Texas, 534, and Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. Baird, 75 Texas, 256, and since adhered to by repeated decisions of our Supreme Court, to the effect that a common carrier may limit its liability to such losses and injuries as occur on its own line, applies to this case; and that, as the injury was occasioned upon another railroad than appellant’s, by the terms of the contract it is not liable.
The allegation in appellee’s petition that the contract attached to and made part thereof was executed by or in behalf of appellant, not being denied under oath, renders it, in law, its contract.
It is, therefore, to be construed as if the name International & Great-Northern Railway Company was substituted for the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Bail way Company wherever the latter appears in the contract; but those provisions thereof which enure to appellant’s benefit, and which could lawfully be made, are to be enforced, as well as those that are benficial to appellee.
Appellant could not lawfully contract for immunity from loss of or injury to the property shipped, or injury to appellee, occasioned by the wrongful act or omission of appellant or its servants while on the line of its railroad; but it could, and if a party to the contract, it did, stipulate for its nonliability for any such wrongful act or omission of any other common carrier, except that it agreed to protect the through rate of freight, and to furnish appellee free transportation to and from St. Louis; and this it was bound to do for the entire distance.
Under the facts disclosed by the record (there being no verified plea denying averments of agency in appellee’s petition), we think he was a passenger on the Texas Pacific Bail way on the occasion in question; that because of the refusal of the conductor to allow him to remain on the train at Texarkana without paying fare, there was a breach of appellant’s contract to furnish him free transportation to and from St. Louis; and that as a result of this breach of contract he.is entitled to recover such sum of money, and no more, as will compensate him for money necessarily paid out for railroad fare and hotel bills, and for loss of time, which money would not have been paid out, and time lost, but for the breach of the contract.
The claim for damages as compensation for mental suffering (mortification and humiliation of mind), caused by the rude or insulting manner of the conductor who put appellee off the train, can not be maintained as against appellant. This injury does not flow from a mere breach of the contract, but arises out of and rests upon the rude and wanton manner in which the contract was broken. The mere failure to comply with the agreement was not a tort, but the wanton and insulting conduct of the conductor at the time was; and it was upon this tort that appellee based and maintained, in the court below, his demand for compensation for wounded feelings. Railway v. Roemer, ante, 191.
Against this latter claim, appellant is protected by the terms of the contract invoked and relied upon by appellee.
Giving to this contract the most favorable construction it can be susceptible of in behalf of appellee, it must be held to exempt appellant from liability for injury to either his person or feelings, when such injury did not occur upon either its own road or the San Antonio & Aransas Pass road.
Delivered November 30, 1892.
It is proper to say that this case was tried in the court below before the decision in Harris v. Howe, supra, was rendered; and the record indicates that the defense urged in this court, under the principle enunciated in that case, was not relied on as strenuously as it is here.
The judgment of the District Court will be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded."
216293,"Thomas Dwyer v. B. H. Bassett, Surviving Partner",1892-12-01,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
This is the second appeal prosecuted by the defendant in this case from the judgment of the lower court. The decision upon the former appeal is reported in 63 Texas, 274-286. The appellee has upon this appeal also assigned error, which he asks to be considered, in case the appeal by the defendant be sustained.
The first assignment of error is to the judgment sustaining the plaintiff’s exceptions to the defendant’s plea to the jurisdiction of the court, but as the transcript does not contain the exceptions to the plea, we are unable to determine whether there be error or not in the judgment sustaining the exceptions. Under such circumstances we must presume that the exceptions were correctly sustained. Every intendment is in favor of the ruling of the court.
The second and third assignments impugn the action of the court in permitting the plaintiff, over defendant’s objection, to read in evidence from a statement of the facts, made up by the attorneys and approved by the judge, upon the former appeal of this case, what purported to be the testimony of the deceased witnesses Jefferson Bassett and George B. Robertson. The plaintiff having proved the death of these witnesses, and having next proved by counsel for the defendant that the testimony of these witnesses, given on the former trial, was, in substance, the same as that found in the statement of facts, the court, over the objection of the defendant, that the testimony of a deceased witness can not be reproduced by reading from a statement of facts, agreed to and approved by the judge-presiding, for the purposes of an appeal, permitted the plaintiff to read the testimony, and in this we think there was no error. Whart. Ev., secs. 177, 24; Davis v. Klein, 9 S. W. Rep., 724, 725. In the case cited by counsel for appellant in support of his objections to the testimony, the case of Dwyer v. Rippetoe, 72 Texas, 522, 523, there was no proof of the correctness of the statement of facts from which it was proposed to read the testimony of a deceased witness.
Neither the counsel for plaintiff or defendant, nor the judge who tried the case, could say that the testimony of the deceased witness was correctly reported in the statement of facts from which counsel proposed to read.
■ The court, we think, committed an error in admitting in evidence, over the objection of appellant, that portion of the testimony of the witness Bassett in which the witness relates a conversation between himself and his cashier, relative to the amount of money paid to witness by defendant, such conversation having been had several hours after the payment had been made, and at a time when the defendant was not present; such testimony, we think, is clearly hearsay, and should not have been admitted.
We know of no rule of law under which this conversation could be held to be evidence in this case. The position of counsel for appellee, that the conversation was a part of the res geste, and therefore legitimate, is not, in our opinion, tenable. The conversation between the witnesses Bassett and Robertson, had in the afternoon, consisted of declarations by the former, “ narrative” of what occurred in the morning when the money was paid him by the defendant, and questions put and suggestions made to him by Robertson. No part of this conversation, as we think, can be said to be a declaration evoked by and explanatory of the transaction had by the witness Bassett with the defendant, and therefore can not be any part of the res gestee. We are not able to say that this conversation did not have weight with the jury. What weight this testimony may have had we know not, and the case must therefore be reversed and remanded.
The objection of the appellant to the charge of the court which explains to the jury what is meant by the expression “ weight of evidence,” is not good, in our judgment. The explanation of the term is correct, and we can not say that the instruction should not have been given.
The appellant’s sixth and last assignment of error we do not care to discuss. Upon the trial of this cause, the plaintiff’s counsel, having previously interrogated the defendant as to the payment of money made by him to H. C. McIntyre, Jr., about the first of October, 1883, the day preceding the transaction with the plaintiff, and a payment made by him to N. E. Dever, the sheriff of Washington County, in December, 1884, proposed to prove by these witnesses the following facts: By witness McIntyre, that the defendant was indebted to the Houston & Texas Central Railway Company on a bill of freight amounting to about $200, and that defendant came into the office of witness, he being the agent for the railway, and placed upon witness’ desk a roll of money, which defendant averred contained $200, but which, in fact, contained only $180; that witness discovered the shortage after the defendant had left the office, but before he had finished taking his freight from the depot, and witness immediately called on the defendant and demanded that he make good the shortage, which defendant did after some hesitation. Several persons were present when this occurred, and in their presence the witness counted the money; that witness was busy at the time the roll of money was placed with him by defendant, and defendant was also in a hurry in making the payment and hauling off his freight. By the witness Dever, that in December, 1884, in making payment of a lot of goods sold to him by witness at attachment sale, the purchase amounting to over $2000, defendant tendered to witness four packages of money which he represented to con-1500 each; said tender was made late in the evening, and at a time when witness was very busy winding up the sales and other transactions of the day, and matters were in some confusion. Upon counting up the bills in said packages, one of them was found to contain only $380, to-wit, 38 bills of $10 each. The other three packages contained each $500. Upon witness calling defendant’s attention to the fact that there was a deficit of $120 in one of the packages, he stated in explanation that one of his boys had taken out of the package some money to pay for some cotton, and that he (defendant) had forgotten the circumstance. This evidence, when offered by plaintiff, was objected to by defendant, on the ground that the same was incompetent and irrevelant, and not proper matter of cross-examination or impeachment, and the objections were sustained and all of the evidence excluded, to which ruling of the court the plaintiff excepted, and upon appeal assigns the exclusion of this evidence as error.
Delivered December 1, 1892.
The object of plaintiff’s suit is not only to recover the alleged balance due plaintiff from defendant, but also to recover exemplary damages for the alleged fraud and deceit practiced upon plaintiff by defendant; and to sustain the charge of fraud, plaintiff must not only show by a preponderance of evidence that the roll of notes delivered to him contained less money than the defendant represented it to contain, but it must be further proved that defendant knew his representation so made to plaintiff to be false, and that it was made for the purpose of deceiving and defrauding the plaintiff. While the excluded evidence was not admissible to show that the roll contained less than $1000, if this fact be established by other evidence then the excluded evidence would be admissible as tending to show that defendant knew that to be a fact when he delivered the roll, and falsely represented it to contain $1000. We think the rule is well established, that when scienter and motive are involved, it is competent to show the commission of a series of similar acts by the defendant who is charged with guilty knowledge or fraudulent intent.
The judgment of the lower court is reversed, and the cause remanded for another trial, in accordance with the rules of law enunciated in this opinion.
JReversed and remanded.

216192,W. H. Randolph and Wife v. John Junker et al.,1892-12-01,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
Action of trespass to try title to recover an undivided interest of five-twenty-fourths in the south half of the Mumford House league and labor of land, situated in De Witt County, Texas, brought by appellant Shela Randolph, joined by her husband, W. H. Randolph. Plaintiffs claim the land in the separate right of Mrs. Randolph to one-sixth thereof as the heir of- her mother, Matilda House, the deceased wife of Mumford House, and one-twenty-fourth thereof as the heir of her deceased brother, Travis House.
Defendants claim title to the land under a deed of conveyance from Mumford House to W. R. Baker, made after the death of Matilda House, and say that they had no knowledge of Mrs. House or the plaintiffs, or that they had any interest in the land. Also, that after his conveyance to Baker, Mumford House settled with his daughter, Shela Randolph, for her mother’s interest in the land in controversy, by conveyance to her of other real and personal property.
The case was tried by the court without a jury, and judgment was rendered for the defendants. No conclusions of fact and of law were filed by the court below.
1. Mumford House and Matilda McCurly were married prior to 1836, and lived together as husband and wife until 1847, when the wife died. She left as her sole heirs the three children of herself and her said husband, to-wit, Joe M., Travis, and Shela. Travis died without issue, intestate, in the year 1861. Shela married plaintiff W. H. Randolph in January, 1857. Mumford House married again, and died in 1882, leaving children by his second wife.
2. The land in controversy is an undivided interest of five-twenty-fourths in the south or lower half of one league and one labor, situated in De Witt County, Texas, patented to Mumford House, his heirs and assigns, on December 8, 1847. The patent contains no mention of the certificate and no recital that it was issued to House as the head of a family. A certificate was issued to House as the head of a family for one league and one labor of land, dated March 2,1838, by the Board of Land Commissioners of Harris County; and on October 9, 1845, a duplicate certificate was issued to him on proof of loss of the certificate issued March 2, 1838.
3. January 17, 1846, Mumford House made a contract in writing with John York to “clear out” his “lieadright league and labor” on halves, and to receive a patent from the Land Office for the same. Said contract was recorded in the record of deeds for De Witt County, July 24, 1854.
4. December 24, 1854, Mumford House executed power of attorney to R. House to convey one-lialf of the league and labor to York’s heirs. The instrument recited, “that whereas John York in his lifetime did locate in De Witt County for me one league and labor of land, to which I was entitled as a colonist under the Mexican Government,” and proceeded to authorize the conveyance. It was recorded in the record of deeds for De Witt County, June 2, 1855.
5. Mumford House, by his attorney in fact, R. House, conveyed by metes and bounds one-half of said league and labor to the heirs of John York, which, though not designated as such, was the upper or north half. This deed is dated January 11, 1855, and was recorded in the record of deeds for De Witt County on June 2, 1855. It contained the following recital: “ Containing one-lialf of the survey of one league and labor patented to me as a colonist under the Mexican Government.”
6. On June 30, 1857, Mumford House conveyed to W. R. Baker, for consideration of 85000 cash, as expressed in deed, but an actual consideration of land in Ellis County exchanged therefor, one-half of the following described league and labor of land: “Being the south or lower half, and the half not heretofore conveyed to one York, situated on the back lines of the surveys on the Guadalupe, about 23 miles northwest of Victoria, and granted to Mumford House by patent No. 177, volume 7, dated December, A. D. 1847, said land lying on Five Mile Creek; and for a more full description said patent is made a part of this deed. ’ ’ There is no covenant of seisin contained in the deed, and the warranty is limited to those claiming “by or through” the grantor, being a special warranty deed. It was recorded in De Witt County, November 14,1873; but the record is only partial, there being some portions of the deed omitted. No authority in House to sell his wife’s community interest after her death was shown by proof of administration or of community debts.
7. On October 29, 1873, W. R. Baker conveyed to D. B. Peavy as follows: “The south or lower half, and the half not sold by Mumford House to one York, of one league and labor of land granted by the State of Texas to Mumford House by patent No. 177, volume 7, dated December 8, 1847, and conveyed by M. House to Baker by deed dated June 30, 1857, which deed and patent are herewith delivered and made part of this deed, and reference is made to them for full description.” This deed was duly recorded November 14, 1873.
8. Defendants Junker and others bought their respective tracts from Peavy at various dates subsequent to his purchase from Baker.
9. When Baker bought the land from House he did not know whether House was a married man, or the head of a family, or not, and had no knowledge of his having had a wife who was déad, nor of any children by such wife. Nor did Peavy nor any of the defendants ever have knowledge that Mumford House was or had been a married man, or the head of a family, or that his wife was dead, or of the existence of the plaintiff, until the institution of this suit.
10. In the year 1861, Mumford House gave his three children by the said Matilda each 200 acres of land out of the land in Ellis County which he received from W. R. Baker in exchange for the land in controvery, also 100 head of cattle, 25 head of horses, and to Mrs. Randolph a negro boy, which he considered equal to their interest in the De Witt County land, in settlement of said interest; but the deed to Mrs. Randolph was not executed until 1870, on account of the pendency of some legal proceedings about the Ellis County land. Afterward Mrs. Randolph, joined by her husband, sold and conveyed the 200 acres that she received to one W. C. Stalworth.
11. The deed from Mumford House to Mrs. Randolph for the land conveyed to her recited that it was in consideration of love for his daughter, and concluded with the recital, “it being her distributive share of my real estate.” Mrs. Randolph never executed any deed or release to her father, nor to any one else, for any interest to the land in controversy, in consideration of such settlement, nor for any other consideration.
1. We find, upon the authority of Hill v. Moore, 62 Texas, 610, that the size of the survey granted to Mumford House, being one league and labor, was sufficient to put the vendees of said House upon notice of the equitable rights of the wife of said House in the land, because a league and labor of land could only be granted to the head of a family, and the head of a family implied marriage and a wife. This being true, the defendants would have to take notice of every other fact necessary to protect the interest of Mrs. Randolph, as the death of her mother, and her consequent heirship.
It will not be necessary to inquire whether the defendants would be bound by the recitals in the deeds and other instruments in the York title, as we have held that the size of the grant itself is sufficient to give notice of the equitable interest of Mrs. Randolph in the land. Although these instruments were collateral to the chain of title under which the appellants claimed, it was contended by them- that the recital in the deed to W. R. Baker by Mumford House, that he conveyed the “half not heretofore conveyed to one York,” and did not convey by metes and bounds, while the York deed was by metes and bounds, directed the defendants to the deed to York, which would have shown that the land was patented to House as a colonist.
2. For the purpose of showing a settlement by Mumford House with the plaintiff Mrs. Randolph, for her interest in her mother’s estate, defendants were permitted to put in evidence a deed to M. and W. R. House for the land in Ellis County; the petition in partition suit of House v. Beauchamp, administrator of W. R. House; deed from M. House to Shela Randolph; deed from Shela Randolph and husband, W. H. Randolph, to N. C. Stalworth; and the testimony of Jo. M. House and W. A. House, which were admitted over the objections of the plaintiffs, substantially that:
(1) Defendants as privies of M. House were estopped froln denying the recital in the deed from M. House to Shela Randolph, showing the purpose of the deed.
(2) Because there being no covenant of seisin in the deed from House to Baker, and the warranty being restricted to a special warranty, the after-acquired title of House by virtue of the settlement would not enure to the benefit of the defendants.
(3) That if any title passed to House by virtue of the settlement, it was an equitable title, with which the defendants did not connect themselves.
(4) It was not shown that the defendants relied on the settlement.
(5) Mrs. Randolph being a married woman, could not be estopped without fraud on her part, which was not shown.
(6) That the settlement was in conflict with article 548, Revised Statutes, and statutes regulating conveyances by married women.
We do not think there was any error in the admission of the evidence. The defendants were not bound by the recital in the deed from House to his daughter, that the land was her distributive share of his real estate. Evidence was admissible to show what the transaction really was. Howard v. Davis, 6 Texas, 174; Hicks v. Morris, 57 Texas, 661.
Mrs. Randolph owned an equitable interest in the land, and her father held the legal title for the benefit of himself and the heirs of his wife, subject to the community obligations. In such cases it has been uniformly held in this State, that without administration the survivor may sell the real estate belonging to the community estate for the purpose of discharging the debts against the community. But if the survivor sells the community property without authority, the heirs of the deceased parent would be entitled to recover one-half, less the value of such property as they had received from such surviving parent. Taken in connection with the evidence that the conveyance by Mumford House to Mrs. Randolph was in settlement of her interest in the community estate of her mother in the De Witt County land, such conveyance was in discharge of House’s obligation to the community incurred by the sale of the land.
Delivered December 1, 1892.
The conveyance to Mrs. Randolph would be prima facie in discharge of such obligation. Sparks v. Spence, 40 Texas, 694; Belcher v. Fox, 60 Texas, 527; Burleson v. Burleson, 28 Texas, 418.
Although the defendants took the conveyance of land with constructive notice of the plaintiff’s equitable interest as an heir of Mrs. House, still she will not be permitted to retain the proceeds of the settlement for that interest and recover the same of the defendant without restoration of such proceeds, notwithstanding the fact that it may not have been conveyed in the manner prescribed by the statute in which a married woman should convey her property. Our decisions on the subject are all to the effect, that whenever the heirs of the deceased partner of the marital partnership have received property amounting to their share of the property belonging to the community estate, their equitable title to the remainder stands discharged. We do not think it is a question of estoppel, in which it would be necessary to show fraud on the part of Mrs. Randolph in order to invoke the principle, but it is rather a settlement by the trustee of the legal title with the cestui que trust for her equitable interest therein.
Although the vendee, Baker, took the legal title of House, charged with the equitable interest of Mrs. Randolph, the settlement with Mrs. Randolph discharged the land of this equity, and it enured to the benefit of House’s vendees. If the doctrine of after-acquired title should be held to be involved, that is now settled in this State against the contention of appellants. Lindsay v. Freeman, 83 Texas, 263. The deed of House to Baker, and the subsequent conveyance by him to appellees’ vendor, was sufficient to connect them with whatever equity House may have acquired.
The one-twenty-fourth interest claimed by Mrs. Randolph as the heir of her brother Travis, would attach to the property received by him in the settlement with his father, and not to the land in controversy.
We are of the opinion that there was no error in the record, and the judgment of the court below will be affirmed.
Affirmed.
Justice Pleasants did not sit in this ease."
216187,"B. F. Yoakum et al., Receivers, v. J. B. Dunn",1892-12-01,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
Action for damages, brought March 31, 1891, in the District Court of Fayette County, by appellee, against appellants as receivers of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company, for injury to a museum delivered to the defendants for shipment to Dallas, Texas, for exhibition at the State Fair in October, 1890; and also for loss of profits in the exhibition of the museum by reason of the failure of defendants to transport and deliver the same.
Trial was had by a jury on June 6, 1891, and verdict and judgment were m favor of the plaintiff.
Appellants assign as error the refusal of the court to give in his charge to the jury the following instruction requested by them: “You are hereby charged that under the facts in this case the plaintiff can not recover for mental anguish, and in assessing your damage,"" if you find from the evidence that he is entitled to any, you will not take this into consideration.”
In his petition appellee stated the damages resulting from the failure of the defendants to transport the museum expeditiously, and to have the same at Dallas at the opening of the fair, to be, that he""“ lost all opportunity to make money at said point by exhibiting his said collection of birds, animals, etc., and lost his own time, besides the expense of keeping and paying his employes in the city of Dallas, and his trouble, vexation, and worry.” There was no special exception addressed to the element of damage last stated, and the plaintiff testified, without objection, that he experienced great mental anxiety on account of the delay of the museum. It is stated in the brief of appellants that counsel for plaintiff read cases to the court, in the hearing of the jury, wherein it was held that mental anguish was a proper element of damages, but this has not been brought to our attention in such a manner that we can take notice of it. However, we think, under the circumstances, that the court should have given the instruction requested, as the jury may have been influenced in their verdict by the allegation and testimony as to the mental anguish.
The evidence does not show that the museum was ever out of the possession of the defendants, and it was last in their possession and was received from them at Muldoon; hence it was not error for the court to refuse the requested instruction requiring the plaintiff to show upon what line of railway the damage was done to the property, nor to give the instruction that under the undisputed evidence the plaintiff was entitled to recover.
Appellee was permitted to testify on the trial, over the objection of the appellants, as shown by their bill of exception, that it took him ten years to collect the various specimens in his museum, and that liis services were worth $1000 a year. The objection to this evidence, that the value of the museum, or the damage thereto, could not be measured by the time devoted to the preparation or acquisition of the specimens composing it by the plaintiff, was well taken; for the measure of damage for the injury to the specimens would be the market value of such as might have been destroyed, and the difference in value of such specimens as may have been partially injured, just before the injury and just after. If the articles destroyed or injured had no market value at Muldoon, then the market value of such articles at the nearest place where they had a market value should be shown. If it should be shown by the evidence that the specimens had no market value, then it would be proper to show what they could be replaced or repaired for. It is very probable that the specimens composing the plaintiff’s museum had no market value in Muldoon, Payette County, but we have no doubt but that there are places where such specimens could be bought, and that there are persons who could furnish them at an expense which could be approximately estimated. It certainly would not be admissible to show how much time and labor it cost plaintiff to gather them, when from various causes he may have expended more upon them than it would take to replace them, or than they would be worth in the market where they could be had.
The charge of the court, that the articles had no general market value, was clearly error as upon the weight of the evidence. While there was some testimony that they had no market value, still the evidence as to the nature of the articles, and the manner of their collection and preparation, tended to show that they were all such specimens as might have a market value.
The third division of the charge, to the effect that the depreciation in value of the articles not injured, caused by injury to other articles, submitted an element of damages too speculative and uncertain; because such injury or depreciation could only result from a general lessening of interest in the museum by reason of the loss of certain specimens, there being no evidence to show any other dependence of the articles on each other for value than such as would go to make up a whole collection. As before stated, the proper measure of damages would be the injury to each article.
When plaintiff delivered his museum to the defendants for shipment to Dallas, he notified their agent of the purpose for which it was being shipped, and such notice was given as would render the defendants liable for such special damage as he might probably sustain by reason of the failure to have the museum there for exhibition, in the way of lost profits therefrom. Such special damage was alleged in the petition, and the plaintiff testified in support thereof; and upon this issue the court charged the jury as follows: “ In estimating the damage resulting from the failure of the defendants to ship the museum to the town of Dallas, you will consider the reasonable expenses the evidence may show the plaintiff has incurred for himself and his employes in going to and returning from Dallas, and during the time he remained in Dallas awaiting the arrival of the museum shipped. The plaintiff is also entitled to recover whatever net profits the evidence shows he may have earned by the exhibition of the said museum, if it had been transported without delay and with due expedition, according to agreement.”
Appellants contend that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the probable net profits of an exhibition of the museum at the Dallas fair, because they would be too speculative and uncertain. Perhaps he would not be entitled to recover them as net profits, but he would be entitled to recover for the value of the use of the property at such place and time, and such value could not be more properly determined than by ascertaining what the probable net profits of the exhibition would have been. In the charge complained of, the court having directed the jury that plaintiff was entitled to recover the reasonable expenses incurred for himself and employes, as well as the net profits of the exhibition, he should have then defined net profits; because the expenses of the trip to Dallas and board there would have been expenses attending the exhibition, and if plaintiff should recover them eo nomine, as already having been paid out, they should be deducted, with the other expenses, from the gross receipts.
The admission of the evidence of W. L. Moore, that the plaintiff had refused to sell the collection, was error.
By the Act of 1889, amending sections 2 and 6 of the Act of 1887, all moneys that come into the hands of a receiver are made subject, among other obligations, “ to the payment of all claims and accounts against the receiver on contracts made by the receiver during the receivership.” The suit of plaintiff grows out of a claim on a contract to safely transport the plaintiff’s property to Dallas, as stipulated in a bill of lading. Authority to sue the receiver is granted by the statute, and the Act of 1889 makes “all judgments rendered against a receiver on causes of action arising during the receivership ” a lien on all the property in his hands, superior to the mortgage lien. Plaintiff had authority under the statute to sue the receivers upon the cause of action as stated by him.
Delivered December 1, 1892.
The application for a continuance failed to show what the facts were that constituted due diligence in ascertaining the defense; and it also might have shown that defendants’ counsel informed the sheriff, when he placed the subpoena in his hands, where the witness could be found, as it showed that the witness was a transient person, then temporarily to be found in Fayette; but as the case must be reversed for other errors, we do not pass on the sufficiency of the application further than as indicated, and do not base the reversal on it.
For the errors indicated, the judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded."
216241,Mary Luck v. B. L. Zapp et al.,1892-12-01,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
This action was brought by appellant against appellee Zapp, as sheriff of Fayette County, and the other appellees as sureties on his official bond, to recover damages caused by alleged wrongful acts of Zapp’s deputy.
The petition charged in substance that the deputy, in his official capacity, wrongfully and maliciously ejected plaintiff from her house, by virtue of some pretended writ, and carried her household goods out of the house, and dispossessed her of her home.
The case was tried before a jury, and, after the introduction of evidence had concluded, the presiding judge instructed the jury that the plaintiff had not established the allegations in her petition, and directed them to find for defendant.
In what particular the judge regarded the evidence as insufficient is not made to appear from the record. It is contended by appellees that the acts of the deputy sheriff, shown by the evidence, did not belong to that class for which his principal would be responsible, and we infer, from the briefs of both parties, that this view was taken by the trial court.
We gather from the evidence that appellant owned the house referred to in the petition, and was living in it when the acts complained of took place. She had some months before sold the land on which it stood to another person, reserving the house and the right to remove it at any time within two years from the date of the deed. Appellees controverted the fact, asserted by her, that the house was her homestead, but it is sufficient to say upon this point, that the evidence was not such as to warrant the court in assuming, as matter of law, that she was not entitled to it as her homestead, free from forced sale for debt. That she could acquire a homestead right in such property is decided in Cullers & Henry v. James, 66 Texas, 494.
Sometime in March, 1889, one W. T. Rhodes, a deputy of Zapp, claiming to act in his official capacity as such deputy, levied upon the house by virtue of some writ, which is referred to in the answer of appellees and in the evidence as an execution issued from a Justice Court. Its nature is not further shown.
About the 4th of April, the deputy went to the house, where appellant then was, and commanded her to get out of it; and upon her refusal to do so, put her out, carried all of her goods from the house, nailed it up, and thus deprived her of its possession. The deputy, while thus acting, asserted that he was doing so by virtue of his authority as deputy sheriff, and that he had a good bond behind him. Between the time of the levy and the dispossession of appellant, and also after the latter transaction, Zapp was notified of his deputy’s acts, was told that the house was appellant’s homestead, and was appealed to to release the levy, and, afterward, to restore appellant to the possession of the property. At one time he said he knew nothing about it; that it was from the Flatonia department; that it originated from a Justice Court. At another time, when fully informed as to what his deputy had done, and appealed to to undo it, he replied, that he knew nothing of the proceedings as far as the writ was concerned; that he would not do it; that the other side intended to fight it, and would protect him. The deputy testified on the stand that he acted in his official capacity of deputy sheriff. Appellant offered to prove by him the nature and contents of the writ under which he acted, but this was excluded by the court, on objection being made by appellees.
If the property was appellant’s homestead — and the evidence would at least warrant the conclusion that it was — it was not subject to levy; and in such case, the acts done by the deputy in dispossessing appellant were clearly wrongful.
Had it been shown that these acts had been done by the sheriff himself, acting under color of his office, a prima facie case would have been made against him and his sureties, and the burden would have been cast upon him to justify them.
In seeking to fix upon him liability for the acts of his deputy, the appellant was required only to show that the wrongful act complained of was one which the deputy might, under proper circumstances, do as an officer, and that it was in fact done under color or by virtue of his official station.
Delivered December 1, 1892.
Says the Supreme Court of Massachusetts: “If the act from which the injury resulted was an official act, the authorities are clear that the sheriff is answerable; if it was not an official, but a personal act, it is equally clear that he is not answerable. But an official act does not mean what a deputy might lawfully do in the execution of his office; if so, no action could ever lie against the sheriff for the misconduct of his deputy. It means, therefore, whatever is done under color or by virtue of his office.” Knowlton v. Bartlett, 1 Pick., 278; Murf. on Sheriffs, sec. 60.
The deputy was the general agent of the sheriff (Murfree on Sheriffs, section 75), and it was his duty to determine, as a guide to conduct in the execution of the writ which he held, the scope of the authority which it conferred, and the nature of the action which it enjoined or authorized. His determination of those questions, and his acts done in pursuance of it, were the exercise of official authority conferred upon him by his principal, and the latter was responsible for them.
It was not necessary for the plaintiff to produce the writ under which the deputy proceeded. That he acted by virtue of his office could be shown by parol evidence. Murf. on Sheriffs, sec. 943.
We think the evidence, as we have stated it, showed that the deputy was acting officially, and was sufficient to entitle plaintiff to have the cause submitted to the jury.
The court below did not err in excluding parol evidence of the contents of the writ, but it was legitimate for plaintiff to show by parol that the deputy was assuming to act under an execution.
The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded."
219249,W. R. Baker's Executors v. Julia W. Clark,1893-03-09,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
The law applicable to this case is-that announced in the opinion rendered in the case of W. R. Baker’s Executors v. Isa R. De Freese, ante, page 524. The defense in each case is the same, and the facts are very similar. This suit is an action of trespass to try title, brought by W. R. Baker’s executors, to recover from defendant certain lots described in the petition, and situated in the city of Houston. The defendant answered by general denial; and plead specially, that the property sued for was donated to her in 1882 by her deceased brother, W. R. Baker, the plaintiffs’ testator, and that her said brother placed defendant in possession of the premises in the same year; that the lots were purchased by her brother for her, and the title taken in his name in trust for her in 1881; and in 1882 her said brother erected a dwelling upon them, and then donated both the lots and dwelling upon them to defendant; and that he ever afterwards regarded defendant as the owner of the property and vested with the absolute title thereto, and that he made this declaration at various times, and to various persons, and that he made such declaration but a few days before his death in 1890; that defendant had occupied the lots as her home continuously since 1882, and claimed the same as her property; and that in consequence of the gift of the property by her brother to her, she had made large and valuable improvements upon the same, and that said improvements were made with the full knowledge of her brother, and that she was making the same upon the belief that she was the real owner of the property, and that he made no objections to her making the improvements. She averred her improvements were of the value of $5000. She averred that she would not have made such improvements if she had not believed that the property was hers. Defendant further averred, that by reason of all the above facts, plaintiffs were estopped from claiming said property; and she prayed that plaintiffs take nothing by their suit, and for specific performance of the said donation by decree of the court, and that she be quieted in her title and possession.
Plaintiffs, by supplemental'petition, denied that the improvements made by defendant added anything to the value of the property, and averred that the improvements were only such as contributed to the comfort and convenience of the defendant, and such as any conscientious tenant would place upon land occupied by him. And plaintiffs further averred, that the lots in controversy were never given to defendant; that they were improved by Baker for the purpose of allowing defendant to occupy the same at his pleasure; that Baker was a cautious, prudent, and methodical business man, and well read in the land laws of Texas; and that during all the time the premises were occupied by defendant the property was assessed in his (Baker’s) name, and the taxes thereon paid by him, and that the property was also insured by Baker in his name, and the premiums paid by him; that the rental value of the property was $50 per month, and that during all the time defendant occupied the premises Baker paid her monthly $150, which sum was more than sufficient to compensate defendant for any outlay made by her in improvements, and for any labor and care bestowed by her in improving and preserving the premises.
Defendant, by supplemental answer, denied the allegation of plaintiffs’ supplemental petition, and averred, that if the property was insured by Baker, and if he paid the taxes thereon, it was done by him as her agent, and for her use and benefit, and that the said Baker did not intend thereby to assert any right to the property, but only intended thereby to protect the defendant in her title and ownership of the same.
The cause was tried on May 21, 1891, and verdict and judgment were rendered for the defendant, and plaintiffs appealed.
The evidence of the purchase and improvement of the lots by Baker for the defendant, and his donation of the same to her, and his placing her in possession of the premises, and her continued occupancy of the same, and Baker’s frequent and continuous admission that the property was the defendant’s, and that he had bought it and improved it for her and had given it to her, that he had no claim on it, was full and convincing.
The improvements made by the defendant (and their nature and character show that many of them were permanent and valuable), and that they were made with the knowledge of and without objection by the said Baker, were also established by the evidence. The value of all the improvements was shown to be about $2000.
Plaintiffs proved that Mr. Baker was a careful and prudent man of business, and that he assessed the property in his name and paid the taxes thereon, and that he insured the house upon the lots in his name, and described them as occupied by a tenant, and paid the premiums himself; and that he also insured the property in the house in the name of the defendant, and also paid the insurance himself; and the rental value of the premises was shown to be in excess of the improvements from $300 to $500 for the eight years they were occupied by defendant previous to the institution of this suit.
Our conclusions upon the law are, that under the foregoing facts, the judgment rendered for the defendant was a proper one, and such as should have been rendered, and that the same should be affirmed, and it is now so ordered.

216288,Sabine & East Texas Railway Company v. R. W. Ewing,1892-12-08,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
Action to recover damages for personal injuries, brought in the District Court of Jefferson County, October 28, 1890, by the defendant in error against the plaintiff in error, received while in the employment of the defendant as fireman on an engine, and which were alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the plaintiff in error in its failure to keep in repair the attachments and fastenings which held the engine and tender together, by reason whereof, while plaintiff was engaged in the discharge of his duty on said engine and tender, they suddenly became detached from each other, and plaintiff was thrown down between them and seriously injured.
Defendant pleaded general denial, not guilty, and a special plea of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.
Trial was had by jury, November 27, 1890, and verdict and judgment were rendered in favor of the plaintiff for $30,000. The errors assigned relate to the giving and refusing of instructions to the jury, and that the verdict of the jury is unsupported by the evidence and is excessive in amount.
The second and ninth assignments of error are grouped by the plaintiff in error in its brief, and present the second section of the charge of the' court, which is complained of as erroneous and defective, and a special charge requested by the defendant in order to correct the same. This is objected to by the defendant in error as in violation of the rules. We think it a proper practice, in the preparation of briefs, for the appellant or plaintiff, in error to group such assignments, and that it is to be commended rather than objected to, where they present the same question, as in the case of a defective charge with the special instruction requested to correct the same. But the court is not required to select one of the several charges asked as an entirety and give it, when the others are not applicable or called for by the facts of the case, or because the court has already fully instructed the jury on the question. Brownson v. Scanlan, 59 Texas, 222. The special instructions requested by the defendant were several paragraphs, apparently written one after the other, and relating to different phases of the case, without being separated, except that they are numbered; but in view of the disposition we shall make of the case, we deem it proper to notice some of the special instructions requested by the defendant.
The section of the charge complained of is as follows: “ The defendant pleads the general denial, which has the legal effect to throw upon plaintiff the burden of showing by the evidence to your satisfaction, that he has been damaged substantially as alleged, and that such damage was caused, as alleged by liim, by a defect in the appliances used as a coupling, or to which the coupling of the engine was attached, and that such defect was known, or by the exercise of proper care on the part of the defendant or those employes of defendant whose duty it was to inspect and ascertain such defect, might have been known; and the measure or amount of damages that the plaintiff had sustained, if any, so as that you may with reasonable certainty assess the same by your verdict, before the plaintiff would be entitled to recover.”
And the special instruction requested was: “ If you believe from the evidence in this case that plaintiff, Ewing, knew, or by the exercise of ordinary care and prudence might have known, of any old crack, if any, in the casting which coupled the tender, or tank, to the engine, and believe from the evidence that he continued afterward to pursue, and was at the time of such injuries pursuing, his employment in the use of said tender and engine, then, although you may believe such old crack existed therein, and that it was the cause of his injury, he can not in such case recover of defendant; and if you so believe, you will find for defendant.”
There was no error in the charge given, for it correctly stated what the plaintiff was required to show. If, in connection with the evidence as developed on the trial, it should appear that the injuries were received by the fault or negligence of the plaintiff, then he would not be entitled to recover, and this was presented in a subsequent portion of the charge. The requested instruction, while in the abstract correct, would probably have misled the jury as to the care required of the plaintiff, when taken in connection with that required of the defendant to furnish machinery and appliances that were reasonably safe, because the plaintiff would not be charged with the duty of inspecting the coupling for latent defects. Railway v. Crenshaw, 71 Texas, 346.
Without setting out the third paragraph of the charge of the court, which is complained of as erroneous, and the special instructions requested in connection therewith, we are of the opinion that the charge given was perhaps misleading to the jury with respect to the duty of the defendant to furnish reasonably safe machinery and appliances; and that the third special instruction requested by the defendant should have been given, as it very correctly states the duty with which the defendant and plaintiff were respectively charged. Railway v. Crenshaw, 71 Texas, 346.
We do not think that the evidence called for the fourth special instruction, to the effect that if the company was not chargeable with negligence under the evidence, but that the engineer was negligent, and his negligence caused the injury, then the engineer, being the fellow servant of the plaintiff, the jury should find for the defendant; because whatever negligence there may have been shown on the part of the engineer was the failure to inspect the engine and see that the coupling was in a safe condition; and as this was the duty of the defendant, the failure of the engineer to properly inspect would be the negligence of the defendant and not of the engineer, a fellow servant.
The judgment in this case is for the sum of $30,000, and it is complained of as being excessive. Plaintiff’s injuries were shown to have been very severe. Dr. Calhoun, his physician, testified: “ He was pretty badly wounded. He had a wound on the side of his neck, one behind his ear, one on each ear, and another wound on his shoulder, and his jaw was broken. His eyes were crossed pretty badly. His wound on his shoulder is permanent, and the one behind the ear may become permanent; the bone was exposed a good deal. That bone, possibly, in the course of time, may become dead. A portion of the shoulder-blade was exposed, and a portion of that bone is dead. It will finally cause the wound to run. He will never have good use of his arm, and probably he will be troubled a great deal with his shoulder unless he has an operation performed on it. It cari be operated on and probably healed permanently. I think he has lost the use of his arm for life. The bone was injured where the collar bone and shoulder come together, and that weakens the muscles of the arm. His jaw was fractured in the lower part, and two teeth were pressed upwards and one was finally pulled out. By an operation his shoulder may be permanently healed and prevented from running. He can never be given the arm back again. It may be healed up if the bone is not too much diseased. It may be more diseased than I think. He may possibly use it for writing.” Witness testified as to the cost of an operation on the shoulder, that it would perhaps be $200, and stated that he was fully assured that the bone would not heal without an operation.
Plaintiff was 24 years old and stout and healthy at the time he was injured, and a strong man. His wages were from $2.10 to $2.25 a day. With respect to his injuries, he said: “I was knocked insensible and did not know anything for about four and a half days, and when I came .to my right mind I had a hole cut in the side of my neck and back of my shoulders, and the top of my ear was gone, and there was a hole knocked in the side of my head just behind my ear; one jaw was broken. I was knocked cross-eyed and am deaf in one ear. I am now unable to use my right arm. The wound in my shoulder is not well yet; it is still running. The doctor got bones out of me. I had a box full taken out here in Beaumont, and when I went to the hospital they took out a double hand-full. My jaw was broken. My shoulder-blade came through the skin at first.” He was confined to his bed about eight weeks before he could sit up any length of time. His wounds still hurt him, and he suffered considerably in mind and body. It was four months or more before he was able to walk around alone. He was in such condition that he could do no work.
Delivered December 8, 1892.
We are of the opinion that the judgment is excessive in amount. While the injuries were very severe and the damage great, still the amount is very large, and can not be sustained by any rule of computation.
It is not necessary to notice any of the remaining assignments of error. Because the judgment of the court below is excessive, it will be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded."

The record contains neither statement of facts, motion for new trial, nor exceptions to the conclusions of law and findings of fact filed by the judge who tried the cause below. The points raised really relate to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conclusions of law. Inasmuch as the facts found do not affirmatively show that the conclusions of law and judgment were erroneous, we might dispose of the case, in the present state of the record, upon that ground alone. We think, however, the facts stated in the findings sufficiently show liability of appellant as a tenant holding over, for the sum adjudged against him; and also that he was not liable, as claimed by appellee, after notice given of the termination of the relation of landlord and tenant. The court found that Putnam was appellee’s agent, and that appellee received notice through him, and held that the twelve days notice before the time when the next rental year would begin was sufficient time. The record shows nothing to enable us to say this was not correct.

219067,"B. A. Shepard v. The Galveston, Houston & Henderson Railway Company",1893-03-09,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
This action was brought by the appellant on October 28,1882, in the District Court of Galveston County, in trespass to try title to recover of the appellee lots 507 and 508, section 1, on Galveston Island.
Defendant pleaded not guilty; and specially pleaded peaceable, open, adverse, notorious, and uninterrupted use and enjoyment of the easement of the right of way over said lots 100 feet in width for more than four, ten, and twenty years prior to the institution of this suit; also, that Allen, Poole & Co., while owners of the land sued for, and through whom plaintiff acquired title, acquiesced in and recognized the right of defendant to use its right of way across said lots, and encouraged defendant to continue so doing, and gave defendant permission to lay side tracks and switches upon said lots; that the accquiescence, recognition, and permission of said Allen, Poole & Co. gave to defendant the use of the right of way, and that plaintiff was concluded therefore from attempting to deprive the defendant of the same. Further, that the use of said right of way was well known to the plaintiff, and he had full notice thereof, and was thereby estopped.
Plaintiff replied to the answer by exceptions and pleas. The exceptions were overruled by the court.
November 23, 1891, trial was had without a jury, and the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the recovery of the lots sued for, subject, however, to the use, occupation, and enjoyment by defendant of the right of way thereon of one hundred feet in width, which was adjudged to the defendant.
The case coinés up on exceptions to the admission of paroi evidence to establish an easement of a right of way over the land—that is, an estate in the land—by paroi permission, acquiescence, and gift of the then owners of the land; also, that the possession, use, and occupation of said right of way were not hostile or adverse to the right of the owners of the lots, and did not support the pleas of limitation.
1. In 1860 the title to the lot 507 was shown by the deeds introduced in evidence to be in Thomas E. Moore, who conveyed the same, March 15, 1861, to Richard Stoners, who conveyed to V. B. Poole, February 1, 1870. At that time the title to the lot 508 was in James H. Perkins, who, on December 10, 1868, conveyed it to John F. Megale, who, on May 21, 1869, conveyed the same to V. B. Poole, who conveyed to the firm of Allen, Poole & Co., February 17, 1870.
2. On September 10, 1874, the firm of Allen, Poole & Co. made an assignment to certain assignees for the benefit of their creditors. Their assignees conveyed the lots, April 30, 1881, to one W. II. Palmer, who, on October 22, 1881, conveyed the same to the plaintiff. There is no mention in any of these deeds of the use of the lots by the railway company.
3. Defendant’s railway was constructed over the lots in controversy in the fall of the year 1859. The line has not been changed since; and the road has been in operation by the running of trains over it continuously ever since February, 1860. Trains have been run over the road daily except when the bridge was out. It was not shown by what right the railway company entered upon the land.
4. Allen, Poole & Co. went upon the lots about 1868, and found the railway there. They made no objection to the road being there; they acquiesced in it, and verbally promised to give the company the right of way, and begged it to put in side tracks, which the company did. The witness Poole stated also, that his firm gave the company the right of way, and would have given it a formal deed if they had been requested to do so. More than ten years elapsed from said verbal gift of the right of way until the filing of this suit.
1. The use and possession of the lot in controversy by the defendant as a right of way amounts to an easement therein, which is an estate or interest in the land, which could only be created by deed or grant. Rev. Stats., art. 2464; Railway v. Durrett, 57 Texas, 50; Railway v. Donahoo, 59 Texas, 131. Hence the evidence of Poole, tending to show a verbal gift of the right of way to the defendant, would not be admissible for that purpose alone; but it was admissible for the purpose of showing the character of the defendant’s possession, and as coupled with other evidence, to show the acquisition of the right to the easement by limitation or by the laying of side tracks upon the land. The evidence does not show that the defendant entered upon the lots and used the same under a mere paroi license from the owner. The defendant entered upon the lots and constructed its roadbed thereon in the fall of 1859, and occupied a portion thereof with its track continuously after that time. It also ran trains over the road daily from February, 1860, until the time of the trial, with the exception of the time, as stated by the witness Hoxie, when the bridge was out. How long this may have been was not shown; but it was shown that the line of the track remained unchanged during the whole time.
The entry was a trespass, and the use and occupation of the land, from its exclusive nature, was plainly adverse to the owner. Poole’s evidence showed that his firm found the railway upon the land in 1868, and that they made no objection to its occupation and use, but on the contrary acquiesced therein, and verbally gave a promise to give the company the right of way, and would have executed a formal deed thereto if it had been requested. We do not think that the exercise of acts upon the land of another that would amount to an easement if done under authority of a deed or grant, should necessarily be held to be exercised by the mere license of the owner when the authority is conferred only by paroi. Possession and use of land under a paroi sale or gift thereof is adverse to the seller or donor. The evidence in this case precludes the idea that the railway company was occupying the land under a mere paroi license from Allen, Poole & Co.
2. An easement in land may be acquired by prescription which would presume a grant. Tied, on Real Prop., see. 599; Godd. on Law of Ease., 131, et seq. Without regard to the rule, that the prescription in favor of a grant arising from the lapse of time might be rebutted by showing that there was in fact no grant, it seems that the law of limitations would run in this State in support of an easement. In Baker v. Brown, 55 Texas, 381, the court applies the statute of ten years limitation to the right to divert water for irrigation. So in Benavides v. Hunt, 79 Texas, 385, it is held that the ten years statute applies to an action by a lessee of the right to mine. See, also, Railway v. Poindexter, 70 Texas, 98; and Railway v. Wilson, 83 Texas, 153.
Plaintiff’s contention is, that there was not an adverse claim of the right of way by the defendant, nor for such period as would confer title under the statute of ten years limitation, and that whatever may have been the claim of the defendant before Allen, Poole & Co. became the owners of the land, the right of way was used then in recognition of their title and under a paroi license from them. But as we have already said, the facts do not show that the defendant acted under a mere license. The possession and occupation by defendant under the verbal gift of the right of way, as testified to by Poole, was such adverse possession and use thereof as would put in operation the statute of limitations; and it was shown that there was such possession and use for more than ten years prior to the institution of this suit.
3. A paroi gift of land will be sustained when possession has been taken and valuable improvements made on the faith of it. It was shown that Allen, Poole & Co. gave the right of way to the defendant, and that it put in side tracks; and we may easily infer from the evidence that the side tracks were put in for the benefit of Allen, Poole & Co., as well as. of the company. In the case of Railway v. Jarrell, 60 Texas, 267, a verbal agreement to give the right of way to a railway was upheld.
There was no contention in that case that Jarrell was in any way obligated or bound in writing to give the right of way. It was held, that under all the facts disclosed as to the agreement in reference to the right of way, which was verbal, and as to the actual entry under the agreement, and the things transpiring between the parties after the entry, matters had reached a stage at which the agreement or license to enter could not be-entirely repudiated by the appellee and the permission to enter revoked, and that Jarrell could not maintain an action of ejectment.
We are of the opinion that the defendant had acquired the right of way both by limitation and by possession and improvement under the' donation thereof by Allen, Poole & Co.; and that there was therefore no error in the judgment of the court below.
The judgment will be affirmed.

216236,Martin Clothing Company et al. v. W. B. Page et al.,1892-12-08,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
W. B. Page brought suit, in the District Court of Houston County, against N. E. Albright, and caused an attachment to be issued and levied on a certain stock of goods and lands belonging to the defendant. Similar suits were brought by John Albright and others. The goods were sold, as perishable property, by order of the district judge, made in chambers in the suit of W. B. Page, and the proceeds were paid in the registry of the court.
This appeal is from the judgment of the court below sustaining a general demurrer to the petition in intervention of appellants, as junior attaching creditors of said N. E. Albright, to set aside the attachments of Page and others, and establish the prior right of the intervenors to páyment out of said attached property and its proceeds. John Albright and others were made parties to the intervention, and all proper parties were before the court.
The only error assigned is to the action of the court in sustaining the general demurrer to the petition in intervention. Special exceptions were filed, as well as a general demurrer, but in rendering judgment the court ignored the special exceptions and sustained the general demurrer.
Appellants’ petition in intervention substantially set forth, that they were creditors respectively of N. E. Albright, and that they had levied their respective attachments on the stock of goods in question, and had their attachment lien foreclosed and judgment rendered upon their debts, but prior thereto the said W. B. Page and John Albright had attachments levied on the same stock of goods and the goods had been sold, and the money was now in the custody'of the court; and praying that they be paid in preference of the said W. B. Page and John Albright, because, as they alleged, the said W. B. Page and John Albright did collude with, and arrange, agree, and combine with, the defendant N. E. Albright to the effect and with the understanding that the said defendant N. E. Al-bright would consent, and he did consent and agree, that the said W. B. Page and John Albright might levy their said attachments upon his said stock of goods and all other property of his that was subject to execution, with the intent to hinder, delay, and defraud the creditors of N. E. Al-bright, and especially the complainants, who were then, and for some time before had been, bona ñde creditors of the said N. E. Albright. ' It was further shown, that the ground alleged in the suits for attachments by the said W. B. Page and John Albright was that the said N. E. Al-bright “is about to convert a part of his property into money for the purpose of placing it beyond the reach of his creditors,” and complainants averred that the ground so alleged for attachment was not true in fact, and therefore there was no cause for the said attachments by the said W. B. Page and John Albright; and it was further averred, that the said W. B. Page claimed and asserted in his behalf a mortgage from the said N. E. Albright upon land as security for his said debt, in whole or in part, and the said security was sufficient to satisfy his said debt, or a large part thereof, and that the levy of the said attachment by him was in excess of any just demands he had against the said N. E. Albright, and consented to by the said N. E. Albright, as aforesaid, was in law and fact a voluntary disposition of his property in fraud of his other creditors; that at the time of the levy of the said attachments by the said W. B. Page and John Albright, the said N. E. Albright was largely in debt, and by reason of the said attachments and levies all of the defendant’s property was seized and disposed of, so far as same could be reached by execution; and that the said N. E. Albright, about the same time, transferred, assigned, and made over to Earle Adams, of the firm of Adams & Adams, all the notes and accounts belonging to him, and other property, and the said Adams is and was the attorney for the said W. B. Page and said John Albright in their said suits against the said N. E. Albright; and that the said goods sold under the order of this court were bought in by the said Earle Adams, Esq., and his son, Joe Adams, who were associated together in the practice of law as partners, and the goods thereafter returned to the possession of the said N. E. Albright, who is now in possession and full control ""of same, selling, using, and disposing of the same according to his pleasure; all of which, it was alleged, was arranged and contrived as a part of the plan by which the said goods should be placed beyond the reach of creditors of the said N. E. Albright. It was alleged that all of said writs have been levied upon certain lands belonging to the defendant N. E. Albright, and appellants prayed that they be subjected to priority in favor of their writ.
We think that the petition is good on general demurrer. It is alleged that the attachment was the result of a collusive agreement between the plaintiff John Albright and the defendant; and that it was made with the intent to hinder, delay, and defraud the creditors of the defendant, and especially the complainants, who were then, and for some time before had been, bona fide creditors of the said N. E. Albright. Rev. Stats., art. 2465. As stated in Johnson v. Heidenheimer, 65 Texas, 263, “a fraudulent diversion of a debtor’s property may be as effectively, and is as frequently, accomplished by a collusive suit as by a direct transfer,* and both means are denounced by the statute in -the same terms.’ ’ It is true that it is not alleged that the claims of Page and John Albright were fictitious, but the attachments would also be invalid, either because they were suffered or procured to be made for the use and benefit of the defendant, or that they were contrived between the parties with the intent to hinder, defraud, or delay the other creditors of the said N. E. Albright. Claflin v. Sylvester, 12 S. W. Rep., 508. Both of these grounds appear to have been substantially alleged; sufficiently so, at least, to be good on general demurrer.

216213,"Fordyce and Swanson, Receivers Saint Louis, Arkansas Texas Railway Company, v. L. M. Withers",1892-12-08,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
This action was brought against the plaintiffs in error, as receivers of the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company in Texas, to recover damages for personal injuries received by the wife of the defendant in error while a passenger on a train on said railway during the time it was being operated by said receivers.
Plaintiffs in error pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court, that at the time of the accident the railway was being operated by them as receivers, through employes, under appointment and orders of the Circuit Court of the United States in and for the Eastern District of Texas, and that the cause of action they are sued on is not any act or transaction of theirs as receivers, and that the consent of said Circuit Court had not been obtained for the institution of the suit. Since the passage of the act of Congress authorizing suits against a receiver without leave of the court in which the receivership may be pending, it has not been necessary to obtain such leave. The cause of action in this case is an act or transaction of the receivers which comes within the act of Congress. Brown v. Gay, 76 Texas, 444. There is no attempt by the act of Congress to confer jurisdiction upon the courts of any State which they did not have before. By a comity between courts, it is a well settled rule of law that a receiver of property appointed by one court can not be sued in another with respect to that property without the consent of the court appointing him. Such a suit would be in contempt of the court whose officer the receiver was, punishable by that court; and if brought to the attention of the court in which it is instituted by a proper plea, the right to maintain it would be refused. The act of Congress, as well as our State law, authorizing suits against receivers without the consent of the courts by which they were appointed, changes the rule; but both these acts protect the courts having jurisdiction of the original cause in which the receivership is being conducted in the due administration thereof; and the provision of the Federal statute that “ such suit shall be subject to the general equity jurisdiction of the court in which such receiver or manager was appointed, so far as the same shall be necessary to the ends of justice,” is probably no greater reservation of power than courts appointing receivers would have generally, to be exercised by injunction against the parties, not the courts, to prevent interference with or a diversion of the property in the hands of the receiver.
Green Sanders, a witness for the plaintiff, was permitted to testify, over the objection of the defendant, that he"" had visited the scene of the wreck where Mrs. Withers was injured, and saw some old timbers lying around the place of the wreck and some new work done there; that old ties had been taken out and new ones put in, or the ties that were there before had been reset; the work was new or recent at that place, and the ties that were there had no marks on them made by a wheel running off the rail on to the ties. This testimony does not come within the rule as announced in Railway v. Johnston, 78 Texas, 536, and Railway v. McGowan, 73 Texas, 355.
The defendants’ witnesses had -testified to the good condition of the track, and that it was used after the wreck without having been repaired, and the evidence was properly admitted in rebuttal thereof. It was also admissible for the purpose of showing the actual condition of the track, but not for the purpose of showing an admission by the defendants that the track was defective. It was, however, error to permit the witness to testify as to other wrecks. Railway v. Mitchell, 75 Texas, 81.
The eighth, ninth, and tenth assignments of error are to the refusal of the court to give the first, second, and third special instructions requested by the defendants, which are as follows:
“1. If the evidence in this case shows to their (the jury’s) satisfaction that the car upon which Mrs. Withers was a passenger ran off the track and was overturned, and that she was injured, and if the evidence fails to disclose any defect in the machinery connected with the train, or any defect in the road bed, rails, or ties, and fails to show any mismanagement or conduct upon the part of those operating the train, then it would be your duty to return a verdict for defendants.
“2. If the evidence in the case shows that the car upon which Mrs. Withers was a passenger was overturned, and there is no cause or reason shown for the overturning of the car, and if the defendants have shown that the road bed and cars and machinery connected therewith were suitable and in good condition, and that the operatives of the train were in exercise of reasonable care and prudence in the management and running of the train, then the jury would not be authorized to return a verdict for the plaintiff, and you will find for the defendants.
“3. Railway companies in carrying passengers, under the law, do not become insurers of the safety of passengers, and are not liable for injuries which result from an accident produced by any latent defects in machinery or road bed, which could not have been foreseen and provided against by due care in relation to the business of operating such railways; and if you believe from the evidence in this case that the wreck in which Mrs. Withers was injured was accidentally brought about by some unexplained defect, which could not have been seen and provided against by the defendants in this case by the exercise of such prudence and care as reasonably cautious persons would have exercised under the circumstances, then the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, and you should return a verdict for defendants.”
While in this State the happening of an accident to a passenger does not make a prima facie case of negligence, as held in some States (Railway v. Robinson, 73 Texas, 284; Railway v. Burnett, 80 Texas, 538), still the derailment of a passenger car of a railway company is evidence of negligence in the company in the absence of any explanation showing that the accident happened without fault of the railway company. Railway v. Smith, 74 Texas, 276. The first and second instructions as above requested ask for a finding for the defendants on a state of facts which ignores the accident. Such a charge would be upon the weight of evidence. All of the facts should be submitted to the jury, and they should find whether or not there was negligence. The third instruction requested is correct, with a further explanation to the jury as to what prudence and care reasonably cautious persons would have exercised under the circumstances, which, as laid down in Railway v. Halloren, 53 Texas, 53, is, “ that high degree of care and skill which very cautious persons generally, in their line of business, are accustomed to use under similar circumstances, to prevent danger.”
In this connection, the following charge of the court was error: “ The defendants in this cause, as carriers of passengers operating a railway, are held under the law to the greatest possible care and diligence for the safety of the passengers they undertake to transport; they are not insurers of the absolute safety of their passengers, but they are required to provide for their safe conveyance as far as human care and foresight will go. And their duty extends to the providing of good and sufficient material, the employment of skilled engineers, correct methods in the original construction, inspection, and subsequent maintenance in repair of its road, embankments, culverts, road bed, ties, and of the engines and cars which it uses, and the speed of its trains in the transportation of its passengers; and a failure of duty in any of these respects renders the defendants liable.”
Delivered December 8, 1892.
Too great care is imposed upon the defendants as carriers of passengers by this charge. Defendants are not bound to the greatest possible care. Their obligation is very correctly stated in Railway v. Halloren, 53 Texas, 53, and we do not deem it necessary to do more than refer to that case for the guidance of the court in framing the charge on another trial of this case.
There was no error in refusing the eleventh and thirteenth requested instructions. While the defendants’ ties or the unusual speed may not separately have caused the derailment of- the train, yet each may have contributed to it.
A diminished capacity to earn money is a proper element of damage. It is true there was no evidence showing what Mrs. Withers could have earned before the injuries complained of were received, and what she could earn afterward; yet the evidence showed that in the discharge of her duties about the management of the hotel her capacity was diminished; and while it amounts to much the same thing, the charge of the court should have submitted to the jury her diminished capacity to do the work she was accustomed to do about the hotel, rather than a diminished capacity to earn money, as there was no evidence directly as to what that was.
We do not deem it necessary to pass on the sixth assignment of error, relating to the admission of evidence on the part of the plaintiff after the case had been closed, and the refusal to hear evidence of the defendants in rebuttal thereof, as the case must be reversed for errors already pointed out, and the error assigned is not likely to occur on another trial.
It was improper for counsel for plaintiff to state to the jury that he had drawn the petition under facts in cases not so bad as this, and had put the amount claimed as low as he thought he could, and other language to the same effect. He was, in effect, testifying before the jury, and the language called for something more from the court than a mere direction to the jury not to regard it.
The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded."
219251,William Stapleton v. Fannie Wilcox et al.,1893-03-16,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
In 1885 appellees recovered judgment against R. W. Crawford and W. F. Duer, in the District Court of Waller County, from which Crawford and Duer prosecuted an appeal to the Supreme Court, giving a supersedeas appeal bond, to which the name of William Stapleton, the present plaintiff in error, appeared as one of the sureties.
On March 1, 1887, the judgment of the District Court was affirmed, and the amount thereof adjudged against the sureties on the bond. Mandate was sent down to the District Court, and an execution was issued on the 10th day of May, 1887, against all the parties to the appeal bond, including Stapleton. The present suit was then instituted by Stapleton to enjoin the writ, and to set aside the judgment of the Supreme Court, upon the allegation that he had never signed the appeal bond, but that his name appearing thereto had been forged by some one unknown to him. A preliminary injunction was issued restraining the execution. Defendants filed exceptions to the petition, and a motion to dissolve the injunc-tian, on the ground that the District Court had no jurisdiction to grant the relief prayed for, and that if it could be obtained from any court, the Supreme Court was the only tribunal empowered to grant it. These exceptions were sustained, the injunction was dissolved, and the cause dismissed.
The Supreme Court could obtain jurisdiction over the person of the plaintiff in error, as a surety on the appeal bond, by his voluntary act in signing it. If he did not in fact sign it, he never became a party to the proceeding, and no power to render judgment against him was ever obtained by that court.
The reasons upon which are based the decisions which hold that a party to a judgment will not be allowed to attack it collaterally, by evidence aliunde the record that he had never been served with process, have no application here. The court, when its judgment is based upon service of process upon a party to the suit, is bound to inquire into its regularity and sufficiency, and when it has done so and pronounced its judgment, the record is held by our courts to impart absolute verity, and can not, in collateral proceedings, be contradicted by evidence to show that the party was not in fact served.
The Supreme Court in passing on appeal bonds makes no inquiry into the genuineness of the signature to the same, but accepts them as they are found in the record. It does not undertake to ascertain whether the sureties actually executed the instrument, and has no means of doing so, unless issue is made before it. The judgment upon the bond follows as a matter of course upon affirmance of the judgment upon which the appeal is taken. One whose name has been forged to such a bond, without his knowledge, is no party to the appeal, and has no opportunity of being heard before that tribunal prior to the rendition of the judgment. To hold that it is conclusive against him would be a violation of fundamental principles, which bind no persons by judgments except parties and privies, and which entitle every one to a hearing before condemnation.
The judgments of the Supreme Court have no greater efficacy than the final decrees of other courts of competent and general jurisdiction. A judgment pronounced by it without having obtained jurisdiction is as open to attack as that of any other tribunal. Against execution of a void judgment, equity will always, when necessary, afford relief by injunction. Witt v. Kaufman, 25 Texas Supp , 384; Johnston v. Loop, 2 Texas, 330.
The original jurisdiction belonging properly to courts of equity is vested in the District Courts. The Supreme Court possesses no such powers. Its jurisdiction is appellate; and hence it is true that when the aid of equity is sought to afford relief to which a party is entitled against its judgment, the District Court and not the Supreme Court is the proper forum in which to institute the proceedings. It is true the Supreme Court has ample powers to “ ascertain such matters of fact as may be necessary to the proper exercise of its jurisdiction,” but the jurisdiction in aid of the exercise of which such evidence is receivable is its appellate jurisdiction. It doubtless had the power, as an incident to the proper disposition of the appeal in question, had the issue been made, to inquire into the execution of this bond. But the issue was not made by the parties, and plaintiff in error can not be held concluded by a judgment in a cause to which he was in no proper sense a party.
The execution, if the facts alleged by plaintiff are true, conferred upon the sheriff no authority to levy upon plaintiff’s property, and was properly enjoined. The cause should have been heard upon the evidence, and if it was found that plaintiff had not executed the bond, nor authorized its execution, the sheriff and other defendants should have been perpetually enjoined from enforcing the judgment against plaintiff.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered March 16, 1893."
219142,"Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company v. J. B. Borsky",1893-03-16,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
This is an appeal from a judgment rendered by the County Court of Fort Bend County, at the suit of the appellee, against the appellant. The basis of the suit was alleged injury to the growing crop of plaintiff, resulting from the alleged negligence of defendant in the construction of its roadbed lying near to the lands leased and cultivated by appellee. The plaintiff laid his damages in the sum of $840, and obtained judgment for the sum of $560.
The appellant filed general and special demurrers, and pleaded general denial; and specially denied that its roadbed was negligently constructed, and averred that it was constructed with due care and skill; and averred further, that the damage to the crops of plaintiff was the result of plaintiff’s own negligence.
The first assignment of error is, that the court erred in not sustaining defendant’s demurrer to so much of plaintiff’s “ amended petition as set up claim for damages to his crops on the 5th of June, 1890, because such claim was a new cause of action, and one which accrued, if such existed, long after the institution of plaintiff’s suit.” We think there was no error committed by the court in overruling this demurrer.
Upon the trial there was evidence tending to show, that plaintiff’s crops could have been protected from overflow by a ditch, and that such ditch might have been opened at a cost of $300; and it is insisted by appellant, under his sixth assignment of error, that the evidence showed such contributory negligence on the part of appellee as should defeat his right to recover for an injury against which he might have protected himself.
The law on this subject is thus stated by Mr. Field in his work on Damages (section 21): “It is the duty of a party to protect himself from the injurious consequences of the wrongful act of another, if he can do so by ordinary effort and care or at a moderate expense, for which effort and expense he may charge the wrongdoer. And where by use of such means he may prevent loss, he can only recover for such loss as could not thus be prevented.”
We do not think it can be said in reference to this case, that the cutting of a ditch at a cost of $300 would have been but “ ordinary care and effort” on the part of appellee, nor that the outlay of $300 could be termed “a moderate expense.” The appellee was not required to make such an expenditure to protect his property from injury resulting from the alleged negligence of appellant. Besides, the evidence discloses that the appellee is not the owner, but the lessee, of the land upon which he was farming, and it is doubtful whether under any circumstances a lessee would be required to cut a ditch, such as the one proposed, for his protection against the wrongful act of another. A tenant under an ordinary lease would have no authority to make such change or alteration in the property of his landlord.
The appellant’s objections to the evidence offered and admitted by the court to ascertain the value of the crops alleged to have been destroyed, we think are well taken; and for the error of the court in permitting witnesses for the plaintiff to testify as to the cost of planting and cultivating the crops up to the time of their alleged destruction, without further evidence, the cause must be reversed. Railway v. McGowan, 73 Texas, 355; Railway v. Pape, 73 Texas, 502. In these cases it is held, that the most satisfactory means of determining the value of a growing crop at any stage of its existence, is to prove its probable yield under proper cultivation, the value of such, a yield when matured and ready for sale, and also the expense of producing the crop, harvesting it, and preparing it for and transporting it to market. When a witness, whose opinion is admissible as evidence, shows by his testimony that his opinion is formed from insufficient data, the evidence should be rejected. Had the opinions of the witnesses whose testimony was objected to by appellant been given without showing upon what their opinions were formed, the witnesses having qualified themselves as experts, their opinions would have been- admissible in evidence.
For the error of the court in admitting the testimony, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for another trial.
Reversed and remanded.

216179,"Charles Dillingham, Receiver of Houston & Texas Central Railway Company, v. Joseph Fischl",1892-12-15,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
This is an action in which the appellee, Joseph Fischl, who was the plaintiff in the court below, sued the appellant, Charles Dillingham, as receiver of the Houston & Texas Central Railway Company, who was defendant in the court below, in the District Court of Washington County, on the 22nd day of February, 1890, to recover the statutory penalty for refusing to deliver a car of flour shipped from St. Louis, Missouri, to Brenham, Texas, directed to appellee by the terms of the bill of lading. The penalty sued for was the sum of $94.88, the amount specified in the bill of lading, for each day the flour was detained.
The appellee was a merchant doing business in Brenham, Texas, and on or about the 16th day of December, 1889, appellee purchased a car of flour, weighing 23,720 pounds, from the Kaufman Milling Company, in St. Louis, Missouri. The contract of purchase was made through one Slater, who was the agent of the Kaufman Milling Company at Brenham, Texas; and on or about the said 16th day of December, 1889, the Kaufman Milling Company, acting for and on behalf of the appellee, Joseph Fischl, delivered said car of flour to the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway, which was then and there a common carrier from the city of St. Louis, Missouri, into the State of Texas, making connection with the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway and the Houston & Texas Central Railway, leading to the city of Brenham, in the State of Texas.
The said St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company issued, executed, and delivered to appellee’s agent, the Kaufman Milling Company, in the city of St. Louis, Missouri, a bill of lading, whereby it acknowledged it had received said car of flour for shipment from St. Louis, Missouri, to Brenham, Texas, and it appeared from said bill of lading that the rate of freight on said flour was 40 cents per 100 pounds, via the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway, from St. Louis to Brenham, Texas, and that said freight was to be carried via said railway (the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe); and when said car of flour arrived at its destination, Brenham, Texas, the appellee tendered the appellant the sum of $94.88, which was the amount specified in the bill of lading, which amount was declined, and 53 cents per 100, the established rate, demanded, which was refused by appellee.
The defendant answered by a general and special demurrer and general and special answer. The special demurrer was sustained. The special answer alleged, that said car of flour was shipped from St. Louis, Missouri, to Brenham, Texas; that when said car of flour reached and arrived at Corsicana, it was, in the due course of business, turned over to defendant for transportation to Brenham, and that said flour was carried to Brenham within a reasonable time and in good order and condition; that after said car of flour arrived at Brenham, its destination, the same was tendered to appellee, demanding of him the regular schedule rate, which he refused to pay, and left said flour in the possession of appellant.
That appellant, before and at the time of the shipment of said flour, had established schedule rates of freight, as required by the act of Congress, and that the schedule rate on flour from St. Louis, Missouri, to Brenham, Texas, was 53 cents per 100 pounds'via the Houston & Texas Central Railway.
That the said St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway did not run into the city of Brenham, and all goods and merchandise from Brenham via the Houston & Texas Central Railway was delivered to appellant at Corsicana, a station on the line of its road.
And the appellant further alleged and charged, that after said flour arrived in the city of Brenham, its destination, and after appellee refused to pay the schedule charges due thereon, that his (appellee’s) agent, or some person for him in St. Louis, Missouri, the Kaufman Milling Company, telegraphed said appellee, Joseph Fischl, to pay schedule charges demanded of him by appellant, and that they would protect and hold appellee harmless, all of which appellee refused to do, but said flour remained in the possession of appellant for more than a month, when the appellee paid the schedule charges and took said flour.
The appellee demanded a jury, and said cause was tried and resulted in a verdict and judgment for appellee for $4079.84. A motion for a new trial was made and overruled, and notice of appeal given.
Appellant’s first assignment of error is as follows: 11 The court erred in not permitting the defendant, Dillingham, to establish and prove the fact by the plaintiff and other competent testimony that the said Kaufman Milling Company proposed and would have held the plaintiff, Fischl, harmless, and offered to pay the difference between 40 and 53 cents per 100 pounds on the car of flour.”
We are of the opinion that this assignment presents a proposition which can not be sustained, and that the court did not err in excluding the evidence offered by appellant to show that the appellee would not consent that the difference between rate of freight specified in the bill of lading and that demanded by appellant might be paid by the Kaufman Milling Company. If the appellant be liable for the penalty imposed by the statute for demanding more freight than that named in, the bill of lading, and refusing to deliver the freight to the consignee until the freight demanded was paid by the consignee, the latter could not be deprived of the right to recover the penalty by the willingness of a third party to pay the difference in the freights. Had this difference been paid by the shipper to the appellant, and appellant had then made a tender to appellee of the goods, upon payment by the latter of the freight charges named in the bill of lading, it may be that from such tender by appellant he would have been relieved from any further liability under the statute. But it certainly was not incumbent upon appellee to aid and assist the appellant in relieving himself from any liability he had incurred to appellee, or would incur, by continuing to hold the goods after their delivery had been demanded.
The appellant’s eleventh assignment is as follows: “The court erred in following the State statute when it conflicted with the act of Congress, and instructed the jury under the terms of the State statute to find for the plaintiff.” This assignment presents the controlling question of the case, and upon its solution depends the affirmance or reversal of the judgment of the lower court. The evidence shows, we think, beyond cavil, that the carload of flour, the alleged illegal detention of which by appellant is the basis of appellee’s suit, was purchased by appellee’s agent in St. Louis, Missouri, and by him delivered to the agent of the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway, a common carrier from the State of Missouri into the State of Texas, and that said railway had connection with two railways in the State of Texas, to-wit, the defendant railway and the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway, and that with each of the said railways the said St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway had, at and previous to the delivery of said flour, an agreed and established rate of freight between the city of St. Louis, in Missouri, and the city of Brenham, in the State of Texas; that the rate of freight upon flour via the defendant railway was 53 cents per 100 pounds from St. Louis to Brenham, and that the rate via the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway was 40 cents per 100 pounds, and that the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway, upon the receipt of the flour from the appellee’s agent, promised and contracted, as evidenced by the bill of lading delivered to said agent, to carry said flour to Brenham, Texas, via the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe road, and to charge therefor 40 cents per 100 pounds, and that said flour was in fact carried by said St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway to Corsicana, Texas, and there delivered to its other connecting line in the State of Texas, the defendant-company; and that defendant did carry said flour, within a reasonable time and in good order and condition, to the city of Brenham, and duly notified the consignee, the appellee, that the flour had reached its destination, and tendered same to appellee upon payment by him of the freight charges at the rate of 53 cents-per 100 pounds, which payment appellee declined to make, and tendered to defendant’s agent at Brenham the amount of the freight money agreed upon by his agent with the said St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway, to-wit, the sum of $94.88, that being the amount of freight due, calculated at the rate of 40 cents per 100 pounds; and with said tender appellee exhibited his bill of lading and demanded the delivery to him of his goods, which demand was by the defendant company’s agent refused, and the said goods were held by defendant until the 8th day of February, 1890, when appellee paid the sum of money demanded by defendant, to-wit, the sum of $1-25.72, and received said flour from defendant. And the evidence further shows, that the said cargo of flour was, when received by defendant at Corsicana, marked and way-billed for Brenham via defendant’s railway, and not marked and way-billed via the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway; and there is no evidence ■ that defendant knew of the contract for shipment via the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway. These facts show that the flour was interstate commerce, and that the defendant company and its connecting line, the said St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company, were common carriers engaged in carrying interstate freight, and were answerable to the laws of Congress regulating interstate traffic. Norfolk v. Railway, 136 U. S., 114, and act of Congress entitled “An act to regulate commerce,” approved in 1887, and its amendments.
By the act of Congress above recited, such carriers who agree upon rates of freight over their lines are required to publish the rates, and to deliver copies of same to the Interstate Railway Commission; and after said rates are so established and continuing in force, any such carrier, or the agent or servant of such carrier, who receives or demands either less or more freight than that previously agreed, on and established, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction is subject to fine and imprisonment.
By the statute of Texas (Act of May 6, 1882), any railroad company, its officers, agents, or employes, that shall refuse to deliver to the owner, agent, or consignee any freight, goods, wares, and merchandise, upon the payment or tender of payment of the freight charges shown by the bill of lading, shall be liable in damages to the owner of said freight, goods, and merchandise to an amount equal to the amount of the freight charges for every day said goods, wares, and merchandise may be held after payment or tender of payment of the charges due, as shown by the bill of lading. This act has been declared by our Supreme Court to be an exercise of the police power of the State, and that it is not in conflict with the Federal Constitution. Railway v. Dwyer, 75 Texas, 578-583.
' Such being the law, the penalty imposed by the statute might be recovered from a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce. Had the goods of appellee been shipped by the contracting railway company, as it promised and agreed to do, via the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway, at the rate of 40 cents per 100 pounds, said rate having been previously agreed upon and established by said companies, and the said Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Company had refused to deliver his goods to appellee upon payment or tender of payment by him to said company of the freight charges as specified in the bill of lading, we have no doubt the appellee might recover the penalty imposed by the statute from said last named company.
But the question for our decision is not whether the law be in conflict with the Federal Constitution, and therefore void, but the question is, can the law be enforced when it demands of a common carrier employed in transporting interstate commerce the doing of that which he is forbidden to do by the laws of Congress, under the penalty of fine and imprisonment? To state this question, it seems to us, is to answer in the negative. A law of Congress, itself constitutional, is paramount to any State law, when the provisions of the latter are antagonistic to those of the former. We therefore conclude that it is immaterial whether the defendant company knew or did not know at the time it received the flour consigned to appellee that the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway had contracted with appellee to transport his merchandise at the rate of 40 cents per 100 pounds. The defendant was required by the statute of this State to receive the cars of roads connecting with it, and under its contract with said connecting railway the defendant was under obligation to carry freight tendered by said line at an agreed rate, and that rate neither the defendant nor the company delivering the goods to defendant could change except by violating the Federal statute. Under such circumstances, we do not think the defendant company could be said to adopt and ratify the bill of lading, if it received the goods with knowledge that the railway company tendering them had contracted with appellee to transport said goods at 40 cents per 100 pounds. And unless the evidence shows that the carrier refusing to deliver goods to the consignee upon payment or tender of payment of the freight specified in the bill of lading, either executed the bill of lading or ratified it, no recovery can be had under the statute. Dwyer v. Railway, 75 Texas, 572. We think the trial court erred in the application of the law to the facts of the case, and that the law was substantially presented in instructions one and two requested by appellant’s counsel.
In answer to the contention of appellee, that the defendant should not be permitted to challenge the binding force upon defendant of the bill of • lading, except under a plea of non est factum, it is sufficient to say that ■ plaintiff’s petition does not charge that the defendant executed the bill"" of lading, or that defendant authorized any one to execute same for defendant, nor does it charge that there was a partnership between defendant and the railway company which executed the bill of lading. In the case cited by appellee’s counsel (Railway v. Tisdale, 74 Texas, 8) the petition charged the existence of a partnership between the defendant company and the connecting railway companies.
Delivered December 15, 1892.
For the error above indicated, our judgment is that the judgment of the lower court be reversed and that the cause be remanded for another trial in accordance with the law as enunciated in this opinion.

219041,"The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. J. M. Coleman et al.",1893-03-16,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
This case originated in the court of a justice of the peace, where judgment was rendered for appellee Coleman, against appellant, upon the following account:
The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company and the Receivers of the International & Great Northern Railroad Company, T. R. Bonner and T. M. Campbell,
To J. M. Coleman, Dr.
To damages for failure to transport said J. M. Coleman from San Antonio to Paris, Texas, as per agreement, on purchase of ticket by said Coleman on May 16, 1891, and failure to furnish said Coleman with sleeping apartments as per agreement, to-wit:
Exposure to rain and mud, loss of sleep, mental and physical suf-
fering, and exposure.................................... §60 00
Bus fare, Temple ........................................ 50
Hotel fare, Temple....................................... 1 50
Value of one day’s time lost............................... 25 00
Telegrams.............................................. 85
Railroad fare from Temple to Paris......................... 6 95
Extra expenses for one day................................ 2 50
§97 30
The judgment was for the amount sued for, and an appeal was taken to the County Court, and was dismissed in the latter court upon motion of appellee; and a writ of certiorari was then sued out by appellant, and the case taken to the County Court, and it was again dismissed from that court, and an appeal was prosecuted to the Court of Appeals, and by that court transferred to this.
While pending in the Court of Appeals, the appellee moved to dismiss the appeal, on the ground that no appeal was allowed from the County Court from a judgment rendered in a case originating in a Justice Court wherein the amount involved was less than §100. This motion was overruled, the Court of Appeals holding that it had jurisdiction to determine whether the County Court committed error or not in dismissing the case. Without committing this court to the ruling of the Court of Appeals in its construction of the law governing and regulating appeals in such cases, we adopt that construction in considering this appeal, and hold that there is no question of jurisdiction presented for our determination.
The sole question for our decision is, did the County Court err in quashing the certiorari and dismissing the appellant’s case, and refusing it a trial de nova ?
It has long been the settled law of this State, that the writ of certiorari will only be granted when the petition shows that the complainant has a meritorious cause of action or defense, and that injustice has been done him, and that such injustice is not due to the complainant’s inexcusable neglect. The record discloses that appellant appeared in the Justice Court, and was present by counsel at the trial. It offered no evidence in bar of the plaintiff’s suit, but asked, in case judgment be rendered for plaintiff against appellant, that it might have judgment over against the appellee the International & Great Northern Railway Company.
The petition for the writ of certiorari upon its face presents a meritorious defense to the appellee’s suit, and the excuse for not making this defense upon the trial before the justice of the peace is, that prior to the trial in the Justice Court, appellant had no information of the nature and character of the plaintiff’s claim, save such as could be obtained from an inspection of plaintiff’s account filed in the Justice Court, and from that account appellant was justified in believing that the claim was based upon the refusal of its servants to permit the appellee to ride upon its road by virtue of the ticket purchased by him in San Antonio from the International & Great Northern Railway Company; and knowing that it had no agent in San Antonio for the sale of tickets, appellant had no reason to suspect, nor did it suspect, that appellee Coleman would upon the trial swear, as he did, that he purchased the ticket described in his account from an agent of appellant, and that said appellant was surprised at this testimony.
This is substantially the excuse offered by appellant for not making the defense presented in its petition before the justice of the peace, and the majority of this court are of opinion that such statement does not render it excusable for failing to make defense to plaintiff’s suit before the justice of the peace, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the County Court, dismissing its suit and refusing it a trial de nova.

219239,Wharton Branch v. C. Anson Jones et al.,1893-03-23,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
In 1884 John Durst instituted suit against John A. Chrystie, C. Anson Jones, Jacob Scherer, and W. W. Manning for the recovery of certain lands claimed by him under a grant alleged to have been made in 1810 by the Spanish Government.
The defendant Manning made no appearance in the suit. The defendants Jones and Scherer, on the 13th of January, 1885, answered jointly, and filed a general demurrer and general denial; and answering further, they claimed to be the owners in fee of an undivided two-thirds of the lands sued for; and averred that plaintiff’s alleged grant was void and was a cloud upon their title, and prayed that said pretended grant be cancelled and held for naught, and that they be quieted in their title and possession, and for costs of suit and for general relief.
On the 18th of July, 1885, defendant Chrystie answered by general demurrer and general denial.
On December 29, 1835, appellant filed petition of intervention, asserting title to an undivided one-third of the lands in controversy; and answering plaintiff’s petition, demurred generally and specially thereto, and asserted a claim to one-third of the land by virtue of an alleged contract with defendant Chrystie for the location of certain certificates upon the public domain of the State of Texas, which locations were upon a portion of the lands claimed by plaintiff under his alleged grant. He denied that he had knowledge at the time of his location of plaintiff’s claim of title, and charged that the alleged grant did not cover all of the lands to which plaintiff was asserting title; and that his claim was greatly in excess of the grant; and he prayed for an order of survey, that the exact quantity of land included within the boundaries of the grant might be -determined.
In the eighth paragraph of intervenor’s answer he sets out his claim of title and prays for relief, which paragraph is in these words:
“ Defendant further denying that his codefendants own all of the lands> in question, respectfully represents, that he made the original location of said lands; that he is an attorney at law, and examined into the said pretended grant to Pedro Lara Posas and to Vincente Michelli, and that through his opinion and advice, and through the further fact of defendant having caused said supposed grant to be translated into English out of the Spanish language, which this defendant did and caused to be done shortly before the files were made on said lands, that it became known and understood by his codefendants that said lands were liable to location; and that at and before the making of such location this defendant had a contract with said John A. Chrystie, and those for whom and with whom he was acting; and that by reason thereof this defendant is entitled to be paid the reasonable value of his services in the premises, and that his co-defendants are liable and bound to pay the same; and that this defendant has never been paid anything whatever, and that his said services are reasonably and justly worth $10,000, or one undivided one-third of the land in controversy in case this defendant be paid in land; and that although the facts of the locating said lands were also well known to the other codefendants, they have never objected thereto, but have insisted thereon, and still claim two-thirds' of the lands aforesaid, and have so waived all matters of controversy, as defendant is informed and believes, between them and said Chrystie and those for whom and with whom said Chrystie is acting, and have accepted such location and adopted the files as made by this defendant; and that such location is a valuable one, and has been ratified by and accepted by all of his codefendants, together with the benefits arising therefrom; but that said codefendants have never set apart any share of said lands so located by this defendant to him as his part thereof, nor otherwise paid him for his services in the premises, and he here now prays that one-third thereof be set apart to him as the reasonable share of and interest in said lands to which he is justly entitled, or that he have judgment in money for the reasonable value of his said services, to-wit, the sum of $10,000. 1-Ie prays also for costs and full and general relief.”
To this plea of intervention the defendants Jones & Scherer and Chrystie answered by general demurrer and general denial; and defendant Chrystie, answering specially, denied that he had ever made a contract with the intervenor by which he agreed to convey him any portion of the said lands or to pay him any sum of money as compensation for his services; and averred, that when said lands were located the said Branch was in defendant’s employment at a salary of $100 per month, with his expenses paid by defendant, and that said Branch was to receive no other compensation for his services, and that his salary and expenses have been fully paid. And the plaintiff likewise answered the intervenor’s petition by general demurrer and general denial.
Upon this state of the pleadings all parties announced ready for trial on the 15th of July, 1891; and thereupon the defendants withdrew their answers, and the plaintiff took a nonsuit; and on ins motion, over the objection of the intervenor, the suit was dismissed, both as to the plaintiff and defendants and the intervenor. To this judgment the intervenor excepted and gave notice of appeal.
It is a well settled rule of practice in this State, that one having an interest in the subject matter of litigation between other parties may intervene in such suit for the purpose of asserting and protecting his interest. Eccles v. Hill, 13 Texas, 65, and Graves v. Hall, 27 Texas, 149. If the appellant’s petition showed by its averments that he had an interest in the subject matter of litigation, and a cause of action against either the plaintiff or defendants, it was his privilege to prosecute his suit to final judgment, and it was error in the court to dismiss his suit. The State v. Loan and Trust Company, 81 Texas, 530. The question therefore presented for our decision is, Does the petition of intervention show that intervenor has an interest in the subject matter of litigation ?
The law gives the surveyor who locates certificates for another no interest in the land located upon; and unless the petition shows a contract between the intervenor and the defendant Chrystie, by which the former was to have a portion of the land for his services, the intervenor has no interest in the subject matter of litigation. The petition discloses no such a contract. The petition in intervention was, in our judgment, bad on general demurrer; and our conclusion is, that there was no error in the judgment of the court in dismissing the intervenor’s suit and giving judgment against him for costs.
The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.

Delivered March 23, 1893."
216186,"Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company v. Trinity County Lumber Company",1892-12-15,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
This suit was brought by appellant against appellee, to recover an amount alleged to be due as freight upon certain narrow guage cars transported over appellant’s road for appellee, and alleged to have been taken by appellee from appellant’s possession by force, without paying the charges for such transportation.
The machinery was shipped by the Lima Machine Works, of Lima, Ohio, consigned to appellant at Groveton, Texas, under a bill of lading issued by the Lake Erie & Western Railway Company, at the former place, in which the cars were described as “ narrow guage cars for use on steam railroad,” and the charge for carriage was stipulated at 53 cents per 100 pounds.
There were joint tariff rates fixed between the Lake Erie & Western Railroad and appellant and connecting lines, regularly scheduled, posted, and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, in accordance with the act of Congress known as “ The Interstate Commerce Law,” in which such freight was divided into two classes, one including “ narrow, guage cars for use upon steam railroads,” upon which the charge for carriage was fixed at 53 cents per 100 pounds, and the other including k k cars, logging, narrow guage,” on which the charge was 84 cents per 100 pounds.
The first class was intended to embrace such cars as were carried for steam railroads engaged in the carrying business, and the other was intended to describe the same kind of cars when they were to be used on tram roads operated in connection with saw mills. Appellee was not engaged in the carrying business, and was not operating a steam railroad further than that its cars were hauled over a tram, used in connection with its saw mill, by steam engines; and for this use the cars were intended. The. freight in this case, therefore, actually belonged to the last named class, while it was described in the bill of lading as belonging to the first. This came about through the action of the machine works from which appellee purchased, whose clerk had the property loaded upon a car of the receiving railroad at Lima, and presented to its agent a shipping order and a bill of lading for signature, with the property thus designated in both. The carrier’s agent signed the bill of lading without seeing the property and supposing it to be correctly classed.
The machine company’s agent knew of the different rates arising from the classification above stated, and represented to the carrying agent that the cars were for use on a narrow guage steam railway. The error was discovered while the car was in transit, by the authorities of an intermediate line, and a corrected way bill was issued to accompany it, stating the freight charges at 84 cents per 100 pounds; and the car, accompanied by this bill, reached appellant’s line at Trinity, and its agent there paid the portion of the freight due the connecting lines according to the 84 cents rate, and forwarded the car to appellee at Groveton. Appellee then tendered to appellant the charges due, according to the bill of lading, and, upon its refusal to accept same, took the property from its possession without its consent. It cost as much to transport such cars for use upon railways as for use in connection with saw mills, and the difference in favor of the former was made because they were public carriers, created business and an interchange of traffic, only compensatory and not remunerative rates being fixed for them. There was no evidence that the higher rate was unreasonable, unless it consists in the difference between the two rates.
The finding of the court below, that appellant was restricted in its recovery to the amount stated in the bill of lading, under the facts of this case, was error. Such instruments, it is true, in general are contracts binding on the carrier, and fixing the remuneration which it is entitled to recover for its service. But here the rate was obtained by a misrepresentation of appellee’s agent as to the class to which the freight belonged. There is no conflict of evidence on this point; and whether this was done innocently or not, on the part of the clerk of the machine works, the result is the same. It constitutes in law a fraud, of which appellee can not reap the benefit. There is no doubt, however, that the correspondence between appellee and the machine works discloses the use for which the former ordered the cars, and that the latter knew of the difference between the rates fixed for the two classes of matter, and designated the cars in the bill of lading so as to secure the lowest rate. The testimony of the clerk who made the shipment discloses these facts.
The act of Congress regulating commerce between the States requires carriers engaged in such traffic to establish and publish schedules of rates,fares, and charges; and makes it unlawful for any such carrier to charge, demand, collect, or receive any greater or less compensation for transportation than is specified in such schedules. Act 1887, sec. 6; amended Act 1889, sec. 6. Appellant and its connecting lines over which the property in question passed had complied with this law, and the classification and charges, about which this controversy arose, were contained in the joint tariff published by them and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. Had they, therefore, knowingly entered into the contract in question, whereby less compensation was charged than was specified in their schedules, they would have been guilty of a violation of that law, and would have incurred severe penalties. Id., sec. 10. And appellant, if it had knowingly collected different rates from those fixed in the schedule, would have been equally guilty as if it had originally made the contract. The same law also prohibits unjust discriminations and the making of unreasonable charges, and appellee contends that the difference between rates allowed carriers and those charged against other shippers constituted an unjust discrimination which would preclude the recovery of the higher rate. But the law does not provide that an unjust discrimination shall have the effect of limiting the carrier to the lowest rate charged. The effect of the different requirements seems to be, that the carrier is bound to schedule its rates, and to fix them at reasonable figures, without unjust discriminations. It is held to the rates established, and can discriminate or charge unreasonable compensation only at the peril of criminal prosecution. If it discriminates unjustly, or charges unreasonable rates, it can be punished by criminal proceedings, and the party injured has his remedy in the courts, by which the carrier can be restricted to such remuneration as is just, and can be held responsible for such damages as its wrongful conduct has occasioned. But the carrier, in dealing with shippers, is required to conform its charges against them to the rates fixed in the published tariff, and can not lawfully depart therefrom. If such charges are unreasonable, the shipper has his remedy. But the mere fact that a less rate is allowed to one class of shippers, for special reasons applicable only to them, than is applied to all others, is not made proof that the rate charged generally is unreasonable.
Delivered December 15, 1892.
The only evidence in the case on the subject is furnished by appellants, and tends to show that the rate charged railways is less than should be charged shippers generally, and that the higher rate is reasonable. Whether or not it is lawful for carriers to make this difference we do not find it necessary to decide. For if it be unlawful, appellant would still be entitled to reasonable remuneration, and this, we have seen, according to the only evidence, is the higher rate. If there was unjust discrimination, and the contract with appellee was therefore unlawful, it is not seen how that can aid it. It claims under the contract, indeed procured it through misrepresentation made to the railway company, by those whose acts must be charged to it, and to permit it to establish the illegality of the contract, and at the same time receive the benefit of it, would be absurd.
The judgment of the court below will be reversed and judgment rendered in this court for appellant for the sum of 8282.65, with interest from July 1, 1889, the date when the goods were tendered to appellee at Groveton, and all costs of suit.
Reversed and rendered."
216225,Western Union Telegraph Company v. John G. Bennett,1892-12-15,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellee resided at Navasota,Grimes County, and his brother Henry resided at Allen, in Collin County. On the 24th day of March, 1890, the wife of Henry Bennett delivered to appellant, at Allen, the following message, addressed to appellee at Navasota, “ Come at once; Henry is dying.” The message was transmitted at once to Navasota and was received there at 8:50 o’clock a. m. of the same day. It was not delivered to appellee until the afternoon of March 26. On that day, before its delivery, appellee had learned from other sources of the dangerous illness of his brother, and went to appellant’s office in Navasota for the purpose of ascertaining, by wire, his condition, and the message was then delivered to him. Thereupon he sent over appellant’s line a dispatch to his brother’s wife, asking information as to her husband’s condition. This message was not delivered to Mrs. Bennett until next day. Appellant, failing to receive an answer, took the train at Navasota the night of the 26th and went to Allen, when he learned that his brother had died on the 25tli and was buried on the 26th.
He brought this suit to recover damages for the failure to deliver both messages. At the trial he was permitted to introduce, over appellant’s objections, the copies of the messages delivered to him and to his sister-in-law-, respectively. The objection was that the original messages delivered to appellant were the primary evidence.
Appellee also introduced evidence of the sending of the message from himself to Mrs. Bennett, and the date of the delivery of the same, and of the fact that no answer was received, which was objected to by appellant, on the ground that it was irrelevant and calculated to mislead the jury.
The court charged the jury, that they would not consider the evidence as to the last message, and that appellee could not recover damages growing out of it. Appellant sought to excuse its failure to deliver the message to appellee by showing that he was unknown to its agents, and that they used due diligence to find him in Navasota, and failed to do so. The evidence upon this point was conflicting. There was positive testimony in behalf of appellee that he had resided in Navasota for three months, was well known there, and was at home in town, and could easily have been found during the whole of the 24th, 25th, and 26th of March; and that his residence was in fact pointed out to appellant’s messenger while the latter was searching for him. This last fact was denied by appellant’s witness, and there was testimony strongly tending to show that appellee left Navasota on the 23d and went to a neighborhood about twenty-five miles away, and did not return until the evening of the 25th. It is not controverted that appellee’s wife was at home during this time. Appellant, however, claims that its agents could not learn anything of such persons in Navasota. It was shown that about noon of the 24th appellant’s messenger reported to its operator at Navasota that appellee could not be found, and that the operator notified appellant’s agent at Allen. The latter informed Mrs. Bennett, and she then informed the operator at Allen, that appellee was not in Navasota, but was near Bryan, and sent him a message, over appellant’s line, to that place.
The admission of the copies of the telegrams delivered by appellant’s agents, on which the suit is founded, was not error. Lumber Co. v. Tel. Co., 58 Texas, 394.
Nor was there error in the admission of evidence as to the sending and delay in delivering the telegram from appellee to Mrs. Bennett, and the failure of appellee to get a reply. The suit was based in part on those facts, and evidence of them was proper. While appellee failed, in the opinion of the court below, to show a right to recover growing out of that transaction, this could not render erroneous the ruling admitting the evidence.
The alleged declaration of the messenger boy, whether admissible as original evidence or not, was competent to contradict him, and affect his credibility before the jury. But we are of opinion it was admissible as affirmative evidence in appellee’s behalf. The messenger was the agent upon whose acts and investigations the appellant largely relied to show a discharge of its duty to appellee. What he said, while engaged in the search, which might in any degree illustrate the degree of his diligence and the good faith of his efforts, was directly pertinent to the issue.
The court charged the jury as follows: “The fact that the message was promptly received at Navasota, and that Bennett lived there, being shown, the burden of proof to show that the message was not delivered to Bennett promptly resulted from some excusable cause, is on the defendant, and it must establish such excusable cause by a preponderance of the evidence, by which is meant the greater weight and degree of credible evidence. ’ ’
Appellant contends that the court erred in charging upon the burden of proof at all, and that the rule given was in itself incorrect. We need not consider what facts would ordinarily make out a prima facie case against a telegraph company for damages for delay in delivering a message. If the purpose of the suit was to recover general damages only, and the burden consequently was on plaintiff to show only a breach of contract, the rule laid down in this instruction might be correct. But when the main recovery sought is special damages, such as are here claimed, certainly the burden ought to be on plaintiff to show such a breach of contract; in other words, such negligence in the delivery of the dispatch as caused such damage.
Delivered December 15, 1892.
The charge of the court nowhere told the jury that the onus in this particular was on plaintiff, and the court refused a special instruction asked by appellant announcing such rule as the law of the case.
Again: Whether the burden was on defendant or not, to show the exercise of proper diligence to deliver the message, the real controversy under the evidence was upon the question of fact, whether or not appellee was in Navasota on the 24th and 25th, and the practical effect of the charge given, probably, was to lead the jury to believe that it was incumbent on appellant to show that appellee was elsewhere. We can not assent to this as the law of the case. Appellee’s whereabouts was peculiarly known to himself, and it would be unjust to require appellant to show it. It was required, rather, to explain its own conduct and show proper efforts to deliver the telegram. We do not suppose that the district judge intended to impose the burden on the defendant to show plaintiff’s absence from town, but such was the state of the evidence that this was the application a jury would probably make of the instruction.
And this illustrates what seems to us the impropriety of giving such charges upon the burden of proof in cases where the evidence stands as it did here. We think there can be no doubt that both parties introduced evidence sufficient, if true, to discharge any burden cast upon them by the law. The issues, therefore, resolved themselves wholly into questions as to the weight of evidence and credibility of witnesses. Knowledge of the rules regulating the burden of proof at the opening of the trial, or at particular stages of the evidence, could not afford any light to guide the jury in determining what witness was most credible or what fact the most weighty. A case standing thus upon the evidence should be considered as a whole, and not by piecemeal. Railway v. Geiger, 79 Texas, 13.
We think the part of the charge which we have quoted was erroneous. Omitting from the charge those parts relating to the burden of proof, it is a very fair and clear submission of the case to the jury.
This disposes of all the assignments of error except the sixth and seventh, which are too indefinite to be considered.
The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded."
216262,W. A. Berry et al. v. E. M. House et al.,1892-12-15,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
In the trial below of this case, which is an action of trespass to try title by appellees, to recover of appellants the east half of the Fred Schrack one-third of a league of land in Madison County, both parties claimed under S. R. Walker, and appellees relied on the following evidences of title:
Deed from S. R. Walker to J. L. Garwood, August 2, 1870, first recorded September 27, 1870, and recorded a second time February 24, 1890, the first record having been burned in 1873.
Deed from Garwood to T. W. House, July 10, 1875, recorded December 20, 1875.
Inheritance of appellees from T. W. House, whose heirs they are shown to be.
Appellants’ chain of title is as follows:
Power of attorney from the heirs of S. R. Walker (coupled with an interest) to G. A. Steinle, November 2, 1889, recorded December 4, 1889, authorizing sale and conveyance of the land in suit.
Deed from such heirs by Steinle, attorney in fact, to S. R. L. Cremer, December 27, 1889.
Deed from Cremer to W. L. Thulemeyer, December 20, 1890.
Appellant Berry claims under Thulemeyer.
Appellants also relied on proof, offered by them, that Cremer bought from Walker’s heirs for a valuable consideration, without notice of the prior conveyance from Walker to Garwood. As will be seen from the above statement, when Cremer received his deed the record of Garwood’s deed had been burned, and it had not been rerecorded.
Appellees relied upon circumstances to show that Cremer was chargeable with notice of their title; and further, that Steinle and Thulemeyer, knowing that appellees had the title to the land, entered into a conspiracy to deprive them of it and to acquire it for themselves, through the medium of Cremer, an ostensibly innocent purchaser.
The court below found in appellees’ favor upon the latter ground, holding, that while Cremer denied knowledge of the title in them, and paid Steinle $150 in cash, and gave him two notes for $995 each, for the land, he was in fact an instrument used by Steinle and Thulemeyer to thus take from appellees their property. It was shown, and the court found, that Cremer conveyed the land to ThuFemeyer for $300 cash and the assumption by the latter of the notes given by the former to Steinle, and that the land had since reverted to Steinle. There was other evidence upon which the court based its conclusion, and the question made by appellees is whether or not this finding was warranted by the proof.
We have fully considered the evidence contained in the record, and have come to the conclusion that the finding in this particular is sustained. It is unnecessary, and would be unprofitable, for us to enter upon a discussion of the facts.
The evidence as to the notoriety of appellees’ ownership and claim of the land in the neighborhood where it was situated was properly admitted and considered by the court. It was a proper circumstance, tending to show Steinle’s and Thulemeyer’s knowledge of the fact.
Upon the facts found there can be no doubt that the judgment rendered was the proper one. The series of conveyances through which Steinle and Thulemeyer ultimately procured deeds to themselves is to be regarded as constituting a single transaction, characterized and vitiated by the general purpose which actuated them. The interposition of a third person, as one of their instruments, can not add any strength to their claim, whether he knew of their purpose or not. His purchase is to be regarded as having been made for them, and their knowledge affected the transaction to which he was a party. The principle that an innocent purchaser from one having knowledge of a prior unrecorded deed, and that one who buys from an innocent purchaser, though himself having notice, takes good titles, are fully recognized, but they do not control this case, for the reasons given.
Delivered December 15, 1892.
This disposes of the case and renders a discussion of the other findings of the court unnecessary.
The judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed."
219224,Terry Smith et al. v. Orange Swan et al.,1893-03-30,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
This was a suit by appellants, as devisees and heirs of devisees under the will of Obedience Smith, against a number of defendants, to recover a tract of land which had belonged to their testatrix and had passed to plaintiffs under her will, subject to the powers therein conferred upon her executor to sell it.
All of the defendants except appellee Orange Swan either defaulted or recovered judgment under the statute of limitations. Swan had no title by limitation, and judgment was rendered for him upon the strength of his title otherwise shown, and this is the occasion of the present appeal, in which the only questions presented relate to the correctness of that part of the judgment.
The titles exhibited by the parties were as follows:
Obedience Smith died in 1847, leaving a will, which was duly probated the same year in Harris County. Hiram G-. Runnels was by the will made its executor, and duly qualified as such. The administration by him as executor was opened up in the County Court, and was never formally closed, some occasional orders being made, the last of which was in June, 1851.
The will contained the provision that the executor might cause certain lands in litigation, and such other as he might think proper, to be divided into town lots, and sell them for cash or credit, as he might elect; and further provided, that all the residue of the property of the testatrix should go to her children and grandchildren.
It is conceded that the property in controversy was embraced within the terms of the power given to the executor.
On April 21, 1848, the said Hiram G-. Runnels caused the land of Obedience Smith to be divided into town lots, of which the property sued for was designated as lot 37, and subsequently the said lot 37 was subdivided by plat or map, recorded in Harris County records of deeds, into smaller blocks and lots.
On the 16th of March, 1855, B. F. Tankersley, in the name of Hiram G. Runnels, executed and delivered to A. N. Smith a deed having the formal requisites of a deed of conveyance, which was duly acknowledged before W. R. Baker, clerk of the County Court of Harris County, on May 8, 1855, and was duly recorded on the same dajq purporting to convey from Hiram G. Runnels to A. M. Smith the lot 37 sued for by the plaintiffs, said deed reciting that it was executed for Hiram G. Runnels “by B. F. Tankersley, agent and attorney in fact;” also reciting a consideration paid of $105; and further reciting that the conveyance was made “by authority of the last will and testament of Obedience Smith, deceased.” No power of attorney appears of record, and search and inquiry were unsuccessful in discovering one—B. F. Tankersley, A. N. Smith, W. R. Baker, and Hiram G. Runnels having all died before the commencement of this suit; the said Hiram G. Runnels having died about the year 1860, and the said W. R. Baker shortly before the commencement of this suit.
On March 17, 1855, A. N. Smith made a deed for the same property to W. B. Baker and B. F. Tankersley, reciting a paid consideration of $155, which deed was recorded May 8, 1855. Tankersley died January 1, 1859. His heirs, on October 15, 1877, made a deed to W. B. Baker for the undivided half of the lot 37, reciting a consideration of $1000. This deed was recorded at the date of its execution.
It was further shown, that by the subdivision made by Eunnels of the lot 37, that lot was divided into twelve blocks of six lots and two fractional lots each, and that there had been from and under Baker to the time of trial about 186 transfers of various dates, all reciting valuable considerations, and duly spread upon the county records, for different parts of the lot claimed under the deed from Tankersley; that all of the defendants, except those who did not answer, claimed under Baker by regular chains of transfer for their respective tracts, duly registered.
The defendant Swan connected himself with Baker by regular transfers, the first of which, conveying title out of Baker, was of date December 29, 1886. Swan only claims an interest of two-thirds in three lots of the subdivision.
It was shown, that about the year 1870 possession of lot 37 was taken for and under Baker, claiming through the Tankersley deed; that the property was parcelle' out and sold to various persons, a lot or so to each, the purchasers building homes upon it and buying on installments; that nearly all of the lot 37 was thus peopled, and the defendants were all in possession, and are conceded to have title by limitation, except Swan, who has never had possession.
Since Baker acquired the land he and those claiming under him have paid the taxes and exercised ownership in all the usual modes, and none of the devisees under the will of Obedience Smith have, until this suit was commenced, objected or in any way asserted claim to the land or paid any taxes upon it. Eunnels, Tankersley, and Baker were' intimate and were related to the devisees of Obedience Smith. Tankersley was a prominent lawyer in Houston and the legal adviser of Eunnels.
In 1860 there was a suit for partition, to which all the devisees of Obedience Smith and W. E. Baker were parties, in which all the unsold portion of the lands of the testatrix were divided, not including that in controversy. The decree contained the following clause:
“ By consent of parties it is agreed, that this decree shall not affect the rights of any of the parties hereto to any lands belonging to the estate of Obedience Smith which may have been illegally sold by the executor or any one purporting to act for him.”
Upon this state of facts the question arises, did the deed from Tankersley, assuming to act as attorney in fact for the executor, pass to Smith title to the land ?
Appellants contend, that inasmuch as the will did not exempt the executor from the control of the Probate Court, no sale made by him under the power conferred by the will was valid without confirmation by that court. Both the Act of 1846, under which the will took effect, and the Act of 1848, in force when Tankersley executed the deed, authorized the exercise by executors of powers of sale conferred by wills. Hart. Dig., art. 1101; Pasch. Dig., art. 1324.
The provisions of the statutes requiring confirmation of sales apply to such sales only as must be authorized by the court. Hart. Dig., art. 1099; Pasch. Dig., art. 1327. Valid powers of sale given to executors by will are not revoked by the probate of the will, but may be exercised, though the administration of the estate is not by other provisions of the will taken out of the Probate Court.
The court below, therefore, correctly held, that the will clothed Runnels with the power to sell and convey the land without the sanction of the court.
The next contention of appellants is, that the deed from Tankersley to Smith, assuming the existence of a power of attorney from Runnels .to Tankersley, is void, because Runnels could not delegate the power of sale conferred upon him by the will.
It is undoubtedly true that a discretionary power of sale, such as that given to Runnels by this will, can not be delegated by the donee or trustee to another.
The negotiation of such a sale, and the arrangement of and agreement to all its details, must be done by the trustee himself. Acts which are merely mechanical or ministerial may be committed by the trustee to another; and this includes the mere act of executing and delivering the deed of conveyance where everything else is done by the trustee.
Where the trustee himself agrees upon and arranges the sale and settles all preliminaries involving the exercise of discretion, he may by agent perform the act of executing and delivering the deed. 1 Dev. on Deeds, 422, note 3; Hawley v. James, 5 Paige, 318.
Except in case of a deed thus executed, a conveyance by one claiming to act as attorney in fact of the donee or trustee of such a power as this, where the sale was neither made nor ratified by the trustee, would be void. And in the case above supposed, the production of the deed executed by the attorney in fact would not be sufficient evidence of title in the purchaser, but he would be required to produce evidence of the circumstances under which it was made to authorize and sustain it.
In the present case there was no direct proof of the existence of such circumstances; and the deed of Tankersley must be held insufficient to convey the title, unless such proof is supplied by presumption arising from lapse of time, possession held, ownership claimed and exercised under the deed, and from acquiescence of those adversely interested.
Had Runnels been the owner of the land, there can be no doubt that the former existence and authenticity of the power recited in Tankersley’s deed would be presumed upon facts much less cogent than those which this evidence discloses. Harrison v. McMurray, 71 Texas, 122; O’Donnell v. Johns, 76 Texas, 362.
We think the further proposition may be asserted, that had no such deed as this been produced and the proof had shown such facts as these,, coupled with a claim of ownership by Baker and his privies under a deed direct from Runnels, presumption of the execution of such a deed would be warranted. 2 Whart. on Ev., sec. 1353. Why, then, should not such a presumption be indulged of the existence of a power of attorney from Runnels to Tankersley, such as the law would authorize, empowering the latter to do the act of formally consummating a sale which the former had made ? All the facts which were necessary to uphold the deed might exist in paroi except the instrument conferring such a power, and the evidence of them therefore be more easily lost. If a writing may be presumed, why may not facts which would uphold it be supplied in the same manner ?
It may be conceded that a court would not presume the existence of an unlawful power. But if the proof warrants the presumption of a power and an adequate legal one might have existed, such a power, rather than an illegal one, should be presumed.
It is objected by appellants, that there is no evidence that they have known of or acquiesced in the claim of Baker and others claiming under the Tankersley conveyance. The facts in the case admit of no other inference but that they did.
For more than a third of a century they have not in any way asserted a claim to the property, which was theirs but for this conveyance, and which all this time has been openly claimed, used, and enjoyed by the claimants under such conveyance.
They must be held to have known of such claim and to have acquiesced in it, because otherwise it is to be presumed that they would have raised some objection. The fact that Swan has not been in possession of the small portion of the property claimed by him can not alter the case. The whole was claimed and possessed by Baker sufficiently to support the presumption.
The court decided correctly in presuming the existence of a valid power in Tankersley to execute the deed, and in rendering judgment for defendant.
Its judgment is therefore affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered March 30, 1893.
Appellants having filed a motion requesting this court to file conclusions of law and fact upon which the judgment was based, the court regarding the foregoing as a sufficient compliance with the law, adopted same as its conclusions, both upon the facts and the law applicable thereto.
Application to the Supreme Court for a writ of error was refused May 18, 1893."
216300,A. B. Hardin v. Emily C. Clark and Husband,1892-12-22,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
Action of trespass to try title for the recovery of 2312 acres of land out of the Roman de la Garza and the Fernando del Valle surveys, in Leon County, brought by the appellant. Defendants disclaimed as to 550 acres of said land, describing the same by metes and bounds, and as to the balance they pleaded not guilty and limitation of three, five, and ten years. W. M. Johnson and wife and others intervened and claimed title for themselves.
Trial was had before the court without a jury, May 14, 1891, and judgment was rendered in favor of the defendants against the plaintiff and intervenors. Plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial, which was overruled, and he now prosecutes this appeal. . Intervenors have not appealed.
1. Plaintiff’s title is derived from proceedings had in the Probate Court of Smith County, in the estate of John D. Stell, deceased, for the sale of the land in controvery as the property of said estate, for the pay*ment of a claim in favor of the heirs of N. G. Campbell, deceased.
2. On June 4, 1856, John D. Stell bought from Jesse Duren 3013 acres of land in Leon County, on the Trinity River, where he had a farm, and Duren executed to Mm a bond in the penal sum of $30,000, obligating himself to convey title as soon as the land could be “ surveyed and marked out and correctly designated.” The land in controversy is a part of this tract.
3. On November 22, 1859, Jesse Duren conveyed to John D. Stell, by deed filed for record August 1, 1860, and duly recorded in the record of deeds for Leon County, “ 5000 acres of land in Leon County, Texas, parts of the Roman de la Garza and Fernando del Yalle eleven league grants,” of which the 3013 acres above mentioned, and the land sued for, is a part. This deed is agreed to be common source. It is not set out in full, and the statement of it in the record does not show what the consideration for the land was, nor that a vendor’s lien was reserved to secure the purchase money.
4. John D. Stell sold the 5000 acres conveyed to him by Jesse Duren to J. H. Burnett and John F. Beavers, and conveyed the same to them by his deed, dated June 9, 1862, which was duly recorded in the record of deeds for Leon County. The statement of this deed given in the record does not show whether the purchase money was paid or not, and no vendor’s lien is reserved; but it appears from the testimony of John H. Burnett that the purchase money was not paid at the time. The land was sold to Burnett & Beavers at $3 per acre, and they at the same time bought negroes and stock and agricultural implements, making an aggregate of about $50,000, of which $1500 was paid in cash, and the balance was.evidenced by nine promissory notes for $5000 each, and one for $3500, from one to ten years after date. Beavers died before 1867, and Burnett became the executor of his will.
5. John D. Stell died October 28, 1862, leaving a will, which was probated in December, 1862, in the Probate Court of Smith County, and letters testamentary were granted to his brother, R. M. Stell, who was appointed executor by the will. Certain bequests were made in the will to the defendant Emily C. Clark and other children; and after providing for the payment of his just debts and said bequests, he provided for the remainder of the estate to be divided equally between his children, including his foster-son, John C. Cox, the son of his last wife, interveners to take share of their deceased father, James J. Stell. Mrs. Amanda Stell, wife of John D. Stell and mother of defendant Emily C. Clark, died January 17, 1862. She was the second wife of John D. Stell, and it was during his marriage with her that the land before mentioned was bought. The intervenors are the grandchildren of John D. Stell and the children of James J. Stell, a son of the first marriage.
6. On December 12, 1868, Elliott Shackelford, as administrator of N. G. Campbell, deceased, filed an application or petition in the Probate Court of Smith County, in the estate of John D. Stell, alleging that he was the legal holder and owner of a claim against the estate of John D. Stell, deceased, founded on two promissory notes executed by said John D. Stell, payable to Jesse Duren or bearer, dated June 4, 1856, due March 1, 1860 and 1861 respectively, which had been allowed by Robert M. Stell, the executor, on May 31, 1866, and approved by the chief justice of Smith County, and then amounted to the sum of $4112, principal and interest; that by reason of the approval of said claim it was established as a valid claim against said estate; and prayed that the administrator be ordered to pay the same.
On July 26, 1869, R. M. Stell, the executor, filed an amended answer to said application, in which it was alleged, that Shackelford was not and never had been the owner of said notes, either in his own right or as administrator of the estate of N. G. Campbell, deceased; that the notes belonged to the estate of Jesse Duren, deceased, and were in the possession of Donley & Anderson, attorneys at law, for collection for the Duren estate, and had been fully paid off and satisfied, and were not a valid claim against the estate of John D. Stell.
On the same day he filed an exhibit, in which, among other property, he returned as belonging to the estate about 4000 acres of land in Leon County, worth about $15,000; no money on hand; and valued assets of estate in his hands at $25,750. Said exhibit admits the acceptance and approval of the claim described in the application of Shackelford, but claimed that there should have been a credit thereon of $3000 in Confederate money, paid to Donley & Anderson, attorneys for W. H. Cundiff, administrator of the estate of Jesse Duren,"" deceased; also for a note of $150 against Jesse Duren; and finally settlement thereof with Duren’s administrator.
On hearing the application of Elliott Shackelford for an order requiring the executor to pay said claim, the court rendered judgment on July 29, 1869, that the plaintiff take nothing by his suit, and that it be dismissed at plaintiff’s cost. Plaintiff excepted and gave notice of appeal to the District Court of Smith County. The judgment recites facts in support of the conclusion of the court, that the administrator had in evidence a receipt from Duren’s administrator showing payment of the notes to Cundiff, administrator of Duren, and an order on Donley & Anderson, attorneys, from Cundiff for the notes constituting the claim; and also payment in the way of other notes to Donley & Anderson, which were accepted as part payment; and also probate of the claim by Cundiff, Duren’s administrator, showing that the notes belonged to Duren’s estate,- and not to plaintiff. The court thereupon concluded that the possession • of the claim was not sufficient evidence of ownership.
The only further action, except the orders of continuance, that appears to have been taken in the matter of the application of Elliott Shackelford against R. M. Stell, for the payment of said claim, is the following entry on the minutes of the District Court of Smith County:
“_E. Shackelford, Administrator, v. R. M. Stell, Administrator. — Order of District Court, Smith County, Texas. — The appealed case of E. Shackelford v. R. M. Stell, No. 1577, to the Probate Docket.”
Order made and dated July 28, 1873.
7. On the 7th day of December, 1870, B. F. Clark, the husband of the defendant Emily C. Clark, was appointed administrator of the estate of John D. Stell, deceased, with the will annexed.
8. On December 19, 1873, an order was made by the District Court of Smith County, in the succession of John D. Stell, deceased, in the matter of the petition of E. Shackelford, administrator of the estate of N. G. Campbell, deceased, for an order to sell land, requiring B. F. Clark, administrator of said estate, to sell 2000 acres of land, to be selected by him out of the survey lying in Leon County, known as the land granted to Roman de la Garza, and inventoried in said succession. The order recited that a necessity for said sale existed to pay the established indebtedness of the estate; and the administrator was ordered to report at the next term of the court.
9. The sale appeal’s to have been made and reported to the court, for on September 25, 1874, there was an order of the court, made by consent of parties, setting aside the sale, as shown in the report of sale filed September 23, 1874.
10. On June 30, 1876, the administration of the said estate was transferred to the County Court by a general order of the District Court.-
11. The heirs of Amanda Stell brought a suit in the District Court of Smith County, styled No. 2160, John C. Cox et al. v. B. F. Clark, administrator, et al., for the partition of 4460 acres of land in Leon County, Texas, belonging to the John D. Stell estate, and by decree of court, March 13, 1879, 2312 acres was set apart to them, being the same land described in plaintiff’s petition, and in controversy in this suit. The defendants in said partition suit were the heirs of John D. Stell by his first wife, and John H. Burnett. The memorandum decree in the record does not show whether or not Burnett was sued also in his capacity as executor of the will of Beavers. It states that suit was also against creditors of said estate, but no names of creditors are given.
12. Defendant Emily C. Clark entered into possession in the year 1879 of the 2312 acres above mentioned as having been set apart to the heirs of Amanda Stell by the decree of partition in the District Court of Smith County, and claimed the entire tract, except the 550 acres, as to which she disclaimed, having bought out the interests of her cotenants with her separate money, and paid taxes thereon every year from 1880 up to the time of the trial, and had held continuous possession thereof ever since 1879, holding and claiming it in her own separate right.
13. On April 5, 1880, A. J. Swan qualified as administrator of the said estate of John D. Stell, deceased.
14. R. M. Stell, executor of the will of John D.'Stell, brought suit in the District Court of Houston County against John II. Burnett, in his individual capacity and as executor of the will of John F. Beavers, deceased, on the notes executed for the property, including the land in Leon County, 5000 acres, purchased by Burnett & Beavers from John D. Stell; and on April 1, 1867, judgment was rendered in favor of said R. M. Stell as executor of John D. Stell, by confession, for the sum of $28,-205, with foreclosure of the vendor’s lien on the land conveyed to Burnett & Beavers.
15. Certified copies of returns of sheriff of Leon County on orders of sale issued on said judgment, August 1, 1881, and October 26, 1881, were put in evidence, which showed: (1) Return on order of sale issued August 1, 1881, returnable September 1, 1881, by order of A. J. Swan, administrator de bonis non of the estate of John D. Stell, deceased, upon suit of R. M. Stell, executor, v. John H. Burnett, executor, shows that the writ came to hand August 5, 1881, and was executed August 6, 1881, by levying on the land described in the judgment, and was returned for want of time to execute the same. (2) Return on order of sale issued October 26, 1881, returnable to the next term of the District Court of Houston County, shows that same came to the hands of the sheriff of Leon County on November 18, 1881, and was levied on said land, which was advertised for sale on Tuesday, December 6, 1881, and that said land was sold to A. J. Swan, administrator, for use of estate of John D. Stell, deceased, for the sum of $1000. Neither of the above mentioned writs were put in evidence.
16. J. N. Black, sheriff of Leon County, executed deed to A. J. Swan for the land, in accordance with sale as shown above, dated December 6, 1881, which was properly acknowledged and recorded.
17. On February 1, 1883, N. Campbell and others, as the only heirs at law of N. G-. Campbell, filed an application in the County Court of Smith County in the estate of John D. Stell, deceased, praying for an order of sale to sell lands belonging to said estate situated in Leon County, to satisfy two notes held by them, executed by John D. Stell to Jesse Duren, for the sum of $2000 each, dated June 4, 1856, payable to Jesse Duren or bearer on the 1st day of March, 1860 and 1861, respectively, with two credits endorsed by Jesse Duren, viz., November 22, 1859, $521, and January 4, 1864, $1000. They alleged that the claim for said notes was presented to R. M. Stell, as executor, for his acceptance thereof, on May 13, 1866, and that it was accepted, less a further credit of $324.34, leaving a balance due them of $3410.62; that on May 8, 1867, said claim was approved by the county judge for the amount allowed by the executor; that said notes were given for a part of the purchase money of the land in Leon County, 5000 acres, which was fully described, and prayed for an order to sell the same.
18. On May 12, 1884, the County Court of Smith County entered an order decreeing the sale of said land and the application of the proceeds of the sale to the payment of said claim, and that the administrator make report to the next term of the court. An order renewing said order of sale was made August 18, 1884.
19. A report of sale of said land was filed in said estate January 1, 1885, and order confirming the same was made January 19, 1885. The sale was shown to have been made on the first Tuesday in November, 1884, and the heirs, N. Campbell and others, became the purchasers.
20. The administrator, A. J. Swan, executed a deed in conformity with the order of the court for the land, 5000 acres, in consideration of the bid, $1300, to Mary Ann Crow, Emeline Chancellor, Delilah Boles, H. N. Campbell, Amanda Nichols, N. Campbell, and E. Campbell. Said deed was dated April 30, 1885, and conveyed the land above mentioned, being the same described in the deed from Duren to Stell in the judgment in Stell against Burnett, and in the application for sale and in the orders of the court directing and confirming sale.
21. A regular chain of title was shown from the grantees in the administrator’s deed conveying the land to the plaintiff, A. B. Hardin.
22. Mary Ann Crow, Emeline Chancellor, Delilah Boles, and Amanda Nichols were married women and under coverture from sometime before the defendant, Mrs. Clark, took possession of the land in 1879 until after their sale thereof. They sold, joined by their cotenants, first, an undivided one-half of the land on September 22, 1886, to John L. Henry, H. Gr. Robertson, and N. W. Finley; and afterwards, on July 18, 1889, by their attorney in fact, E. Campbell, and joined by Henry, Robertson, and Finley, who conveyed their one-half, they sold their remaining interest to plaintiff, A. B. Hardin.
23. It was not shown when or how N. Gr. Campbell came into possession of the claim for the payment of which the land was sold. It was never established by the court as a lien on the land.
24. It was shown that the defendant, Emily C. Clark, and other devisees and legatees in the will of John D. Stell, accepted the provision made for them in the will.
25. The judgment in favor of R. M. Stell, executor of the will of John D. Stell, deceased, against John H. Burnett, rendered in the District Court of Houston County, April 1, 1867, foreclosing a lien on the 5000 acres of land purchased by Burnett & Beavers from John D. Stell, was settled about December, 1868, and the land was reconveyed by Burnett to the executor of R. M. Stell.
Cbnclusio?is of law —1. Since the judgment in favor of R. M. Stell, executor, against John H. Burnett, foreclosing the vendor’s lien on the land, had been already settled, it would not support an order of sale or execution, and the sale by the sheriff of Leon County and his deed to A. J. Swan as the administrator of the estate of John D. Stell, deceased, were nullities; and said estate would have acquired no title to the land by virtue of said sale, even if an execution had been shown by which the sheriff was authorized to make the sale.
Delivered December 22, 1892.
2. Whether or not the defendant Emily C. Clark acquired a valid title as against the creditors of the estate of John D. Stell, by the judgment in the suit brought by her and other heirs of her mother Amanda Stell, deceased, against B. F. Clark, the administrator, and John H. Burnett and the heirs of John D. Stell by his first wife, it is not necessary to inquire, for she had a judgment against the administrator for the land, and took possession thereof, claiming the same adversely to the estate, and her title to the land became perfect by the statute of ten years limitation.
3. Mrs. Clark’s possession of the land might not have been considered adverse to the right of the estate to have the land sold under the judgment in favor of the estate against Burnett, foreclosing the vendor’s lien thereon; and if such sale had been valid, limitation might not have commenced to run until from the date of the sale, but as such sale was invalid, and said land was the property of the estate at the time it was set apart to the defendant in the partition suit, limitation commenced to run from the time that Mrs. Clark entered into possession, which was in 1879, soon after the partition had been made.
4. The claim for the payment of which the land was sold was never established as a lien thereon, and it was not shown that the notes upon which it was founded were ever executed for the purchase money, as contended by appellant; hence Mrs. Clark did not hold the land in subordination to a lien for the payment of the claim, and there was nothing to prevent the running of the statute in her favor.
5. Whatever cause of action the heirs of N. Gf. Campbell may have had for the land in controversy only accrued at the date of the acquisition of their title at the administrator’s sale, which was made on the first Tuesday in November, 1884, and confirmed January 19, 1885, and the deed executed April 30, 1885. Mrs. Clark was in possession then, and the cause of action having accrued subsequent to the commencement of the running of the statute in her favor, the coverture of the heirs who were married is no answer to proof of limitation.
The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.

219106,"Fordyce and Swanson, Receivers, v. B. L. Culver",1893-03-30,"GARRETT, Chief Justice
This suit was brought by B. L. Culver against the defendants, as receivers of the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway in Texas, to recover damages for personal injuries received by the plaintiff while in the employ of defendants and in the discharge of his duties as brakeman, and alleged to have been caused by a defective hand-hold upon a car which the plaintiff was mounting, by reason of the rotten condition of the wooden roof to which the hand-hold was attached by screws.
Trial was had by jury, and judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff upon a verdict in his favor for §5000.
Briefly stated, the facts are, that on the 28th day of May, 1890, the plaintiff was in the employment of the defendants in the capacity of brakeman. He was an experienced railroad man of eight or nine years service, and was familiar with the duties of brakeman. On that day, while attempting to go on top of a box car in the train upon which he was braking, the hand-hold on top of the car pulled out and plaintiff was thrown to the ground and seriously injured. The cause of the hand-hold pulling out was because the top of the car to which it had been screwed was rotten.
The condition of the hand-hold was not known to the plaintiff when he attempted to go on top of the car, and it was not open and patent to him, and under the circumstances he could not have known of it by the exercise of ordinary diligence. There was no rule of the defendants which required him to inspect the hand-hold or car before using the handhold. It was not customary to inspect the cars above the running gear at inspecting points, where the wheels and other running gear were inspected, but only when the cars were put on the repair tracks. Plaintiff was not a car inspector, but the brakemen were expected to report anything that they saw that was unsafe.
Plaintiff testified that he had noticed a good many roofs being rotten at times, and had seen some of the cars belonging to the system of which the railway in charge of defendants was a part with rotten roofs, and had worked on cars with rotten roofs, but had never noticed any hand-holds loose.
Plaintiff was hurt May 28, 1890, and the trial was had in February, 1891. Before the injury he had been a stout, healthy young man; but afterwards, up to the time of the trial, had been unable to do any work. He fell about sixteen feet, and in falling his right side struck on a flat car ■standing on a side track, and he then fell into a ditch alongside of the train, where he lay insensible, with blood running from his nose and mouth, until he was taken up and carried to the hospital. He had hemorrhages from the lungs on account of the injuries, shortly after-wards. He remained in the hospital about a month. He used crutches for awhile, but had discarded them. Dr. Baldwin examined him three or four months after the injury, and found him in a wretched state of health. He was considerably emaciated, had jaundice, and considerable trouble with his lungs. The doctor found his right lung in a congested state, and found scars located on the right side above the fifth or sixth rib, and right over the lung; the liver is just below this region. The lung was hepatized and consolidated, with very little air passing into it. It was caused by stasis, or stagnation of blood in the lungs. The other lung was clear and all right. It was the opinion of the physician that plaintiff’s condition was caused from a blow or injury; that-a blow was calculated to affect the lung by congestion. On further examination just before the trial, Dr. Baldwin found the condition of the lung still to be hepatized and consolidated in the lower part. Pleurisy, or inflammation of the pleura, was indicated. It was his opinion, that the lung was permanently injured, and on account thereof plaintiff was more liable to cold than if the lung was in its normal condition. It might take pneumonia. Plaintiff could not do the heavy work that he had done, and the lung would be always one great point in breaking down his health. Jaundice was merely a symptom of disease.
There was much other evidence. The effect of all is, however, that the plaintiff was very severely injured, and received internal injuries which resulted in permanently impairing the lower lobe of his right lung, and weakening him so that he would never be capable of doing heavy work again.
In view of the several assignments of error based on the charge of the court, it is set out in full, so far as pertinent.
“1. The servant in entering the employment of a railway company assumes all the ordinary hazards incident to his employment, but they must be such as are patent—such as he actually knows or could have known by the exercise of ordinary care, or would reasonably be presumed to know.
“ 2. The master is bound to use ordinary care to furnish suitable machinery and appliances for the safe discharge of the employe’s duty, and to keep them in proper repair, and if he fails to perform his duty in this respect, he is liable to the servant for any damages resulting from his neglect.
“ 3. Negligence, in a general sense, is every omission to perform a duty imposed by law for the protection of one’s own person or property or that of another. Negligence, to some extent, should be measured by the character, risk, and exposure of the business under consideration, and the degree of care of all parties is higher when the lives and limbs of themselves or others are endangered than in ordinary cases.
“4. Ordinary negligence is the want of such care and diligence as reasonably prudent men generally, in regard to the subject matter of injuries under such circumstances as those under consideration, would use to endeavor to prevent the injury complained of
“ 5. Contributory negligence is negligence not only upon the part of the one committing the injury, but also upon the part of him upon whom the injury is committed, and by which they both contribute thereto.
“6. One who is injured by the ordinary negligence of another can not recover damages therefor, if the injured party by his own ordinary negligence or willful wrong proximately contributed to the injury, so that it would not have happened but for his own fault.
“ 7. The law required of plaintiff, as brakeman, for his own safe protection, the use of such ordinary care in the performance of the duty of his position as prudent men under similar circumstances would employ.
“ 8. The master is called upon to use ordinary care, not only to furnish safe machinery for his servants, but he must also use this care to keep his cars and rolling stock in proper repair, and to employ competent men to inspect their cars, and the failure to perform this duty by their agent would be the failure of the master, that would make him liable if injury resulted to the servant.
“ 9. And the master’s duty is not performed simply by the employment of competent men to repair and inspect its cars, but must go farther, and see that the cars are actually kept in repair, and a failure so to do would make the master liable if injury results from such failure.
“ 10. If you believe from the testimony that plaintiff in the performance of his duty as brakeman, and without negligence on his part, started up the side of the car to set a brake, and when he got up and caught the top hand-rod, that said hand-rod pulled out by reason of the wood to which it was attached being rotten, and he fell to the ground and was injured, and that defendants were negligent as before explained in not keeping said hand-holds safely fastened to prevent injury, and plaintiff was injured thereby, defendants would be liable, and you will so find.
“11. If plaintiff, however, knew that said hand-hold was not properly fastened, or by the exercise of proper care could have known it, or was. negligent in ascending the stepladder, he can not recover. Plaintiff, however, was not called upon to inspect the car before ascending it to fix the brake, to ascertain its condition.
“ 12. If the wood to which the hand-hold was attached was rotten, but such defect was not patent, and defendants’ agents by the exercise of •ordinary care conld have discovered it, and failed to do so, and the plaintiff was injured, defendants would be liable. The defendants, however, would not be liable if they used ordinary care in inspecting the car and in keeping it in repair, nor would they be liable if the defect was hidden, and could not have been discovered by the exercise of ordinary care.”
The several questions presented by the appellant have been heretofore disposed of by this court in Fordyce v. Withers, 1 Texas Civ. App., 540.
An inspection of the entire charge will show that there was no error in the paragraph complained of under the third assignment of error, as follows: “And the master’s duty is not performed simply by the employment of competent men to repair and inspect its cars, but must go further, and see that the cars are actually kept in repair, and the failure so to do would make the master liable if any injury results from such failure.”
It was unquestionably the duty of the defendants to exercise reasonable care in seeing that the cars were kept in repair, and the charge, taken as a whole, imposes no greater duty upon them.
There is nothing in the evidence to support the contention of the appellants, that it was the duty of the brakeman to inspect the cars. There was no rule of the defendants to that effect; nor did it appear that the brakemen were also inspectors, or that inspection was expected of them. It was only expected that they would report anything that they saw that was unsafe.
The special instruction number 4 requested by the defendants, so far as applicable to the evidence, was included in the charge of the court in chief. It was to the effect, that if the jury believed from the evidence that the plaintiff had the same or equal means of knowing the condition of the hand-hold on the top of the car as did the defendants, and its defect therein was patent, open, and visible, then they should find for the defendants.
The seventh assignment of error is as follows:
“The court erred in its refusal to give special instruction number 6, requested by the defendants, wherein the jury were asked to be instructed substantially as follows: ‘ That if they should find from the evidence that
the top of the box car was rotten, and should further find that the plaintiff did not know that the top was rotten, yet if the evidence showed that at and prior to the time he received the injury he knew there were a number of cars on the road with rotten tops, and that in attempting to climb upon the same, in the way in which he was climbing when he was hurt, was liable to receive an injury by reason of the pulling out of the handhold on top of the car, then he assumed all risk incident to this condition of affairs, and if he was thereby injured he could not recover.’ ”
The instruction was not applicable. While plaintiff was aware of the rotten condition of the tops of some of the cars, it doés not follow that he knew that they were rotten where the hand-holds were attached. He said he had never noticed hand-holds loose; and the evidence does not show that the cars were so uniformly rotten as to establish a condition of which plaintiff was bound to take notice.
In the case of Railway v. Sommers, 71 Texas, 700, where it was shown that the plaintiff knew that many of the cattle guards were so constructed as to be dangerous to employes operating the train, it was 'held that such knowledge would put the employes upon notice of their construction generally. The cattle guards, however, were permanent in the nature of their structure, and it was held that a knowledge that many of them were constructed tad near the track would lead to a knowledge that all were constructed in the same manner. There was no error in refusing the charge asked.
Upon a careful consideration of all the evidence, we can not say that the verdict of the jury is so clearly excessive that we ought to set it aside.
We find no error for which the judgment ought to be reversed, and it will therefore be affirmed.

216231,"The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. Henry Schwabbe",1892-12-22,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
This action was brought by the appellee, in the District Court of Grimes County, March 17, 1890, to recover of the appellant damages for personal injuries received while appellee was in the employment of the appellant as an engine wiper and night watchman in its yard at Navasota, in Grimes County, on or about the 4th or 5th of October, 1889.
This appeal is from a judgment for the recovery of $3825 in behalf of the plaintiff below.
The injuries were received while the plaintiff was attempting to couple an engine and tender to a coal car, in obedience to the direction of one Housh, who was the foreman of defendant’s yard at Navasota, and at the time of the injury was operating the engine. A train was expected in from Conroe on the defendant’s line about 1 o’clock a. m., and the foreman, who went to sleep, had told plaintiff to wake him up when the train came in, which plaintiff did. Housh then told Corley, another engine wiper and night watchman, who was working with plaintiff, to throw the switch, and told plaintiff to couple the switch engine to the coal car, while he got on the engine and backed it up to the coal car, so that plaintiff might make the coupling. Plaintiff testified: “ Housh backed the engine towards the coal car and stopped about five feet from it. I hallooed to him to slow a little more back, and he backed the engine a little further, to about one and a half feet from the coal car, and stopped. I then hallooed to him to come a little more back, and he pulled the throttle open and came back so hard that he caught my left hand, with which I held the link, and shoved it, with the link, into the drawhead of the engine, and mashed it.”
As foreman of the yard, Housh had the authority to employ and discharge the engine wipers, who were under his charge. It was not plaintiff’s business to couple ears.
For the purpose of switching in the yard a switch engine is used. It has a sloping tank, so that one can see over the tender, and is safer to switch with than a road engine. The engine used when the accident occurred was an ordinary road engine. Plaintiff knew that switch engines were safer than road engines, and that coupling cars was dangerous work.
Plaintiff’s right of recovery is based on two grounds; first, the incompetency or negligence of the foreman Housh; second, the use by the defendant of a common road engine instead of a switch engine; and in the first instance, that it might result either from the negligence of the defendant, treating Housh as the fellow servant of plaintiff, in selecting and employing its servants, or treating Housh as a vice-principal, from the negligence of Housh in pulling open the throttle and backing the engine with too much force.
On the trial of the case, the court, in its charge to the jury, which is the basis of the second assignment of error, seems at first to have given an instruction on the theory that Housh was the fellow servant of the plaintiff; but the jury were afterward instructed that Housh was a vice principal and not the fellow servant of plaintiff. But the second assignment questions the charge for error in requiring too great care of railway companies in the employment of their servants and furnishing tools and appliances for them to work with. It is as follows: “ The railway company was bound in law to furnish competent and qualified men to handle its engines and trains at the yard at Navas ota, and was also bound in law to furnish means and appliances for switching trains which experienced railway men had found were safest and best adapted for that purpose; and if the company failed or was guilty of negligence in either regard in this paragraph named, and if from and by reason of said negligence injury resulted as a direct and proximate consequence thereof, the railway company is liable.”
This charge was error. Its effect was to instruct the jury that the failure “to furnish competent and qualified men to handle its engines and trains at the yard at Navasota,” and “to furnish means and appliances for switching trains which experienced railway men had found were safest for that purpose,” would be negligence on the part of the company. Such is not the rule, as has been frequently announced in the decisions of our Supreme Court. The company is only required, in the selection of its employes and in furnishing appliances to work with, to use such cave and caution in doing so as an ordinarily prudent man would use under the circumstances, and not absolutely to select competent men or furnish safe appliances. Railway v. Wells, 81 Texas, 685; Railway v. Bell, 75 Texas, 50.
That the use of a road engine was more dangerous than a switch engine was a fact equally as well known to plaintiff as to Housh, and the danger in its use was patent to the plaintiff; and such being the case, the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover on the ground that a road engine used for the purposes of switching involved him in greater danger than a switch engine. In the attempt to make the coupling he assumed the risk of danger, because the defect was open to him. He knew that it was a road engine and that a switch engine was safer than a road engine for the purpose of switching cars.
The charge complained of in the sixth and ninth assignments of error was wrong, and the requested instruction, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover on the ground of using a road engine instead of a switch engine, should have been given. Railway v. Brentford, 79 Texas, 619; Railway v. Somers, 71 Texas, 700; Rogers v. Railway, 76 Texas, 502.
The same principle will also apply to knowledge that the coemploye was not competent for the work to be done. Plaintiff knew that Housh was a machinist and not a regular engineer. If this rendered him incompetent, and plaintiff knew it, then he would be charged with knowledge of the danger in attempting to make the coupling with a man in charge of the engine who was not well qualified for the work, and will be held to have assumed the risk. If plaintiff undertook the work with patent and obvious danger, no amount of prudence on his part would relieve him of the risk; and the test is not whether a reasonably prudent man might have undertaken the work, but whether the danger was obvious and apparent, or in fact known to him. Railway v. Bradford, 66 Texas, 737.
The charge of the court complained of under the fourth, fifth, and seventh assignments of error had incorporated in it the idea that if the danger was not so patent and obvious that plaintiff, as a reasonably prudent man, might have undertaken the work, then he would not be charged with the risk, but would be entitled to recover. As we have seen, this was error. Again, although Housh may not have been well qualified for the work, and this fact was not known to the plaintiff, no recovery could be had except for negligence in handling the engine. If he handled it carefully and prudently, as an engineer of ordinary care and prudence would have done under the circumstances, then the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, even if the jury should believe that he was not well qualified for the work to be done. This would also apply in case he should be treated as a vice principal or representative of the defendant. Defendant requested instructions limiting its liability to the negligence of Housh, and they should have been given by the court; for, under the charges complained of, the jury may have found for the plaintiff if they believed the danger not so obvious or patent but that a man of ordinary prudence would have undertaken the work, and at the same time have believed that Housh was not guilty of negligence.
Appellant contends that the verdict of the jury is contrary to the law and the evidence, in that it shows that plaintiff, before he undertook to make the coupling in connection with Housh acting as engineer, had full knowledge of the fact that Housh was a machinist and not a regular engineer, having had such knowledge for several days or weeks prior to the night of the accident; and plaintiff, in undertaking to work with Housh as engineer under such circumstances, thereby assumed the risk of injury or accident by inability of Housh to properly handle the engine. As the case must be tried again, and the effect of such knowledge having already been determined, we do not deem it necessary to inquire whether or not the facts as shown on the last trial proved such knowledge. For the same reason, we do not pass on the eighteenth assignment, that the evidence shows that Housh was handling the engine with proper care, and the accident could not have been caused by any negligence of Housh, or on account of the road engine being used.
Appellant’s third, eighth, and eleventh assignments of error are:
“ 3. The court erred in charging the jury as follows: Under the facts in this case Housh was not a fellow servant of Schwabbe, but was Schwabbe’s superior, and was the representative of the defendant company; and if Housh directed Schwabbe to make the coupling, and Schwabbe attempted to do so, and while doing so you find that he was injured by the negligence of Housh in handling the car, or was injured by the unfitness and unsuitableness of the engine used, or that he was injured by means of the two forces combined, then the company is liable, unless you find for the company under the instructions hereinafter given.
“ 8. The court erred in charging the jury as follows: If you find that Housh did not handle the engine with the care and skill and prudence that an ordinarily prudent engineer would have .used under like circumstances, and that by reason of such negligence on Housh’s part, and without negligence on Schwabbe’s part, Schwabbe was injured, the defendant is liable.
“11. The court erred in refusing to give the first special charge requested by the defendant, which is as follows: In so far as the negligence complained of is concerned, Housh and plaintiff were fellow servants, and you will find a verdict for the defendant.”
Upon these assignments the appellant bases the following proposition: 11 The true test to determine who are fellow servants is to be found in the character of the act which causes the injury, and not in the grade, rank, or department of service of the person performing it. If the negligence causing the injury is the neglect of a duty which the master owes to his employes, the master is liable, whether the party guilty of the negligence is the master himself or a coemploye to whom he has committed the discharge of such duty; and if a coemploye, such coemploye is, as to the performance of such duty, a vice principal and not a fellow servant; but if the negligence causing the injury is not the neglect of a duty the master owes Ms employes, the master is only liable when he is personally guilty of the negligence, and not when it is the fault of a coemploye of the party injured; for all coemployes, whatever their grade, are fellow servants, except when engaged in the discharge of a duty the master owes'his employes. In other words, the same party may be in some matters a vice principal and in others a mere fellow servant, the test being, that in performing the duties which a master owes to the servant he is a vice principal; in the discharge of all other duties he is a fellow servant.”
Delivered December 22, 1892.
While we do not assent to the rule as stated in proposition of the appellant above quoted, still a majority of this court is of the opinion, that under the facts of this case Housh was the fellow servant of the plaintiff and not the representative of the company. In handling the engine Housh was not in the performance of any duty which the company owed to the plaintiff, but was engaged in doing an act as the fellow servant of the plaintiff, which, taken in connection with the act to be performed by the plaintiff, would result in switching the coal car from one track to another. Suppose a hostler had been on the engine, it would not be contended that the hostler and the engine wiper were not fellow servants. The only reason for the position that Housh was the representative of the company is, that he, as foreman of the yard, had authority to discharge the plaintiff, and the exercise of an act by him which would ordinarily be the act of a fellow servant is to be regarded as the act of the principal. It occurs to us that the difficulty lies in the failure to separate the individual as the person who handled the engine from himself as the foreman of the yard, charged with duties toward the plaintiff as the representative of the company.
If Housh was guilty of any negligence in backing the engine, it was that of a fellow servant, for which the defendant is not responsible.
It is not necessary to consider the remaining errors assigned. For the errors indicated, the judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded."
219222,Western Union Telegraph Company v. Frank J. Williford,1893-03-30,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
The appellee instituted suit against appellant for the recovery of damages sustained by him, as alleged, from the negligence of appellant in failing to deliver promptly the following telegram, addressed by S. E. Allen to appellee: “ How many beeves and bulls have you ? Don’t go away. Will get them off. Answer.”
The message was dated May 11, 1891, and was on same day, after nightfall, delivered to appellant’s operator at Harrisburg, in Harris County, with written request from the sender that it be sent at once to appellee at Stafford’s Point, where appellee was at the time holding a herd of cattle, while Allen was negotiating for their sale in the city of Houston. The cattle had been gathered for the purpose of delivering them to one who had contracted for them, but who had failed to comply with his contract. The plaintiff continued to hold the cattle until the 13th of May, 1891, on which day, not having heard from Allen, he turned the cattle loose, and went himself to Houston, and there learned that the cattle had been sold, the purchaser agreeing to pay $14 a head for the beeves and $10 for for the bulls.
The evidence shows that plaintiff called several times at the telegraph office at Stafford’s Point before he turned the cattle loose, and inquired if there was a telegram for him from Houston, and was told that there was not. It also appears that the operator, prior to his receipt of the telegram, was advised by the plaintiff that he was there for the purpose of selling and shipping his herd of cattle, and that he was expecting a telegram from Houston in regard to the shipment. The telegram was never delivered to plaintiff. The operator at Stafford testified, that he could not say whether he received the telegram on the 12th or 13th of May, but that he received it the same day that plaintiff turned his cattle loose and left for Houston; that he received it about 12 or 1 o’clock, and he immediately dispatched a messenger to the prairie with the telegram to be delivered to plaintiff, and the messenger returned without finding the plaintiff.
When plaintiff arrived in Houston he interviewed the appellant’s manager there in relation to the telegram which had been delivered to the operator at Harrisburg on the 11th day of May, with instructions to send to plaintiff at Stafford’s Point, and the manager informed plaintiff that for two days the operator at Houston had been calling the operator-at Stafford’s Point, but had been unable to obtain a response, and the manager supposed that the absence of the operator from his post was the reason why plaintiff had not received the telegram. By his not receiving the telegram, the plaintiff was deprived of the opportunity of completing the sale of his cattle which Allen had negotiated for him.
The plaintiff had in his herd about 178 beeves and 45 bulls. The bulls, as an indispensable preparation for shipment to market, had been dehorned, as bulls with their horns could not be shipped to market. The plaintiff upon the trial was permitted to show that the bulls with horns sawed off, in May, and turned upon the range in that section of the State, would suffer from flies, and that the probability was that not more than two-thirds of their number would survive the summer. The plaintiff was also allowed to show that it cost him $225 to collect and hold the herd at Stafford’s; there was evidence that plaintiff owned some of the bulls, and that he bought some of them, for which he paid $5 a head.
There was a verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $500; and a motion for a new trial being overruled, defendant appealed.
Several errors are assigned by the appellant, all of which may be considered under two heads:
First. The message did not on its face apprise the operator at Harrisburg that loss or damage would probably result to the vendee if the message was not promptly received by him, nor was there any extrinsic evideuce that the operator was informed of the nature and object of the telegram, and the necessity for its prompt delivery.
Second. That if the defendant be liable in damages for failure to deliver the message, the plaintiff can not recover the damages sued for, because the same are remote and speculative, and are not such as naturally result from breach of appellant’s contract to deliver the message.
The damages for which a party may recover for a breach of contract are such as ordinarily and naturally flow from its nonperformance. This has been a rule of law recognized by both English and American courts since the decision of the well known case of Hadley v. Baxendale, 9 Exch., 341, and the application of this rule to the case now under consideration restricts the plaintiff’s right of recovery to the difference between the market value of his cattle and the price he would have obtained for them had he been able to deliver them under the contract negotiated for him by his agent in the city of Houston.
We think, therefore, the court erred in permitting the plaintiff to show the cost incurred by him in gathering and holding the cattle at Stafford’s Point, and also his probable loss of bulls. For this error the cause must be reversed.
The plaintiff, in addition to nominal damages, will be entitled to recover, as we have said, the difference between the value of his cattle at Stafford’s Point in the condition they were in while on the land and the price he was to have received under the contract made by his agent, less the cost of transportation of the cattle to Houston, if the contract required that they be delivered in Houston.
To authorize a recovery for other than nominal damages from a telegraph company for failure to deliver promptly a message received by its operator for transmission over its wires, when the sender gives no explanation to the operator to whom the message is delivered of its nature and purpose, the message itself must upon its face advise the operator that it is in reference to a transaction from which loss or injury will probably result to the sender or him to whom it is sent, if the message is not promptly delivered. When we consider that in all telegraphic communications the utmost brevity of expression is cultivated, we are of the opinion that the message delivered to the operator on the 11th of May at Harrisburg, to be sent to the plaintiff at Stafford’s Point, does of itself advise the operator that it relates to a matter of business in which loss will probably result to either the sender or the plaintiff if the message is not promptly delivered; and if the failure to deliver the message to the plaintiff was the proximate cause of his not reaping the benefit of the contract of sale made for him by the sender of the message, the appellant is liable for such damages as naturally flow from the breach of cbntract.
It would be an unreasonable rule (as seems to be contended for by the appellant) to hold, that to make the telegraph company liable for failure to deliver the message, the operator must have been made acquainted with both the terms of the contract and the parties to it. Such a rule would, in our judgment, not only be unreasonable, b.ut inconsistent, with the uses and purposes of the telegraph.
The judgment of the lower court is reversed and remanded.
Beversed and remanded.
Delivered March 30, 1893."
219230,F. W. Schilling v. The State of Texas,1893-03-30,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
The State of Texas filed a petition, by the district attorney for the Twenty-third Judicial District, in the District Court of Wharton County, September 9, 1892, against Frank Page, and alleged that on or about July 26, 1882, the defendant, in accordance with an act of the Legislature approved July 8, 1879, to provide for the sale of the school land, and of the acts amendatory thereof, approved April 6, 1881, and Hay 6, 1882, applied for the purchase of alternate section 46, surveyed by virtue of certificate 114 for the Washington County Railway Company, situated in Wharton County; that this application ""Has duly recorded by the surveyor of said county, and the defendant executed and forwarded to the Treasurer of the State his obligation for the sum of $608, agreeing to pay the Governor of the State and his successors in office, on the first day of January of each year, one-twentieth of said sum, with interest on the full amount of the principal unpaid at the date of each payment of interest; and that said obligation and said application, and one-twentieth of the purchase money, to-wit, $32, were forwarded to the State Treasurer at Austin, and was by him received and receipted for, and said receipt and application were duly filed in the General Land Office on August 2, 1882, in accordance with law.
It was further alleged, that since March 1, 1888, the defendant had failed to pay interest, etc.; that the defendant had forfeited his claim to said land; and judgment was prayed for title and possession of the land, and that said sale and purchase be set aside, annulled, and declared forfeited.
Mary E. Kuykendall was also made a party defendant as claiming some interest in the land.
On October 12, 1892, the El Campo Land Company filed a petition in intervention, and claimed to be the owners of the land by purchase from the defendant Frank Page, and to have paid the balance of the purchase money and interest to the State.
On October 25, 1892, the appellant F. W. Schilling intervened in the suit. His first amended original petition in intervention was filed November 10, 1892. He alleged, that on the 9th day of September, 1892, he actually settled upon and occupied in good faith the said section 46 described in plaintiff’s petition, with the intent and purpose to make of said land a homestead by purchase under the acts for the sale of the public school lands of the State. Then followed allegations with respect to the purchase of the defendant Page, and his subsequent failure to pay the interest as alleged in the petition of the State, and averment that the said defendant bad forfeited his right to the land, etc. He further averred, ‘ ‘ that being advised of the forfeiture of said pretended purchase under the law by virtue of which said purchase wras made, and being so advised of the status of said defendant’s and intervenor’s title, if any they have ever had, which this intervenor denies, from the records of the General Land Oflice and State Treasurer’s office, the Commissioner of the General Land Office did, on September 3, 1892, in compliance with law, instruct the district attorney of the Twenty-third Judicial District to bring suit for possession of said tract of land, and for the ejectment of the defendant Page therefrom,” etc.; and that if the El Campo Land Company had paid the balance of the purchase money, the receipt thereof by the officer of the State was unauthorized and void. Further, 6 ‘ that he is now', and has been since the 9th day of September, 1892, an actual settler in good faith upon said described tract of land, having tendered to the Treasurer of the State the sum of $32, being one-fortieth of the- value thereof, together with his obligation for the remainder, as provided by law, which was refused until a copy of the judgment of ejectment was filed, as required by law. That there is not now and has never been any actual possession of said land either by defendant Page or any other person save your intervenor; and that he is actually residing thereon as his home, and desires to purchase same under the acts authorizing the sale of the public school lands of Texas.” He also replied to the plea in intervention of the El Campo Land Company by a general denial and plea of not guilty.
To said petition in intervention the defendant Page and the El Campo Land Company demurred: (1) That the petition was insufficient in law, and showed no right, title, nor interest in the land in controversy as against any of the other parties to the suit. (2) Because it did not state in what particulars the defendant Page or the intervenors failed to comply with the law in acquiring title to the land ""in controversy.
The case was called for trial on November 10, 1892, when the demurrers of the defendant Page and the El Campo Land Company to the petition of intervention by Schilling were heard and sustained; and then the district attorney, in behalf of the State, by reason of instructions from the State Treasurer and the Commissioner of the General Land Office, notifying him of the payment by defendant of the full amount of the balance of the purchase money and interest due on the land in controversy since the institution of the suit, and requesting him to discontinue this suit, which appears from the recitals in the judgment, refused to prosecute any further against the defendant or the El Campo Land Company, and judgment was entered in favor of such defendants; and Schilling having declined to amend, the El Campo Land Company was declared subrogated to the rights of the defendant Page, and judgment was rendered in its favor against all parties for the title and possession of the land.
The contention of appellant is, that the purchase became ipso facto forfeited by the failure of Page or of his vendees to make the payment of interest in accordance with the law; and that having settled on the land, and made application for the purchase and tendered the first payment and his note for the balance of the purchase money as required by law, he was entitled to recover the same.
The suit was instituted by the district attorney in accordance with section 12 of the Act of 1879 (Laws, page 26), under which the purchase was made, to have the forfeiture established. This section provides: “If, upon the 1st day of March following the maturity of any payment, the interest on money due has not been paid to the State Treasurer, and his receipt filed with the Commissioner of the General Land Office as provided in section 11 of this act, it shall be the duty of said Commissioner to notify the county or district attorney of the county in which such land is situated of such failure, giving the name of the purchaser so failing to make payment, with the amount and date of his note, and the amount of principal and interest due at the time of such failure; and upon the receipt of such notice it shall be the duty of the county or district attorney •to cause a writ to be issued and served on -the purchaser, or, in case of his death, upon his heirs or legal representatives, requiring him or them to show cause why he or they should not be ejected from such land; and upon his or their failure to show that the annual installments of interest have been paid as above provided, a judgment shall be rendered against him or them, and a writ of possession shall be issued in favor of the State. That a copy of such judgment, under the signature and seal of the clerk of the court rendering the judgment, shall be forwarded to the State Treasurer, who shall immediately endorse the obligation of such purchaser ‘forfeited,’ note the fact of such endorsement on the copy of judgment aforesaid, and forward the same to the Commissioner of the General Land Office. The said Commissioner shall file said copy of judgment with the claim of such defaulting purchaser, and shall note such forfeiture on the account kept with said purchaser, and shall notify the surveyor of the county in which said land is situated that said land is again for sale.”
It was a suit, therefore, to have the forfeiture of the purchase declared, and for the restoration of the land to the State. Although the act declares that upon the failure of the purchaser to show that the annual installments of interest have been paid as provided, judgment should be rendered against him, we do not think that the proviso does more than to require the payment of the money in the manner prescribed before the case has been called for trial.
The object of the statute was to sell the land and provide a fund for the common schools, and this purpose is made manifest by the subsequent laws declaring that there shall be no forfeiture for nonpayment of the principal and extending from time to time the payment of the interest. It was no doubt the intention of the Legislature in requiring the forfeiture to be ascertained in the District Court to afford the purchaser the opportunity of obtaining such equitable relief as he might show himself to be entitled to; and a familiar principle of relief belonging to equity is, that the vendee be allowed to complete his purchase by payment of the balance of the purchase"" money and interest. In submitting the matter to the courts it was not intended to deprive them of the exercise of the right to administer the same principles that apply to other cases coming within their jurisdiction.
We are furthermore of the opinion, that appellant’s petition in intervention did not show that he had acquired any right to the land. Whatever rights he acquired arose under the Act of 1887, amended in 1889. Laws 1887, p. 83; Laws 1889, p. 50. His petition does not show that the land was ever restored to the school fund by the filing of the copy of the judgment of forfeiture as prescribed in the Act of 1879; it does not show that the lands were ever classified or appraised, nor, except inferentially, at what price the land was to be sold by the State, which is to be inferred only from the amount of the cash payment which it was alleged had been tendered. He does not even allege that he had ever made application for the purchase of the land. The only allegations in the petition of appellant to show his right to the land were, that he was an actual settler thereon in good faith, with the intent and purpose to make the land a homestead by purchase under the acts for the sale of the public school land, having tendered to the Treasurer of the State the sum of $32, being one-fortieth of the value thereof, together with his obligation for the remainder, as provided by law.
His petition should show such facts as would entitle him to enforce his right to purchase the land, and in this respect it is fatally defective.
There was no error in sustaining the demurrers to the appellant’s petition in intervention, and the judgment of the court below will be affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered March 30, 1893."
216251,"The Texas Water and Gas Company, for use of T. R. Bonner et al. v. The City of Cleburne",1892-12-06,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This suit was brought, November 8, 1889, in the District Court of Johnson County, by the Texas Water and Gas Company, for the use of T. R. Bonner, E. C. Williams, and J. B. Henderson, against the city of Cleburne. The plaintiff prays as follows:
1. For a decree specifically enforcing a certain contract, by which the appellee agreed to issue and deliver fifty-one good and valid bonds of $1000 each, in payment for certain water works constructed for appellee by appellant, and for interest which has accrued upon said contract since its completion by appellant, and for a writ of mandamus to enforce such decree.
2. For the recovery of the value of said water works, alleged to be the sum of $51,000, in the event that the court should refuse specific performance.
3. For the recovery of the water works themselves, together with all the rents, issues, and profits, and the right to operate the same as now located in the city of Cleburne, in the event that the court should refuse to decree specific performance or to give judgment for the value of the water works.
The facts relied upon by appellant for recovery, as alleged in its petition, are as follows: On September 13, 1883, the city of Cleburne adopted an ordinance authorizing its mayor and city secretary to execute a cbntract with appellant for the construction of a system of water works, and on compliance by appellant with its contract, to execute and deliver to it fifty-one bonds for $1000 each, due twenty years after date, with forty coupons, for $35 each, attached to each bond, the coupons falling due semi-annually, the last maturing July 1, 1905.
The ordinance provided that the revenues realized from the operation of the water works, over and above the expenditures, should constitute a fund to pay the interest and create a sinking fund for the final redemption of the bonds. It further ordained, for the purpose of paying said interest, the levy of an annual tax of one-fourth of 1 per cent on each $100 worth of property in the city; and it further ordained, in order to pay said interest and to provide a sinking fund for the redemption of the bonds, the levy of an additional tax of one-tenth of 1 per cent, to be collected under the power of the city 1 ‘ to levy and collect annual taxes to defray the current expenses of the local government.” This levy of one-tenth of 1 per cent was to be inoperative if it should be found that the preceding levy would be sufficient to pay the interest and sinking fund referred to.
On September 13, 1883, the city of Cleburne, through its mayor, W. N. Hodge, and its city secretary, W. H. Graves, under the authority of said ordinance, entered into a contract with appellant. On the part of the Texas Water and Gas Company it was agreed to construct, on or before June 1, 1884, a complete system of water works, to be submitted to a prescribed test in the presence of a committee of aldermen of the city, on a favorable report from which the company was to be discharged from further obligation on the contract. On the part of the city it was agreed to deliver to the Texas Water and Gas Company, on its com-' pliance with the conditions named, the bonds and coupons described in the ordinance.
In pursuance of its contract, the company completed the water works by July 3, 1884, and submitted them to the test provided for; they were accepted by the city, which, in the language of the petition, “ took charge of them, and has ever since owned, held, and operated them as its own property and for its own use, benefit, and profit.”
On July 3, 1884, W. N. Hodge, as mayor, with the attestation of W. H. Graves, as city secretary of the city of Cleburne, delivered to the company the fifty-one bonds, together with the coupons, provided for in the contract and the ordinance. These bonds bear date January 1, 1884; they are endorsed 1 ‘ Registered on July 12, 1884. William J. Swain, Comptroller.” Each bond contains the recital that it is “ authorized by article 420, Revised Statutes of Texas, and by the ordinance already""set out in conformity to article 420.” Each also recites that it is secured by an ordinance of the city authorizing the levy and collection of a tax-of 35 cents on the $100 worth of property, to pay the interest and 2 per cent sinking fund.
The purported date of these bonds, January 1, 1884, is not their true date. They were actually signed July 3, 1884, when W. N. Hodge had ceased to be mayor. From the fact, however, that the bonds were issued under the contract of September 13, 1883, and were printed and engraved prior to the date, January 1, 1884, when Hodge was the mayor, the city council adopted a resolution authorizing W. N. Hodge to sign the bonds as mayor. By virtue of this resolution, W. N. Hodge signed the bonds as mayor, and they were delivered to the company and accepted by it as valid bonds in payment of the $51,000 stipulated for by the contract. After its acceptance of the bonds, the plaintiff sold all of them to the parties for whose use this suit is brought, and received for them the money therefor. These parties are now the bona fide owners and holders of thirty-three of the bonds, with all the coupons attached thereto, which represent the interest beginning and running from July 1, 1884, and maturing semi-annually on the first days of January and July.
In the latter part of the year 1884, certain coupons first maturing were cut and sold to W. N. Coler, Jr., a nonresident, who, payment being refused, brought suit in May, 1885, against the city of Cleburne in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas, to enforce the payment of the coupons. The suit so brought, No. 759, resulted, in February, 1887, in a verdict in favor of the defendant, on the ground that the bonds were not properly executed and that the coupons were void. From this judgment W. N. Coler, Jr., prosecuted an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, which, on May 13, 1889, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, holding the bonds to be void, because they were signed by W. N. Hodge as mayor, when in fact he was but a private citizen.
The plaintiff has in all things complied with its contract; it has completed the water works, which the defendant has accepted, used, and operated. The defendant has not paid the consideration of $51,000, according to the contract; it has not delivered fifty-one valid bonds, but it has issued fifty-one worthless bonds, which the plaintiff holds for the use of the parties named in this suit, and which, together with the coupons, plaintiff is ready to deliver up for cancellation. The defendant has paid no consideration for the water works, but has refused the demand of the plaintiff, made in the name and for the use of all the holders of the bonds, to execute and deliver fifty-one good and valid bonds according to its agreement.
The defendant city addressed to the petition a general demurrer and divers special exceptions, all of which were sustained. The action of the court in sustaining this demurrer and these exceptions gives rise to the questions which we shall proceed to consider.
1. Was the city of Cleburne empowered, under the Constitution and laws of the State, to enter into the contract set out in the plaintiff’s petition ? If it was not so authorized, the plaintiff is not entitled to the decree for specific performance for which it prays. If Cleburne was a city of more than 10,000 inhabitants, this question would require an answer in the affirmative, because cities of the latter class, at the date of this contract, were empowered, for municipal purposes, including the purpose of protection against fire, here in contemplation, to levy a tax of 2£ per cent, a limit far in excess of that named in the contract under consideration. Muller v. City of Denison, ante, 293.
The petition contains no averment that Cleburne is such a city, and the failure to so aver is the subject of appellee’s twelfth special exception. As the purpose of the suit is to enforce the performance of a contract by the city, it would devolve upon appellant to prove that Cleburne was a city such as could enter into the contract in question. Gould v. City of Paris, 68 Texas, 518. Such proof would require corresponding allegations, and in their absence the petition would be obnoxious, at least to special exception such as was addressed to it. The appellant urges that the court erred in sustaining the general demurrer to its petition in this respect, and invokes the doctrine that on general demurrer every reasonable intendment will be indulged in favor of the sufficiency of the petition. As, however, in connection with the general demurrer, the court acted upon the special exception referred to, and as the latter was properly sustained, we do not think that the principle of pleading invoked by appellant is applicable.
We are therefore to measure the authority of the city of Cleburne by the powers delegated to it as a city of 10,000 inhabitants or less, and, in this connection, to look to the constitutional and legislative provisions, the sole source of these powers. Article 420 of the Revised Statutes is the legislative authority relied upon to support the contract and the ordinance declared upon. The appellee contends that the constitutional provisions determining the authority of Cleburne were section 4, article 11, and section 9, article 8, of the Constitution of 1876, as it existed prior to the amendment of 1883; the appellant contends, on the other hand, that such authority is to be fixed by reference to these provisions of the Constitution as they existed after the amendment of 1883, enlarging the powers conferred upon municipalities in section 9, article 8.
Construing article 420 of the Revised Statutes and the two sections referred to of the Constitution as it existed previous to the amendment of 1883, Willie, Chief Justice, in Gould v. City of Paris, 68 Texas, 518, concluded, in effect, that a city having 10,000 inhabitants or less had not the power to levy an annual tax exceeding one-fourth of 1 per cent, ‘1 except for the payment of debts already incurred, and for the erection of public buildings.” Excluding these excepted purposes, the power of the city ceased with the levy of one-fourth of 1 per cent for current expenses. As the construction of a system of water works comes neither within the description “ debts previously incurred,” nor “erection of public buildings,” it follows, if the petition in this case shows that the taxes contemplated by the contract are in excess of the one-fourth of 1 percent allowed for “ current expenses,” and if the Constitution as it existed prior to the amendment of 1883 was in force, that the contract sued upon was void.
The power of the city to contract can not extend beyond the power of the city to tax. Gould v. City of Paris, 68 Texas, 516. The ordinance and the contract in question, as shown by the allegations of the petition, provided, first, for an absolute levy of one-fourth of 1 per cent, and, additionally, for a conditional levy of one-tenth of 1 per cent, the latter to be collected under the power to levy a tax to defray current expenses. It thus appears that the levy of one-fourth of 1 per cent was independent of the power to levy a tax for current expenses, and in excess of it, and that the levy of one-tenth of 1 per cent was contingent upon the levy of one-fourth of 1 per cent. Hence, we conclude that the tax provided for was unauthorized, and the contract was void, unless at the date thereof the Constitution as amended was in force. Under article 8, section 9, as amended, cities of the class of Cleburne were authorized, without reference to the tax for current expenses, to levy a tax not exceeding “ 25 cents on the $100, for the erection of public buildings, streets, sewers, and other public improvements;” the term “ public improvements,” including, as we think, such improvements as a system of water works. We will therefore consider the proposition of appellant, that the constitutional amendment was operative at the date of the contract alleged.
The amendment in question was submitted by the Legislature April 7, 1883; it was ratified by vote August 14, 1883, and the result of the election in favor of its adoption was announced in the Governor’s proclamation September 25, 1883. The contract in question was entered into September 13, 1883. Article 17, section 1, of the Constitution, requires, when a vote has been had on the question of adopting a constitutional amendment, that the several returning officers shall make returns to the Secretary of State, whose duty it becomes (under article 1710, Revised Statutes), to count the returns of the election on the fortieth day after the election, and not before, excluding the day thereof. ‘ ‘And if it shall appear from said returns that a majority of the votes cast have been cast in favor of any amendment, the said amendment so receiving a majority of the votes shall become a part of this Constitution, and proclamation shall be made by the Governor thereof.” Article 17, as a part of the Constitution itself, must be deemed the expression of the people as to when their will, with reference to a change in the organic law, shall take effect. Its purpose, evidently, was to avoid that confusion which would probably result from too sudden a change in the frame of government, and which is naturally incident to the going out of the old order and the coming in of the new. Our Court of Appeals has, therefore, correctly held that the constitutional amendment does not become operative until after the lapse of the forty days above referred to. Sewell v. The State, 15 Texas Ct. App., 56; Wilson v. The State, 15 Texas Ct. App., 150; see also Real v. The People, 42 N. Y., 270.
The rights, powers, and duties of the city of Cleburne under the contract are consequently to be considered without regard to the amendment of 1883.
Appellant insists, however, that “the acts of performance (stated in the petition) are in themselves the creation of a contract, or such a ratification of the original as declare it a contract made after the amendment became a law.” These acts are as follows:
(1) After the completion of the water works, in July, 1884, they were submitted to a test to prove their efficiency, in accordance with the terms of the contract, and they were accepted by the city, which ‘ ‘ took charge of them and has ever since held, owned, and operated them as its own property, and for its use, benefit, and profit.”
(2) At said date, in July, 1884, the city council adopted a resolution empowering W. N. Hodge, as mayor, to sign the bonds provided for in the contract of September 13, 1883.
As already stated, the authority under which it is claimed that this contract was made is contained in article 420 of the Revised Statutes. This article empowers the city to issue coupon bonds for the purpose of erecting water works; “provided, that the aggregate amount of bonds shall not at any time exceed 6 per cent of the value of the property within said city subject to an ‘ ad valorem ’ tax.” It is further provided in article 427 of the Revised Statutes, that “No debt shall ever be created by any city unless at the same time provision be made to assess and collect annually a sufficient sum to pay the annual interest thereon and create a sinking fund to pay 2 per cent thereon.” These are conditions upon which the power exists to issue the bonds or contract the indebtedness. City of Terrell v. Dessaint, 71 Texas, 770. The petition nowhere shows the value of the property within the city of Cleburne, nor is it alleged in connection with the foregoing facts that any provision was made to pay the debt in contemplation. The appellee, in its twelfth special exception, assails the petition as insufficient, because it does not allege any facts which would have authorized the defendant to create the indebtedness at the time of making the contract, or passing the ordinance, or issuing the bonds, or of the attempted creation of the indebtedness.
Where one seeks to enforce an executory contract against a city, he must show that the contract is authorized by the statute, and where the existence of conditions is made, by statutory or organic law, necessary to the execution of the contract, he must aver such existence. A general allegation of authority is insufficient. Dill, on Mun. Cofp., sec. 509. It is essential that the mode prescribed by law in regard to municipal contracts be followed as well in the ratification as in the creation of the contract. 15 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 1086. The acts referred to under the deficient allegations of the petition are therefore certainly insufficient to create or ratify the contract.
2. The second prayer of appellant’s petition invites a discussion of the following question: Does the petition show that the city is bound by an implied contract for the value of the water works ? We do not, however, deem it necessary to discuss this question. If we grant that the facts alleged show an implied obligation, we are nevertheless constrained to sustain the defense of limitation urged by special exception to the demand. Bonner, Williams, and Henderson, for whose use this suit is brought, occupy an attitude certainly not more advantageous than the Texas Water and Gas Company, through which their rights arise. The implied liability to pay for the water works would exist, if at all, from the time that they were first accepted and appropriated by the city; and the cause of action upon such liability would be barred in two years. Gould v. Paris, 68 Texas, 511. The petition, therefore, showing that more than two years had elapsed after the accrual of the cause of action and before the bringing of this suit, the bar is complete.
3. We finally consider the question whether, under the facts stated in the petition, appellant is entitled to recover the water works themselves ? To this demand the city, by special exception, also interposes the defense of limitation. As already stated, the petition alleges, in effect, that on the 3d day of July, 1884, more than five years before the institution of this suit, the water works were accepted by the city, and “the city took charge of them and has ever since held, owned, and operated them as its own property, and for its own use, benefit, and profit.” The possession thus indicated was “hostile, actual, visible, notorious, and exclusive, continuous, and under a claim of title.’ ’ All the elements of adverse possession coexist. 1 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 228. If, therefore, the water works are to be regarded as personal property, the statute of two years applies, and the bar is complete against this demand. Connor v. Hawkins, 71 Texas, 582. ,
Delivered December 6, 1892.
If, on the other hand, as appellant strenuously insists, the water works are to be considered a part of the realty, because attached as fixtures to the freehold, what is the consequence ? The realty to which they are so attached, and of which they are become a part, was and is necessarily held and owned by the city for public use. The city council could not, by contract, surrender its control over such property to any individual or corporation. Macdonell v. Railway, 60 Texas, 590. A judgment, therefore, compelling it to do that which by contract it was not authorized to do, or that which by law it is forbidden to do, could not be justified.
In conclusion, we are of opinion that if the facts stated in the petition could entitle the plaintiff to any relief, it would be solely by virtue of an implied contract; and that, as the cause of action founded upon the implied contract, if it existed (which we do not decide), is clearly barred by the statute of limitation of two years, the judgment must be affirmed.
It is consequently so ordered.
Affirmed."
219104,T. J. Grizzard v. B. W. Brown,1893-03-30,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellant, a citizen of Georgia, sued appellee, a citizen of the same State, in the County Court of Montgomery County, on certain promissory notes, alleging that appellee owned a tract of land situated in that county, which was described in the petition, and praying for the issuance of an attachment to be levied upon it.
The writ was duly issued and levied upon the land, and personal notice was served on appellee in Georgia, as provided by statute. He appeared and excepted to the jurisdiction of the court, on the ground that the petition showed that both plaintiff and defendant were nonresidents, and the court had no jurisdiction over their persons and none to foreclose an attachment lien on land, and could therefore acquire none over the property attached. On the same day he filed a motion to quash the attachment upon the same ground; and also filed another answer, in which he demurred to and answered the petition on its merits.
In both the two first mentioned pleadings he stated that he appeared for the purposes expressed therein alone, and in his other answer he stated that it was filed without any intention of waiving his other pleas, and that he thus answered to the merits only in the event they should be overruled.
The court sustained the plea to the jurisdiction, and entered judgment dismissing the cause, from which this appeal is prosecuted.
The ruling of the County Court was probably based upon decisions of the Court of Appeals, as formerly constituted, holding that the County Court had no jurisdiction to foreclose attachment liens on land. 2 Will-son’s C. C., 126-297. ■
The Supreme Court has never held to that view of the law, a conflict having existed on that point between its decisions and those of the Court, of Appeals. Hillebrand v. McMahan, 59 Texas, 450.
A statute was passed to remedy the difficulty, the effect of which we need not consider, inasmuch as we think it proper to follow on this question the rulings of the Supreme Court, and to hold that the County Court had jurisdiction to cause the levy of its writs upon land, and to enforce the levy by foreclosure of liens thereby created. Say les’ Civ. Stats., art. 180a.
One nonresident, by an attachment proceeding, may subject the property of another nonresident, who is his debtor, to the payment of his debt in any court of competent jurisdiction in this State. Ward v. Lathrop, 11 Texas, 287; Wells on Jur., sec. 114.
By the levy of its writ the court acquired jurisdiction over the property, and could subject it to the payment of such debt as the plaintiff might establish.
Counsel for appellant claims that by pleading as he did, the defendant entered an appearance such as gave the court jurisdiction over his person; and under the construction which our statutory provisions prescribing the effect of an answer have received from the courts, we are of the opinion that his position is well taken.
If the County Court had in fact been without jurisdiction to foreclose the attachment lien, and the pleading had only been such as was proper to secure the release oí an illegal levy, a different question would be presented, which we need not determine.
This levy was made under a writ issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction, and brought the property within the proper control of the court for the purpose of subjecting it to the debt.
The pleadings filed were no less voluntary than were those in the cases in which the filing of pleas to the jurisdiction have been held to constitute an appearance. York v. The State, 73 Texas, 657; 137 U. S., 15; Sam v. Hochstadler, 76 Texas, 162.
The County Court, therefore, has jurisdiction not only to subject the property, but to render such personal judgment as the facts may require.
Reversed and remanded.

219227,The San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company et al. v. H. F. MacGregor,1893-03-30,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Defendant in error, MacGregor, brought this suit against the plaintiffs in error, the railway company, and Yoakum and MacNamara, its receivers, to recover a tract of 41 acres of land near the city of Houston, and damages caused by the construction of the railway across it.
The defendants filed pleadings for the purpose of obtaining a condemnation of a strip 50 feet wide across the tract for its use as a right of way.
Upon a trial a verdict was rendered in favor of the company condemning the right of way, and in favor of the plaintiff for $4000 as the value of the land thus taken and damages to the remainder of the tract resulting from the location of the road upon it. The evidence as to the value of the portion of the land occupied by the defendant as right of way, and as to the injury to the value of the remainder of the tract caused by the road upon it, was conflicting. There was ample testimony to sustain the verdict of the jury, and we conclude that the damages amounted to $4000.
The only questions of law presented relate to the admission of evidence at the trial.
The first, second, and fourth assignments of error complain of the overruling of objections to questions asked plaintiff while testifying as a witness. The objection was that the questions called for the opinion of the witness as to the extent to which the property had been damaged.
A witness may give his opinion concerning the value of the property; and in this case it was competent for the plaintiff to state his opinion as to the value of the land without the road upon it, and the extent to which such value had been diminished by the road. This we understand the witness to have done throughout his testimony.
It is not regular, in suits for damages, to ask witnesses to state the amount of damage which has resulted from given acts, because the witness may give his conclusion based upon improper standards, or upon facts which should be submitted to the jury. For this reason the form of the questions asked was objectionable. They should have called for the opinion of the witness as to the value of the property, and as to any deterioration in such value resulting from the maintaining of the road upon the land, rather than his general conclusion as to the amount of the damage he had sustained. But, as above pointed out, the witness answered as to value, and gave his opinion upon that alone. The error was therefore harmless.
The evidence referred to in the third assignment, as to the purposes for which the land was valuable, was properly admitted.
The judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed.

219243,The State of Texas v. The Cherokee Manufacturing Company,1893-03-30,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
This suit was brought on open account for work done and material furnished by appellant to appellee. The petition set out an itemized account of material furnished by the financial agent of the two penitentiaries owned by the State to the Cherokee Iron Manufacturing Company, a corporation chartered under the laws of Texas, and domiciled in Cherokee County. The account runs from February 16, 1891, to January 13, 1892, and consists of machinery, iron, wood, water pipes, tools, engines, and various other articles manufactured both of wood and metal. The account aggregated the sum of 822,189.60, and showed credits to the amount of 815,134.19. This account was sworn to, and duly filed and recorded in book of mechanics’ liens, in the county clerk’s office of Cherokee County on the 21st day of January, 1892.
The petition prayed for judgment for the balance still due on the account, to-wit, the sum of 87055 41, with legal interest. The petition further averred, that the articles named in said account were furnished by the appellant, through its duly and legally authorized agents, to the appellee, under contract with it to furnish material for the erection of the furnace owned and operated by the appellee at New Birmingham, in the said county of Cherokee, and that said articles so furnished were used Tby the appellee in building and operating said furnace. The lot upon which the furnace is situated is fully described in the petition, and prayer is made for decree foreclosing lien upon said lot, its improvements, and fixtures.
To this petition the defendant in the court below filed the following demurrers:
“ Now comes the defendant in the above entitled and numbered cause, and excepting to the plaintiff’s petition filed herein April 19, 1892, says the same is wholly insufficient in law; a.nd of this prays the judgment of the court. Specially excepting to all that part of said petition which attempts to set up and claim a mechanic’s or material man’s lien on property therein described, defendant says the same is insufficient in the following particulars:
“1. It appears from said petition and the exhibit thereto attached, that plaintiff claims said lien under a contract alleged to have been entered into with defendant, but it does not appear therefrom that said contract is not in writing, nor are such facts stated therein as entitle plaintiff to the lien claimed if said contract is not in writing.
“2. It appears from said petition and the exhibit thereto attached, that plaintiff claims said lien under a contract alleged to have been entered into with defendant, but it does not appear therefrom that such contract is in writing, and if it is, that the requirements of the law necessary to fix such lien thereunder have been complied with. Of this the defendant prays the judgment of the court.”
The demurrers were sustained, and plaintiff excepted. The defendant admitted an indebtedness of $5327.69, which was accepted as correct by plaintiff, and judgment was rendered for that sum, but without a decree establishing and foreclosing a lien upon the property of defendant. A motion for a new trial was made by the plaintiff, which was refused, and the State gave notice of appeal.
The law upon which the appellant bases its right to a lien is that contained in section 37 of article 16 of the Constitution of the State, and the act of the Legislature entitled 1 ‘An act to ¿provide for the speedy and efficient enforcement of the liens of mechanics, contractors, subcontractors, builders, laborers, and material men, and to repeal all existing laws and parts of laws in conflict with the provisions of this act,” and approved April 5, 1889. The first section of this act is in these words:
“ Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That any person or firm, lumber dealer, artisan, laborer, mechanic, or subcontractor who may labor or furnish material, machinery, fixtures, or tools to erect any house or improvement, or to repair any building or improvement whatever, under or by virtue of contract with the owner or his agent, trustee, contractor, or contractors, upon complying with the provisions of this act shall have a lien upon such house, building, fixtures, or improvements, and shall also have a lien on the lot or lots of land necessarily connected therewith, to secure payment for labor done, lumber, material, machinery, or fixtures and tools furnished for- construction or repair.”
The second section of the act requires that any original contractor desiring to avail himself of its benefits, shall file within four months after the indebtedness shall have accrued his contract in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the property on which a lien is sought to be established is situate, and cause the same to be recorded in a book to be kept by the clerk for that purpose. This section requires this to be done by a journeyman, day-laborer, or other person seeking to establish a lien, within thirty days after the accrual of his indebtedness, with the proviso, that if such journeyman, day-laborer, or other person have no written contract, it shall be sufficient for him to file an itemized account of his claim, supported by affidavit, showing that the account is just and correct, and that all just and lawful offsets, payments, and credits known to affiant have been allowed.
Section 4 of the act is as follows: “ If there be no written contract, it shall be the duty of the person seeking to obtain the benefits of this act to deliver to the clerk of the County Court a sworn account as provided for in sections 2 and 3, to be filed and recorded as therein provided; and in such case, when the labor is performed for or the material is furnished to the owner of the building or improvement, the following form may be used, and will be sufficient to fix the lien contemplated by this act:
“ The State of Texas,-County.—A. 33., affiant, makes oath and says, that the annexed is a true and correct account of the labor performed (or material furnished) C. D., of - County, Texas, and that the prices thereof as set forth in said account hereto annexed are just and reasonable, and the same is unpaid; that said labor was performed (or material furnished, or both) for said C. D. at the time in said account mentioned, under and by virtue of a contract between affiant and C. D., and that due notice was given by affiant of the labor performed or material furnished, in accordance with section 3; and affiant further makes oath and says, that he is informed and believes that C. D. was at the time said contract was made and entered into and said labor was performed (or material furnished) the owner of the house or improvements described as follows (here describe the house or improvements), and that said house (or improvements) is situated upon a certain lot or tract of land which affiant is informed is owned by C. D., and which is described as follows (here describe the lot or tract of land); and this affiant claims a lien upon said house (or improvements) and upon said land; provided, however, a substantial compliance with the above form shall be deemed sufficient.”
There is no appearance for the appellee in this court, and the record does not disclose the grounds upon which the judgment of the court sustaining the demurrers to the petition is based; but we infer that the court held that a material man’s lien could not be enforced by an original contractor unless the contract be in writing. We do not think the sections of the Act of April 5, 1889, which we have quoted above, will admit of this construction. But if the court sustained the demurrers because the petition did not show that the contract between the plaintiff and the appellee was not in writing, we are of the opinion that the petition by its averments, with its exhibit and the attached affidavit, does show that the contract was in paroi and not in writing.
We have inspected carefully the pleadings of both the plaintiff and defendant, and we find that the petition avers every fact required by the statute for fixing and establishing a material man’s lien.
The Constitution gives the lien, and the office of the statute is simply to prescribe the mode in which such lien is to be fixed and secured.
The Constitution makes no distinction between those who contract in writing and those who contract by paroi; and the statute provides for fixing and enforcing liens claimed under either a written or a verbal contract; but it does not require that the contract must be in writing when made between an original contractor and the owner of the property, for furnishing material or labor.
The judgment of the lower court is reversed and remanded.
Reversed and remanded.

216272,Mrs. Ella Fox v. M. C. Brady et al.,1892-12-06,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
In the year 1869, B. J. Chambers, as agent of Nat Henderson, conveyed to Mary M. Wynne a tract of 6 acres of land in the town of Cleburne, Johnson County, the deed reciting a cash consideration of $57. At that time Mary M. Wynne was the wife of Peter W. Wynne, and they were living together as husband and wife, and that relation continued between them until about the year 1885 or 1886 (when Peter W. Wynne seems to have died), less than five years before the institution of this suit. Mary M. Wynne died in December, 1887. The deed on its face did not show that she was a married woman, nor did it show any fact which would make the land her separate property. Chambers testified on the trial that he had no distinct recollection of the transaction, but that his recollection was that Peter W. Wynne requested him to make the deed to his wife Mary M. Wynne. This deed to Mary M. Wynne was made in the summer of 1869, and in October of that year, in consideration of $1, and love and affection, she conveyed the property to her son-in-law, Benjamin F. Fox, the husband of appellant, which deed was acknowledged before her husband Peter W. Wynne, county clerk of Johnson County, and by him recorded; but he did not join her in the deed. In the spring of 1870, Benjamin F. Fox conveyed the property to Jeff Wright, in consideration of $125, which deed was likewise acknowledged before and recorded by Peter W. Wynne, and the evidence also tended to show that he wrote this deed. Thereafter appellees acquired different portions of the land under conveyances from and under Jeff Wright, for which they seem to have paid value, purchasing in good faith, without any actual knowledge of the facts which would render their titles defective. It was also admitted and proved that their possession was sufficient, in length and in character, to sustain their pleas of limitation of five and ten years, provided the statute of limitation was applicable to the facts of this case. Benjamin F. Fox, the son-in-law, seems to have abandoned his wife, and refused to join in this suit. Upon testimony sustaining these conclusions, the case was submitted to the jury, and upon their verdict in favor of appellees judgment was entered, from which this appeal is prosecuted.
The first assignment of error complains that the court erred in excluding portions of the depositions of Benjamin F. Fox and his wife Ella Fox, which portions are fully set forth in the bill of exceptions; but this bill, if indeed it can properly be called a bill of exceptions, does not show that the testimony was excluded, or that any objection was made to its introduction, nor that any exception was taken to its exclusion, if excluded. It follows, under the well settled rules of practice, that this assignment can not therefore be sustained.
The second assignment of error complains of the following charge:
“ The court instructs you, that if you believe from the evidence that the land sued for was the community property of Mary M. Wynne and her husband Peter W. Wynne, if you find she had a husband at the time she made the deed to B. F. Fox, and that her said husband took her acknowledgment to said deed; and shall also believe from the evidence that said Fox sold and deeded said land to Jeff Wright, and that Peter W. Wynne wrote said deed and took the acknowledgment of said Fox to said deed made to Wright, then you will find for defendants.”
The objection to this and other charges, on the ground, as alleged by appellant, that because both parties claimed under the deed to Mary M. Wynne as a common source of title they were erroneous, we think is not well taken. We can not perceive how the claim by appellees under this deed as a common source could be construed to be inconsistent with their claim that the property conveyed was community property. We are of opinion, however, that the charge is erroneous as being upon the weight of the evidence. It seems to have been held at an early day in this State, that where the title to community property is in the wife, she might, by the consent of her husband, dispose of it without his formally joining her in the conveyance. Thomas, Admr., v. Chance, 11 Texas, 634; Berry v. Wright, 14 Texas, 274. Doubtless this was the principle which the court intended to embody in the charge quoted above. We think, however, that he should have left it to the jury to infer the consent of the husband from the facts and circumstances introduced in evidence, and not have instructed them, in effect, that the facts from which they might infer such consent amounted as a matter of law to consent.
The refusal to give appellant’s first special instruction, of which complaint is made in her third assignment, was not error, because this requested charge contained the erroneous theory of appellant in relation to the doctrine of common source of title indicated above.
The remaining assignments, to-wit, the fourth and fifth, complain further of the court’s charge, and of the refusal to give appellant’s second special instruction. We are of opinion that this special instruction should have been given. While, as copied in the transcript, it contains some verbal inaccuracies, it substantially requested the court to charge the jury that- if it was the intention of Peter W. Wynne when the land was conveyed to his wife to donate it to her, it would amount to a gift and make it her separate property. It is true that in the court’s charge the jury were instructed in a general way that if the land was given to her by her husband it would be her separate property, but we think that this did not sufficiently direct the mind of the jury to the purpose of Peter W. Wynne in having the conveyance taken in the name of his wife, and especially so, in view of the further charge given by the court, that where a deed is made to the wife and there is no language in the deed tending to show that it is the separate property of the wife, the presumption is that it is the community property of the husband and wife.
Plaintiff’s case in the trial court depended upon a proper determination of this -issue as to whether the presumption of community property was rebutted by proof showing that in taking the deed in the name of Mary M. Wynne the intention was to make it her separate property. The fact that Peter W. Wynne requested the deed made in that way, and the further fact that only a few months thereafter his wife, without his joinder, and apparently with his consent, made a deed of gift of the property to her son-in-law, were proper matters for the consideration of the jury, under a proper instruction, in arriving at the intention of Peter W. Wynne in having the deed taken in the name of his wife. Higgins v. Johnson, 20 Texas, 396; Smith v. Boquet, 27 Texas, 507; Peters v. Clements, 46 Texas, 125.
We are further of opinion, that in submitting the statute of limitations the court should have qualified the charge by submitting in connection therewith appellant’s replication to the plea. That is to say, if the jury should have found that the property was the separate property of Mary M. Wynne, then they should have been instructed that the statute of limitations would not be a defense, if they should find that Mary M. Wynne continued to be the wife of Peter W. Wynne up-to and within less than five years before the filing of the suit. We call attention to this with a view to another trial.
Appellees in their brief seek to sustain the judgment on the ground that they were innocent purchasers. This defense was alleged by them in the trial court and proof offered in support of their pleas. The issue, however, was not submitted to the jury, and there is nothing in this record to show that the court refused to submit this issue to the jury. We do not, therefore, feel called upon to announce any conclusion upon it. As to whether appellees could avail themselves of this defense, under the facts disclosed by the record, we do not decide, as we would not be warranted in presuming that the court upon another trial would not properly pass upon this issue.
Delivered December 6, 1892.
On the grounds stated above, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.

219206,J. K. Bowden v. S. M. Crow,1893-03-02,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
In December, 1883, appellant sold to appellee 160 acres of land in Parker County, for which appellee agreed to pay $1400, paying $400 cash, and executing his two notes for $500 each, secured by vendor’s lien. Appellee, not having paid said notes in full, left the place on January 1, 1888, and appellant, with the consent of appellee, took possession of the same and held such possession during the years 1888 and 1889. In 1889 appellee returned and demanded possession of the place, and instituted suit of forcible entry and detainer to recover same. On the 21st of April, 1889, appellant and appellee filed in the County Court of said county an agreement under the statute to arbitrate the matters in controversy between them, a part of which agreement is as follows:
‘ ‘ Whereas, heretofore J. K. Bowden sold a certain farm in said county to S. M. Crow, containing 160 acres, vendor’s lien notes being executed by said Crow, and that as a substitute for said notes said Crow gave, on January 1, 1887, his note for §854, bearing interest from date; and whereas, J. K. Bowden, with the consent of S. M. Crow, went into possession of said farm January 1, 1888, and now holds the same; and whereas, said Crow has sued for possession; now, therefore, we hereby agree that the matters herein after mentioned shall be submitted to arbitration, to-wit:
“1. How much rent shall J. K. Bowden pay to S. M. Crow for the use of said land as rents from January 1, 1888, to date ?
“ 2. How much shall S. M. Crow pay J. K. Bowden for improvements made on said land since January 1, 1888 ?
“3. How much is due by S. M. Crow as principal and interest on said §854 note ?
“ 4. How much interest is due to S. M. Crow on rents on said lands held by J. It. Bowden for the years 1888 and 1889 ?”
It was also stipulated in the agreement for arbitration, that upon filing the report of the arbitrators with the county clerk the forcible entry and detainer case should be dismissed, and that Crow should save Bowden harmless on the §854 note, which had been deposited with the Corsicana Loan Agency as collateral security. W. R. McCreary was named as one of the arbitrators by Crow, and N. M. Dennis by Bowden. The two arbitrators thus selected, having heard the evidence and failing to agree, an umpire was named by the clerk in compliance with the statute, and the three thus selected again heard the evidence, and on July 18, 1890, filed the following award:
“S. M. Crow v. J. K. Bowden.—Matter of Arbitration. July 18,1890. The undersigned N. M. Dennis, one of the arbitrators chosen herein, and the undersigned Henry Ward, umpire selected by the clerk of the County Court of Parker County (the arbitrators, N. M. Dennis and W. R. Mc-Creary, having failed to agree), after hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, make the following award, the said W. R. McCreary, after full hearing by him, failing to agree with us, to-wit:
“ We find S. M. Crow is due J. K. Bowden:

“ Filed July 18, 1890.
“ B. W. Aicard,
“ County Clerk Parker County, Texas.”'
Appellee being dissatisfied with this award, on October 20, 1890, filed his amended petition, objecting to its being made the judgment of the court, charging in general terms that the arbitrators in making the same were actuated by gross partiality, fraud, and mistake, and also alleging that the items of $20 for hauling rock, and $150 and $60 for grubbing, did not come within the terms of the submission. He also contended that the first and fourth questions submitted to the arbitrators had been ignored by them.
Appellant filed general and special exceptions to the plea of appellee attacking this award. The special exception objected to the general terms in which the alleged fraud, partiality, and mistake were charged, and we are of opinion that this exception should have been sustained. It is well settled in this State, that where it is sought to set aside an award by arbitrators on the grounds above set forth, the facts constituting the objection to the award must be specifically averred; and in order to prevent the award from being made the judgment of the court in compliance with the agreement, it is necessary that the facts alleged be sufficient to vacate it when impeached in a court of equity. The principles governing such cases are so well settled by repeated decisions in this State, that it would be a useless consumption of time for us to undertake to review them. Payne v. Metz, 14 Texas, 56; Forshey v. Railway, 16 Texas, 532; McHugh v. Peck, 29 Texas, 150; Alexander v. Mulhall, 1 Posey’s U. C., 764.
We are also of opinion, that appellant’s assignment challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to set aside this award is well taken. We find no evidence whatever in the record to sustain the charge of fraud and partiality made against these arbitrators, and if any mistake was made by them, so far as this record discloses, it must be classed as a mistake of judgment and not of fact. The evidence introduced by the appellee in support of the charges made by him seems to relate almost entirely to the merits of the controversy between the parties, as though no award had been made,, and no attempt seems to have been made by him to show that these men had any prejudice against him or partiality for his adversary.
That the first and fourth items contained in the agreement for submission were not overlooked by the arbitrators, but that full evidence was heard thereon, is made clear by all the witnesses, including the arbitrator selected by appellee; and upon such hearing a majority of the arbitrators decided that appellee was not entitled to rent for the years 1888 and 1889, but in a spirit of liberality they decided to allow him credit for $140, interest that had been paid by appellant, in lieu of such rent. Certainly the allowance of this sum, when the arbitrators were of the opinion that appellee was entitled to nothing, furnishes no ground of complaint to him, unless their action in failing to allow him rent was erroneous, and as to whether or not such rent should have been allowed was decided by them against appellee after hearing the evidence, in which there was a sharp conflict.
We are also of opinion that the items of $20 for hauling rock, $150 for grubbing 15 acres of land at $10 per acre, and $60 for grubbing 30 acres of .shrubbed land, were properly considered by the arbitrators as coming within the meaning of improvements made on the land, as submitted by the second clause of the agreement. The $20 item was evidently for hauling rock to be used in building the chimneys; and while it might have been technically more correct for the arbitrators to have valued the chimneys at $50 after they were completed, instead of itemizing the cost at $20 for hauling the rock and $30 for putting it up, yet there was no substantial ground of complaint if they preferred the latter course.
We also believe that the cost of putting wild land in cultivation is generally classed under the head of improvements in actions of trespass to try title, and we see no good reason why the same rule should not apply in this case. Certainly it would not be equitable to require one, under the circumstances of this case, to expend more in putting timber land in cultivation than the value of the land itself, and receive no compensation therefor.
It seems that upon the trial of the case in the court below, the jury were impanelled and the evidence submitted upon the whole case, and the court first passed upon the issues as to whether or not the award of the arbitrators should be made the judgment of the court or should be set aside, and the issues upon the merits of the controversy were then submitted to the jury upon the evidence; and it must be conceded that, there is an expression in the syllabus to the case of Shulte v. Hoffman, 18, Texas, 678, which would indicate it to be the correct practice for the court to decide the issues of fact raised upon objections to receiving an award; but we are of opinion that the practice which should be adopted in such cases is that which obtains in an equitable proceeding to set aside a judgment subsequent to the term at which it was rendered.
The grounds for vacating an award by arbitrators are quite similar to those for setting aside a verdict of a jury or a judgment of a court; and in this class of cases the practice is now quite well settled to be, that when complaint is made of a verdict or judgment after the conclusion of the term, the complainant must set forth the facts of his case, as well as the grounds upon which he seeks to set aside the judgment, and the whole ease is decided by the jury under proper instructions from the court. If the jury find that the judgment should be set aside, they at the same time pass upon the merits of the case; but if they find that the judgment should not be vacated, they proceed no further. Taylor, Knapp & Co. v. Fore, 42 Texas, 256; Roller v. Wooldridge, 46 Texas, 485; Overton v. Blum, 50 Texas, 417; Raymond v. Conger, 51 Texas, 536; O'Neill v. Brown, 61 Texas, 34. We think the charges of fraud and partiality on the part of the arbitrators are questions which should be passed upon by the jury under appropriate instructions from the court, as well as the questions involving the merits of the controversy.
Appellant complains of the general way in which the court below submitted the issues to the jury on the merits of the case. We are of opinion that the charge of the court in such cases should be as full upon all the issues as in other cases tried before it, but if the court fails to give a proper charge the complaining party should request appropriate instructions.
Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial in accordance herewith.
Reversed and remanded.

216271,E. E. Chase v. The First National Bank of Cleburne,1892-12-06,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
On the first day of March, 1884, John L. Cleveland, then the owner of the land in controversy, executed to W. F. Sommerville a trust deed in the nature of a mortgage on said land, to-wit, a tract of 198 acres, situated in Johnson County, to secure George Halley and Alexander Gilroy in the payment of a certain promissory note for $1200, payable to their order in Fort Worth, Texas, with interest at 11 per cent per annum, payable semi-annually on the first days of March and September of each year, according to the terms of ten interest coupon notes thereto annexed; with the stipulation that if any one of said interest coupons should remain unpaid for five days after maturity, then, at the option of said Halley & Gilroy, or the holder of said promissory note, the whole principal, with interest then accrued, should at once become due and payable, and that the holder might proceed to collect the same by sale under the deed of trust.
It was further provided in the deed of trust, that in default of payment as aforesaid, said trustee was authorized, at the request of Halley & Gilroy, or other holder of the note, at any time made after default, to sell the property in controversy at private sale, or to the highest bidder for cash in hand or on credit, at the court house door in Tarrant County, Texas, at public outcry, within lawful hours, after giving public notice of the time, place, and terms of said public sale and of the property to be sold, either by publication in a newspaper or by posting a notice on the court house door of said county for twenty days prior to the sale. In negotiating the loan secured by the deed of trust, Sommerville acted as the agent of Halley & Gilroy, who resided beyond the seas. The deed of trust was promptly and duly recorded in Johnson County.
Thereafter, in May, 1884, Cleveland conveyed the land to W. D. Hudson, who, in July of the same year, conveyed it to B. F. Hudson for a recited consideration of $1000 cash and a purchase money note for $2500. This note afterwards became the property of appellee, the First National Bank of Cleburne, upon which, in 1887, it brought suit against B. F. Hudson to foreclose the vendor’s lien on the land. Upon this judgment an order of sale was issued, and on the first Tuesday in June, 1887, was executed by a sale of the land to the said bank. No deed was introduced in evidence conveying the property in controversy to the bank, nor was there any proof of the payment of its bid of $100 at the sheriff’s sale; but the return on the order of sale showed that that sum was bid by the bank, and that the property was struck off to it at said sale as the highest and best bidder.
On the first day of June, in the year 1887, prior to the sale under the order of sale, said Sommerville, by virtue of said deed of trust, sold the same property before the court house door of Tarrant County, within the hours prescribed by law, to the highest bidder for cash, after posting notices, as required in the deed of trust; at which sale appellant, E. E. Chase, became the purchaser at the sum of $1376, which was the amount of principal, interest, and costs due from said Cleveland. Of this sum only $133 was then paid in cash. There seems to have been an understanding between said Sommerville and Chase, as we infer from the evidence, though not admitted by them, that Sommerville, who was still the agent for Halley & Gilroy in loaning and collecting money for them, as such agent, would lend to Chase the balance of said bid, to be secured by a mortgage on the property, which was soon thereafter accomplished, a deed in pursuance of the sale under said trust deed having been duly executed to Chase upon his paying the $133 cash.
The sale under the deed of trust was not advertised and made until more than five days after the maturity and default in the payment of the interest coupon due March 1, 1887, which remained unpaid at the time of the sale. Prior to any steps taken on the part of Sommerville to sell under the deed of trust, his local agent in Johnson County, who had negotiated this loan, notified Cleveland and Hudson of the default, and that the land would be sold unless the interest was paid. Appellee had no knowledge or notice of the default or sale until afterward. Upon learning of the sale, appellee offered to pay to appellant the whole amount due upon the mortgage, including all sums paid out by appellant, and offered on the trial to do the same, which offers appellant declined. The property was shown to be worth from $2500 to $3000.
The original note executed by Cleveland, which was secured by the deed of trust, was not payable until five years after its date; and likewise the subsequent note executed by Chase, secured by his deed of trust on the land, had five years to run. Appellant took possession of the land under his purchase at the trustee’s sale, and thereafter appellee brought this suit in trespass to try title, setting up in its petition irregularities and fraud in the sale under the deed of trust, praying to have it set aside and to be permitted to redeem the land from the original mortgagee; appellant pleading not guilty.
The case was submitted to the jury on the alleged irregularities in the sale, the proof being properly deemed insufficient by the trial court to warrant the submission of the issue of fraud. The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee for the land and for $200 rents, and for appellant $1200 (owing to Halley & Gilroy) with interest, $291.35; also $176 paid Sommerville, amounting, with interest, to $211.49; total, $1702.84. This verdict was approved and judgment entered in favor of appellee for the land, subject to the mortgage executed by appellant to Halley & Gilroy for $1200; also decreeing that appellant recover of appellee the sum of $302.84 with 8 per cent interest per annum, to be paid by appellee upon taking possession of the land.
From this judgment E. E. Chase appeals.
We have reached the conclusion, after a careful consideration of the facts contained in the record, that the trustee’s sale under which appellant deraigns title was not attended with such irregularity as would warrant its being set aside, even in a direct proceeding for that purpose, with all parties at interest before the court.
The charge of the court, of which complaint is made, must have conveyed to the minds of the jury the impression that some sort of declaration on the part of Halley & Gilroy of their option to treat the principal debt as due upon default in the pa)rment of the interest was necessary before their agent and trustee, Sommerville, could proceed to sell under the deed of trust. We are of opinion that no such declaration was essential to the exercise of such power. Leonard v. Tyler, 60 Cal., 299; Harper v. Ely, 56 Ill., 179.
According to our construction of the deed of trust and of the law, Sommerville, as the agent of Halley & Gilroy, had the power, upon default in payment of the interest, to exercise for his principals, and did in this case exercise for them, this right of electing to treat the principal debt as due; and by proceeding to advertise and sell the property this purpose was manifested.
The charge also, in effect, instructed the jury, that if at the public sale; which was advertised and made ostensibly as a cash sale, there was a private understanding between Sommerville and Chase that only a part of the bid of the latter was to be paid cash, and that the balance was to be carried by Halley & Gilroy as a loan, the amount of the bid to cover the entire debt with interest and costs, this would render the trustee’s sale invalid. This charge is also complained of, and we are of opinion that it contains error. Our view is,, that where a trust deed authorizes a sale for cash, and the trustee, who is also the mortgagee or the agent of the mortgagee, purporting to sell for cash, gives credit, or has an understanding with the bidder that credit will be given him on part of his bid, in order to induce him to make the property bring the full amount of the debt secured, this is not to the injury of the mortgagor or those claiming under him, and will not avoid the sale. Marsh v. Hubbard, 50 Texas, 203; Ballinger v. Bourland, 87 Ill., 513; Burr v. Borden, 61 Ill., 391. No other alleged irregularities were or should have been submitted to the jury; and our conclusion is, that those submitted, if irregularities at all, were not such as appellee could justly complain of. We are further of opinion, that if there had been any such irregularities as would avoid the sale in a direct proceeding, without Halley & Gilroy before the court, appellee could not obtain that relief. «
Delivered December 6, 1892.
In order to set aside a sale in a direct proceeding for that purpose, the purchaser at such sale must be placed in statu quo. We can not perceive how, under the peculiar facts of this case, this could be done without Halley & Gilroy before the court. Certain it is that it was not done by the judgment rendered. Appellant has the return of his money with 8 per cent interest adjudged to him, but he is not released and could not be released, without Halley & Gilroy before the court, from his obligation to pay them 81200, which would certainly make him liable for whatever should remain unpaid upon the sale of the property under the mortgage executed by him, should appellee fail to redeem the land from the mortgage.
Whether appellee, in the absence of a deed from the sheriff, without showing the payment of its bid, or showing that a credit of the amount thereof was entered on its judgment, could maintain this suit may be doubted, but as it is unnecessary in this case to pass upon that issue we leave it undetermined.
Our conclusion is, that the court should have instructed the jury to return a verdict for appellant, and therefore that the judgment should be reversed and here rendered for appellant for the land in controversy.
Reversed and rendered.
A motion for rehearing in this case was overruled"
219200,S. B. Burnett et al. v. E. Friedenhaus,1893-03-02,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This action was brought by appellee to recover 177 acres of land situated in Wichita County. The land was located many years ago by virtue of an unlocated balance of the head-right certificate issued to Gadi West, but no patent ever issued. Appellee deraigned title by mesne conveyance from West. The matter in controversy was the genuineness of the conveyance from West to one William C. Boone, which bears date July 5,1838, and was acknowledged July 25, 1852. This issue was submitted to the jury, and our conclusion is, that their finding in favor of its genuineness is supported by the evidence. It is undisputed that appellee had whatever title Boone acquired by that conveyance.
Appellant’s first assignment of error complains of the charge of the court in submitting to the jury the question, whether this purported transfer of the certificate from West to Boone was executed by authority of West, because the evidence did not raise this issue; the contention being that the charge should have confined the inquiry to the question, whether West executed it, without also submitting whether it was done by his authority. There was testimony offered by appellants to the effect that West could neither read nor write. The issue was therefore raised, whether his name had been signed to the conveyance with or without his consent. It seems clear to us that this assignment is not well taken.
The second assignment complains that there was error in allowing this conveyance to be read to the jury over the several objections made thereto by the defendants, as shown by their bill of exceptions number 1. No propositions or statements are submitted under this assignment, nor are we in any way informed by the briefs what these objections were. It appears therefrom that there were several of them. This assignment is therefore manifestly bad.
The fourth assignment complains of the refusal of the court to give special instructions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Appellee objects to our considering the propositions submitted under this assignment, because it is not sufficiently specific. Under the well settled rules of practice, therefore, we are precluded from considering these propositions.
The fifth and last assignment copied in the brief contains a series of objections to the verdict of the jury. We are of opinion that upon every issue raised in the case the verdict of the jury is supported by the evidence.
It follows from these conclusions that the judgment must be affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered March 2, 1893."
219128,The Fort Worth & Denver City Railway Company v. C. W. Ward et al.,1893-03-02,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This suit was brought for damages resulting to appellees from overcrowding their cattle in cars furnished by appellant for shipment from Harrold, Texas, to Chicago, Illinois, as well as for the loss of some that escaped in loading. One Chatham, as agent for appellees, accompanied the cattle shipped as aforesaid, and testified as to the injuries received by the cattle; and that he was acquainted with the market value of said cattle at Chicago when delivered; and that he had been engaged in the business of handling and shipping cattle for several years, and knew the condition of said cattle at the time they were shipped and at the time they arrived at Chicago. Whereupon appellees requested him to state what the damage per head to said cattle was on arrival at Chicago; to which appellant objected, on the ground that the question called for a conclusion of the witness; which objection being overruled, the following answer was made: “ In my opinion all said cattle were damaged §5 per head.” Appellant having reserved a bill of exceptions to the introduction of this testimony, assigns its admission as error.
This question was passed upon by us in the case of Railway v. Wright, 1 Texas Civil Appeals, 402. On the authority of that case and the cases therein cited, we must hold this assignment to be well taken.
The other assignments contained in appellant’s brief, to-wit, the fourth, fifth, seventh, and eighth, are believed to be without merit.
As the illegal testimony was of a material character, and we can not say that it did not influence the verdict of the jury, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered March 2, 1893."
219184,Jot Gunter v. John Armstrong et al.,1893-03-02,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
It is recited in the statement of facts, that a judgment was rendered November 8, 1887, by the District Court for Grayson County, Texas, in a suit in said court of N. & J. Baxter against the heirs of Montgomery Baxter, deceased, by which the land in controversy was set apart in partition to the heirs of Lucy Armstrong, and authorized the issuance of execution in favor of the officers of court against each party for his proportion of the costs of the-suit, according to the amount of land received by each; said judgment showing upon its face that the defendants in said suits were cited by publication, and nowhere showing that they had appeared and answered either in person or by attorney.”
It was admitted that both parties claimed title under the heirs of Lucy Armstrong as a common source. We are not informed by the record whether, at the time of the rendition of the judgment above referred to, the heirs of Lucy Armstrong were citizens of this State and their residence unknown, or whether they were nonresidents. Appellant claims the land in controversy under a sale by virtue of an execution issued upon this judgment in favor of 1 ‘ The Officers of Court v. The Heirs of Lucy Armstrong ’ ’ for their part of the costs incurred in that case. Appellees claim as the heirs of Lucy Armstrong, and as such recovered in the court below; and by reason of the condition of the record as above indicated, they have appeared in this court and confessed error in the judgment, and ask that the cause be remanded to enable them to produce evidence to show that by the record in the case in which that judgment was rendered it appears that the heirs of Lucy Armstrong were at that time citizens of the State of Missouri. Appellant objects to our remanding the cause, and insists that such judgment should be here rendered as should have been rendered by the court below.
That a judgment for costs in a proceeding of this kind is in personam, and can not be sustained upon service by publication where the defendants are nonresidents, is settled by the decisions in this State. Foote v. Sewall, 81 Texas, 659. It seems also to be settled in this State, that unless it be made to affirmatively appear that the defendants in a suit by publication are nonresidents at the time of such service, this will not be presumed; but on the contrary, it will be presumed that they were citizens of this State, and the judgment valid. Martin v. Burns, 80 Texas, 676, and authorities there cited. We are therefore of opinion that the court below probably erred in holding the judgment upon its face to be a nullity; but inasmuch as the court did so hold, we think the proper practice, as indicated by the decisions of our Supreme Court, will be to remand the cause to enable the parties to show the real facts, instead of for us to undertake to here render such judgment as we would be required to render, taking the record as disclosing all of the evidence that could be produced by the parties.
In the case of Rust v. Burke, Turner & Co., 57 Texas, 341, one of the parties was undertaking to plead in setoff a judgment in his favor against the other, which seems to have been disallowed upon the ground that an appeal had been taken from the judgment. In passing upon the question of practice in such cases, Associate Justice Stay ton, delivering the opinion of the court, says: “The record shows that notice of appeal was given in the case of Taylor v. George & Zorn, but does not show that an appeal was ever perfected. This fact can not be presumed, and it must be held to be a subsisting judgment until the contrary is shown. The judgment offered in evidence by Rust in setoff amounted to more than the note sued upon, and judgment should have been rendered in favor of appellant, and ordinarily judgment in such case would be here rendered as the court below should have done; but as it appears that notice of appeal was given in the case of Taylor v. George & Zorn, the judgment will therefore be reversed and the cause remanded that appellees may have an opportunity to show, if they can, that that judgment has been set aside.”
In McConnell v. Wall, 67 Texas, 352, it seems that the case had been before the court at a former term, and was reversed and remanded, with instructions to the court below to ascertain only one fact, and then enter a judgment in accordance with the opinion then rendered. It was admitted in the court below that this fact was such as to entitle the appellee to a judgment under the opinion, but appellant insisted upon opening the whole case and having a trial by a jury, which was refused; and Justice Stay ton, in delivering the opinion, says: “The court below did not misunderstand the former judgment of this court, and correctly refused to reopen the entire case. If the appellant was of the opinion when the judgment of this court was entered at the last term that on another trial lie could make proof that would show Ms right to be other than by the record it then appeared, he should have asked this court so to reform its judgment as to give him an opportunity to do so. This he did not do.”
In this case appellees make such request. Also see a similar practice indicated in the case of the Merchants and Planters Bank v. Thomas & Sons, 69 Texas, 237, and in Clark v. Cummings, 84 Texas, 610.
The statute governing the practice in this court in such cases is the ■same as that heretofore regulating the practice in the Supreme Court, and is as follows: “ When the judgment or decree of the court below shall be reversed, the court shall proceed to render such judgment or decree as the court below should have rendered, except when it is necessary that some matter of fact be ascertained, or the damage to be assessed or the matter to be decreed is uncertain, in either of which cases the cause shall be remanded for a new trial in the court below.”
It will be observed, that the defect in this record is in its failure to ascertain whether the heirs of Lucy Armstrong were residents or nonresidents of this State at the time of the service by publication upon them. If this fact had been ascertained in the court below and properly appeared in the record, our duty would be to affirm or reverse and render the judgment, as the facts of the case might require; but not having been ascertained, we think this should be done before the court attempts to render a judgment final upon the rights of the parties. We believe such to be the practice adopted by our Supreme Court under a similar statute, and that it will more conduce to attaining the ends of justice than a harsher rule.
We are more inclined to adopt this course in this case from the fact that we entertain serious doubts as to whether or not this judgment should be reversed at all upon the record as presented to us. It will be seen, that the judgment, as appears from the record, seems to have been against the heirs of Lucy Armstrong, not against her unknown heirs. We have a statute recognizing such proceedings against unknown heirs, but none against heirs as such, whose names are known but not given. The court below found against the validity of this judgment; and to sustain its finding, might we not be required to presume that this judgm'ent, when introduced in evidence in the court below, did not appear to have been rendered in a proceeding under the statute above indicated, and was therefore unauthorized? The execution issued upon this judgment also seems to have been against the heirs of Lucy Armstrong, and not against her unknown heirs; and we are not now prepared to hold, that if we were required to pass upon the record as presented to us, we would be called upon to overrule the court below in refusing to sustain a sale under these proceedings. But these questions not having been presented by counsel, we render no decision thereon, and only allude to them in support of our action in remanding the cause to enable both parties to present the case to the court below upon a fuller statement of the facts as they exist.
In justice to the learned judge who presided at the trial in the court below, we will add, that as appears from an affidavit on file, he was of the impression that the pleadings in the case in which the judgment in question was rendered were considered in evidence, and that these disclosed the nonresidence of the defendants therein.
The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered March 2, 1893."
216298,Franco-Texan Land Company v. A. B. Simpson,1892-12-13,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This suit was brought in the District Court of Parker County by appellant, against appellee, to recover the sum of $90.27, amount of a promissory note, with interest, and to foreclose the vendor’s lien on certain land described in the petition. The defendant relied as a special defense upon a partial failure of consideration arising out of the deficiency in the quantity of land. The court tried the case without a jury and rendered judgment for the defendant; hence this appeal.
1. November 18,1881, the Franco-Texan Land Company by deed conveyed to defendant the land on which foreclosure is sought.
2. This deed by metes and bounds sets out the land conveyed, and concludes the description therein with the recital that the land contains “ 102.59 acres, more or less, being the southwest fractional part of survey No. 327.” The instrument recites a consideration of $82.07 cash, the balance secured in six promissory notes, the last of which is the one here involved. It expressly retains the vendor’s lien, and provides that the deed shall become absolute as a conveyance on payment of all the notes.
3. The land conveyed is out of a larger tract owned by appellant, through patent from the State, recorded February 20, 1878. The patent describes the entire tract as containing 511.79 acres. The tract, however, does not contain this quantity, because the calls for distance are required to yield to the calls in the patent for marked lines and corners.
4. At the time of the purchase the plaintiff, vendor, represented to the defendant that there were 102.59 acres in the tract conveyed. The defendant relied upon these representations, and so purchased the land. There was no actual fraud on the part of the vendor, both the vendor and vendee believing at the time that the tract contained the quantity named.
5. There were, however, only 85 acres embraced in the tract conveyed. The deficiency is caused by the calls for distance being controlled by calls for lines and corners marked and established.
6. The sale was a sale by the acre — that is to say, that in arriving at the price the parties estimated the tract to contain 102.59 acres — and the price agreed upon was $4 per acre.
7. Soon after the purchase the defendant moved on the land and has ever since resided thereon, undisturbed in his title or possession of the land actually conveyed to him. He did not, however, discover the deficiency until after he had paid the purchase money notes, except the last, which is here sued upon.
8. The deficiency in the land, 17.59 acres, at $4 per acre, exceeds the amount of the note involved, with interest.
We do not concur with appellant in its first contention, that the answer of defendant is subject to general demurrer. The answer, in effect, alleges that the land was sold by the acre; that the plaintiff falsely represented that there were 102.59 acres in the tract; that defendant relied on these false representations, and was by them induced to purchase; that there was a shortage of 17.59 acres, which defendant did not discover until after the payment of the fifth note; that plaintiff knew of the discrepancy at the time of the sale to defendant. The answer prayed an abatement of the price to the extent of the value of the deficiency.
We believe the correct doctrine to be, that where land is sold by the acre, and the parties are under a mutual mistake as to the quantity conveyed, or where the vendee is moved to the purchase by the false representations of the vendor, even though innocently made, and the deficiency is afterwards discovered, equity will grant to the vendee a proportionate abatement of the purchase price. The vendee may seek this relief under a plea of partial failure of consideration, setting up the mistake or the false representations. Mitchell v. Zimmerman, 4 Texas, 75; Walling v. Kennard, 10 Texas, 508; Moore v. Hazelwood, 67 Texas, 626; Wheeler v. Boyd, 69 Texas, 298.
This rule does not obtain in the absence of actual fraud, when the sale is in gross; and it would seem that the deed unexplained and for a designated number of acres “ more or less,” would, if its execution and delivery be unaccompanied by an understanding to the contrary, indicate a sale in gross, and not by the acre. Bellamy v. McCarthy, 75 Texas, 294. It does not follow, however, that the vendee in the deed containing the recital “ more or less” will thereby be precluded, under allegations of fraud or mistake, from pleading and proving an agreement contemporaneous with the execution of the deed, making the transaction a sale by the acre and not in gross. In this case, under the allegations of the answer, the defendant was the victim of misrepresentation; the quantity of land sold was of the “ essence of the contract,” and “ the deficiency is so great as to have been material.” Equity under such circumstances will grant relief, although the land is described in the deed as so many acres, “ more or less.” Smith v. Fly, 24 Texas, 351.
Delivered December 13, 1892.
It follows, from the views above expressed, that we also differ from appellant in its succeeding contention, that the court erred in admitting the parol testimony of the defendant to show the transaction to have been a sale by the acre and not in gross. Under the allegations of the answer, showing fraud or mistake, this testimony was admissible, not so much for the purpose of contradicting the deed as for the purpose, with reference to the entire transaction, of indicating the proper interpretation of the expression “ more or less ” contained in the deed. Smith v. Fly, 24 Texas, 351; Weir v. McGee, 25 Texas Supp., 31.
We think there was ample evidence to sustain the finding of fact and to justify the conclusion of law by the court that the transaction was a sale by the acre and not in gross.
The judgment is therefore affirmed.
Affirmed.
Justice Stephens did not sit in this case."
216276,W. C. Howard & Co. v. O. F. Parks,1892-12-13,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
This is a suit, under the statute, for the trial of the right of property in certain machinery and live stock, which were owned by. one W. F. Bachman and transferred by him to O. F. Parks. A short time after this transfer, appellants W. C. Howard & Co. sued out a writ of attachment against Bachman and had the same levied upon the property transferred to Parks as aforesaid. . Parks filed his claimant’s bond as required by law, with I. L. Dunn and C. A. Arnold as sureties, which bond was dated April 14, 1885.
In the issues between the parties in the suit for the trial of the right of property arises the question as to whether or not the transfer from Bachman to Parks was in fraud of the creditors of the former. It seems that Bachman and Parks were in partnership, and Parks claimed that a large amount of money he had furnished to be used in the partnership business had been fraudulently appropriated by Bachman to his own use and to the payment of his individual debts, without having been applied to the partnership business, and that when he learned this he had a settlement with said Bachman, in which the latter was found to be indebted to him for the money so misapplied in the sum of $5400, and the transfer of the property in controversy was made in consideration of a credit upon this indebtedness to an amount more than the full value thereof. Appellant’ s contention was, that the transfer from Bachman to Parks was only colorable, to enable the latter to hold the property from creditors of the former, who at that time was alleged to be insolvent, and that the pretended consideration from Parks to Bachman was much less than the value of the property; also, that the pretended transfer from Bachman to Parks was fictitious and fraudulent, and if any indebtedness existed at all it could only be ascertained by a settlement of the partnership business, which had not been had. The evidence upon the issue of fraud thus raised was very conflicting, and a verdict for either party thereon would be well sustained.
In September, after the transfer from Bachman to Parks in April, the latter instituted suit to recover of the former the $5400 indebtedness alleged to be due him as above set forth, and in this suit he gave Bachman credit for the consideration he was to pay for the property in controversy under the transfer thereof to him; and on the trial of the suit between appellants and appellee for the trial of the right of property, Parks was permitted, over the objection of appellants, to introduce in evidence his own petition in his suit against Bachman above set forth, with a lengthy exhibit thereto attached, showing the state of accounts between them, and the recital of a credit given to Parks for this property upon said account, for the purpose of rebutting the charge of collusion, alleged by appellants to exist between Parks and Bachman, resulting in such transfer. The explanation made by the court below for admitting this evidence is endorsed on the bill of exceptions as follows: “Approved, with the explanation that the same [referring to the petition and exhibits aforesaid]' were offered to rebut the presumption of collusion charged to exist between defendant and Bachman, and was supplemented by the evidence of D. T. Bledsoe, a reputable lawyer, to the effect that Bachman was represented by him, and that the issues in said case were contested by him, and also to show that defendant had credited his demand with $2000, the amount of his several purchases.”
That the admission of this evidence was error we think perfectly clear from the reasons given by the learned judge for its admission. We do not understand how, as against appellants, defendant could rebut this charge of collusion by any statement he might make in the petition filed by him against Bachman, and in which appellants were in nowise parties; and especially could this not be done after appellants had attached this property and appellee had filed his claim bond, and the issue of fraud and collusion was thus being litigated. The evidence was clearly inadmissible and will necessitate a reversal of the case.
In their second amended tender of issues, appellants alleged that the indebtedness from Bachman to them was evidenced by twelve certain promissory notes for $100 each, in each of which a lien was reserved upon part of the machinery in controversy to secure its payment, and that these notes were merged into a judgment rendered in the suit in which the attachment under which the levy in this case was made was issued; they also alleged the insolvency of Bachman, and prayed that the issue thus raised as to the validity of this lien be litigated in this proceeding and foreclosed, and if the court found it necessary, that Bachman be made a party for this purpose.
Appellee filed a special exception to this part of appellants’ issues, to the effect that this alleged lien could not be litigated in this proceeding, and the court sustained this exception; and a majority of the court are of opinion that this was error, believing that under the peculiar facts of this case appellants should have been permitted to foreclose their lien, if valid, on-that portion of the property in controversy upon which it might have been shown to exist. As they had already obtained a judgment against Bachman, who was alleged to be insolvent, for the debt secured by the lien, which judgment they think may be inferred from the pleading to be still in force and not dormant, and as Bachman had conveyed all his interest in the property to Parks, they do not believe it necessary for him to be made a party to the suit for foreclosure; and as the parties, therefore, were all before the court and the property in the custody of the law, under Revised Statutes, article 4823, they do not believe there is any feature in the very speedy and informal method of procedure provided by our statute for forming and trying the issue as to the right of property which would preclude the foreclosure of a lien on the same property in the same suit between substantially the same parties, especially as that statute provides that the practice under it shall be as nearly as practicable the same as in other cases. Rev. Stats., art. 4837. They think that while under the present statute the claimant’s bond secures the cost of the suit, this was not formerly so, and the judgment to be entered for costs on such bond is not peculiar to this remedy. Rev. Stats., art. 4843; 49 Texas, 170; 80 Texas, 233. In their view, while it maybe that it would be simpler and better not to allow the joinder, yet they think that this objection would lie to our whole system, which seeks to settle as far as possible controversies between the same parties in one suit. For an intimation that a joinder in such cases would be proper, see Dupuy v. Ullman, Lewis & Co., 78 Texas, 341.
The writer, however, can not agree with this view of the law as being applicable to this proceeding. In their tender of issues, which was filed May 27, 1889, appellants allege that the judgment in their favor against Bachman was rendered on the 7th day of March, 1887, and it will thus be seen that more than two years elapsed between these dates, and there is no allegation that execution had been issued so as to prevent the judgment from being dormant at the date this foreclosure was sought. If this judgment was dormant, it is settled that Bachman would be a necessary party to obtain this foreclosure (Slaughter v. Owens, 60 Texas, 668), and the writer is not prepared to say that he would not be a necessary party even though the judgment be in full force. It would seem, under our statute, that the amount due upon this judgment at the time of foreclosure would have to be ascertained (Revised Statutes, article 1340), and to do this Bachman would at least be a proper party. He should be allowed to show what part, if any, of this judgment had been paid since its rendition. An examination of the different cases in which suits have been brought in this State to foreclose liens after the rendition of judgment for the debt to pay which the lien is foreclosed, seems to disclose the fact that the debtor in the judgment has invariably been made a party to the foreclosure suit; but there are intimations m the opinion delivered in the case in 60 Texas, cited above, which would indicate that this might not be necessary in case the judgment was not dormant.
Proceeding, however, upon the idea that appellants’ issues will be so amended as to show that their judgment against Bachman is still in force, and conceding that for this reason it will not be necessary that he be made a party to this proceeding, the writer does not believe that even in such case it would be proper practice to allow the joinder of these two distinct causes of action herein. Ordinarily a lien is foreclosed by filing a petition, which is answered in the usual way, but in this case it is sought to be foreclosed by a tender of issues in a statutory proceeding seemingly authorized for the sole purpose of determining as to whether or not the property levied on is subject to the writ. It must be admitted, however, that our courts have gone to great lengths in the line indicated by the views entertained by the majority of the court, and many causes of action have been permitted tobe joined-that under the practice obtaining in the tribunals of other States would not be allowed; but even in this State the practice is not without its limits, and the writer is aware of no case where a special proceeding, such as this, has been joined with a suit that ordinarily could be prosecuted only under the forms prescribed for cases generally, and he believes that no good purpose can be subserved by attempting to engraft on our already liberal practice an additional feature of this kind.
It will be borne in mind that appellants do not claim to have a lien upon all of the property in controversy, but only upon some of the machinery. As a basis for this proceeding appellee was required to give bond for the trial of the right to this property, conditioned as required by our statute; and if he should fail to maintain his claim, his securities would be required to pay the costs of this proceeding. So far, then, as the trial of the question of the liability of this property to appellants’ attachment is involved, the securities on appellee’s claim bond are parties to this proceeding, and liable to have judgment rendered against them, from which they could prosecute an appeal; and the writer believes that this being a statutory proceeding, the liability of these securities should be measured strictly by the terms of their bond, and that they should not be forced into a litigation involving other issues than those properly raised in deciding their liability.
If the joinder of this separate and distinct cause of action is to be permitted, and plaintiffs should be successful upon one or both issues, and appellee or his securities desire to appeal from the judgment rendered, would both cases go up on such appeal, or only the one of which they desired to complain ? How would the appeal bond be payable and conditioned ? How would the cost of the two proceedings be adjusted ? If appellants should succeed in holding the property subject both to their attachment and contract liens in the same judgment, and the securities on the claim bond should appeal by giving a supersedeas bond, what would be their liability thereon, in case the judgment should be affirmed, for having thus delayed the foreclosure proceedings ? The securities on the claimant’s bond, it is believed, should not be held responsible for any part of the costs incurred in litigating over the contract lien, and the adjustment of these complicated issues, it seems to the writer, would suggest the better practice to be to keep the suits separate. Certainly this is the view that has heretofore been entertained by the profession.
Commencing in 12 Texas, mortgagees out of possession attempted to maintain this statutory proceeding for the trial of the right of property, and since that time numerous cases have arisen in which the plaintiffs therein occupied the same position in reference to the property claimed as appellants in this case, but it seems that none of them understood that they would have the right to foreclose their respective mortgages in case they failed to maintain their right to the property itself.
The majority of the court, however, as indicated above, are of the opinion that the rights of the different parties can be sufficiently protected in the judgment that is rendered, and that it will be more in harmony with our system of practice to allow, upon proper pleading, all claims in reference to any of the property in controversy to be settled in this proceeding, without driving the parties to the necessity of instituting a separate suit, and the action of the court below in not permitting this to be done will be held to be error.
Some of the more recent cases illustrating the practice in our courts in reference to the joinder and misjoinder of causes of action are as follows: Stewart v. Gordon, 65 Texas, 344; Bank v. Emery, 78 Texas, 498; Callahan v. Houston, 78 Texas, 494; Construction Co. v. Meddlegge, 75 Texas, 634.
Delivered December 13, 1892.
There are quite a number of other assignments of error, but we believe no useful purpose could be subserved in their discussion, as the questions suggested therein are not likely to arise upon another trial. We will add, however, that the practice of submitting cases upon special issues is not only recognized as being proper by our decisions, but is also left to the discretion of the trial judge by our statute. 1 Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 1333.
We will also add, that we are of opinion that if appellants had a contract lien, as alleged, upon a part of the machinery in controversy, this lien was not waived by suing out an attachment upon the debt secured by such lien. We see no such inconsistency in the two suits as that the suing out of the attachment should have this effect. Allyn & Co. v. Willis & Bro., 65 Texas, 72; Byram v. Stout, 127 Ind., 195. Since Mc-Alpin v. Burnett, 19 Texas, 497, it has been repeatedly held in this State, that suing upon a note secured by a lien without having the lien foreclosed is not a waiver of such lien. Slaughter v. Owens, 60 Texas, 668. The authorities referred to in Jones on Chattel Mortgages, section 565, intimating a different view, are reviewed in Byram v. Stout, 127 Indiana, above cited. In this State a mortgage only has the effect of a lien on the property, as in Indiana.
For the errors above indicated, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded."
219179,"Western Union Telegraph Company and Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. G. L. Phillips",1893-03-09,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
Upon the trial below the court instructed the jury, “ that the sixty days within which to make demand by appellant for his damages would not begin to run against him until the message was delivered to him, or from the date when for the first time he learned, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence could have learned, that such message had been sent to him;” and the telegraph company complains in its ninth assignment at the giving of this charge.
We believe this charge of the court was erroneous. We do not, however, think that this limitation must in all cases date from the sending of the message; but where knowledge of the sending of the message is received by the plaintiff long enough before the expiration of the sixty days after it was sent to enable him, with reasonable diligence, to make claim for damages as called for in the contract, he would be required to do so within that time; and where the evidence makes it doubtful as to whether or not such reasonable time remained after such message was forwarded to enable this to be done, the question should be submitted to the jury under appropriate instruction.
In several cases where there was no conflict in the evidence, the courts of this State have held such stipulations in contracts of this kind to be reasonable, as a question of law (Telegraph Company v. Culberson, 79 Texas, 65; Lester v. Telegraph Company, 84 Texas, 313); but we do not understand any of these cases to hold, that where a part or all of the time called for in the contract has expired before the injured party acquires knowledge of the fact that the telegram had been sent him, that the jury would not be authorized to find such stipulation to be unreasonable as applied to the facts of that particular case.
District Judge Spear, in a well reasoned opinion in the case of Johnson v. Western Union Telegraph Company, 33 Federal Reporter, 362, states the case of a plaintiff who is a farmer residing six miles in the country, and has business engagements important to him, but unimportant to his correspondent, in Omaha; he leaves his address at the telegraph office, and calls repeatedly for his telegram; is informed there is nothing for him; the telegraph company wires the Omaha firm that there is no such man as the plaintiff; they drop the matter; not receiving his telegram, he drops it; after the expiration of the time he discovers the injury done him; and under such circumstances holds, that this stipulation as to time in which the claim for damages should be presented would be unreasonable, and with this reasoning we concur. See Thomp. on Electricity, sec. 294.
It has, however, been held by the St. Louis Court of Appeals, that where the whole time has not elapsed before knowledge is received, that it then becomes a question as to whether or not, under all the circumstances, sufficient time remains. Tliomp. on Law of Electricity, secs. 250, 255. This decision seems to us also to be sound.
In a number of cases in this State it has been held, that the reasonableness of similar provisions in a contract of this kind with a common carrier for the shipment of live stock is a question for the decision of the jury under the circumstances of the particular case. Railway v. Childers, 1 Texas Civ. App., 302.
Where the time in which the claim for damage is to be presented is fixed by the contract, the court might well decide it to be reasonable, as in the cases referred to above; but where the injured party has been deprived of a portion of the time he should have had under his contract in which to make his claim, and the evidence raises the question as to whether or not the time that remained was reasonably sufficient to enable him to present his claim within the time called for therein, we think the issue should be submitted to the jury under appropriate instructions, to decide whether the contract was reasonable as applied to the facts of that particular case. For this error in the charge, the judgment of the court below must be reversed as to the Western Union Telegraph Company; and we believe no useful purpose could be subserved by a discussion of the other errors assigned by it, as they are not of a nature that will likely arise upon another trial.
The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Eailway Company complains, (1) that inasmuch as it received the telegram at Purcell, in the .Chickasaw Nation, to be transmitted to Ardmore in the same Nation, the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts for the United States for the Northern District of Texas, the Western District of Arkansas, and the District of Kansas, alone have jurisdiction of this case as to it. The act of Congress relied upon to sustain this contention is as follows: “ That the United States Circuit and District Courts for the Northern District of Texas, the Western District of Arkansas, and the District of Kansas, and such other courts as may be authorized by Congress, shall have, without reference to the amount in controversy, concurrent jurisdiction, over all controversies arising between said Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Eailway Company and the nations and tribes through whose territory said railway shall be constructed. Said courts shall have like jurisdiction, without reference to the amount in controversy, over all controversies arising between the inhabitants of said nations or tribes and said railway company; and the civil jurisdiction of said courts is hereby extended within the limits of said Indian Territory, without distinction as to citizenship of the parties, so far as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this act.” Without considering the validity of this act of Congress in any of its features, we are of opinion that there is nothing therein which seeks to give exclusive jurisdiction to any of said courts, or to deprive any other court of any jurisdiction which it would otherwise have. It only gives concurrent jurisdiction to the courts therein named.
Appellant also contends, that the courts of this State have the right to refuse to entertain jurisdiction of cases of this kind, and that upon principles of sound policy they should exercise this right. To support this view, the case of Morris v. Railway, 78 Texas, 17, is strenuously relied upon. In that case it will be noted that both parties were nonresidents of this State. In this case the appellant is a Texas corporation, and we see no good reason why the courts of this State should refuse relief even to a nonresident against it in a meritorious case; but in this case it is by no means clear that appellee has lost his citizenship in this State. It is true, he is residing in the Indian Territory, but lie went from this State, and he does not seem to have become a member of any of the Indian tribes by marriage, as in the Morris case. In the Morris case, the court below refused to entertain jurisdiction, and our Supreme Court sustained it in such refusal. In this case the court below assumed jurisdiction, and we see no good reason to question the validity of its judgment on account thereof. Should a citizen of some other State or country seek to hold the Western Union Telegraph Company (it not being a Texas corporation) in our courts upon a cause of action of this kind arising outside of this State, the Morris case would go far toward holding that the proper course would be for our courts to refuse to entertain jurisdiction of such case.
The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company presents the proposition, “ that unless the cause of action is recognized by the State or country where the wrongful act or omission occurred, no cause of action can be maintained thereon in this State, for in such case no cause of action exists;” and contends, that because the courts of the Chickasaw Nation can afford no redress in cases of this kind, appellee has no remedy anywhere.. Appellee’s right of action arose as well out of the contract made by said appellant to transmit and deliver said message, as it did out of the obligation incumbent upon it in the performance of its duties to the public, on receipt of the message, to transmit and deliver it with dispatch. We do not understand from the statement of facts that contracts of this kind are illegal in the Chickasaw Nation, in the sense of being prohibited by its laws; but the evidence only goes to the extent of showing that its courts have not been authorized to afford a remedy in such cases. If we should hold this contract illegal according to the laws of that Nation, we would, upon the same evidence, be required to hold all contracts made therein for the payment of money or the performance of obligations, except in a few specified cases, illegal. We believe that this has never been regarded as the law applicable to ordinary contracts made in that country, and we would not feel authorized in so holding, except upon the clearest convictions of its correctness.
In 2 Kent’s Commentaries, 13 ed., 462, it is said: “Remedies upon contracts and their incidents are regulated and pursued according to the law of the place where the action is instituted, and the lex loci has no application. The lex loci acts upon the right; the lex fori on the remedy.” This we understand to be the generally accepted doctrine. If then it be conceded that the laws of the Chickasaw Nation have application to others than its citizens, can it be said that the mere failure of their courts to be authorized to afford a remedy in such cases will deprive the injured party, in case of violation of a contract made therein, of all remedy everywhere ? We believe not, and that in such cases the injured party can enforce his rights according to the remedies provided by the country where the defendant may be found.
But if we treat this case as sounding purely in tort, we are not prepared to hold that the position of appellant is well taken, although the cases of Carter v. Goode, 50 Arkansas, 156, and Holland v. Park, 7 Tennessee (Peck), 151, would seem to go far in this direction. We believe the most that can be said from the record in this case is, that the laws of the Chickasaw Nation fail to authorize its courts to furnish a remedy in such cases, and do not go to the extent of making it lawful for persons to be guilty of negligence in the performance of a duty imposed upon them by law therein.
In Willis v. Railway, 61 Texas, 433, it is said: “ The rules governing suits arising out of torts committed in a locality other than the government where the redress is sought are about these, as deduced from the authorities upon the subject: Where the action is transitory, and is based on personal injuries recognized as such by universal law, the suit may be brought wherever the aggressor is found, irrespective of the provisions of the local law, or whether there be any law at all in force at the place where the wrong was committed.” Citing Rorer on Interstate Law, 154, 155. Without approving this statement of the law to the extent of holding that a cause of action in such cases would exist irrespective of the provisions of the local law, if the local law changed what is termed the universal law and made the act complained of lawful in that jurisdiction, we believe the rule laid down to be sound in cases where there is a simple failure to provide a remedy, without making the act lawful.
The courts of this State have held, that a plaintiff in cases of this kind has a right of action under what may be termed general or universal law, and that the measure of damages under such law is that administered in the court below; and we are of opinion, that inasmuch as it is not shown by the record that parties living in the Indian Territory are prohibited by the laws of that country from seeking relief, provided they can find the defendant in a jurisdiction which affords a remedy in such cases, and inasmuch as the appellant is a Texas corporation, and inasmuch as the contract with which it identified itself by receiving and undertaking to transmit and deliver the message was entered into by its connecting line in this State, we believe that our courts should not withhold redress for its violation.
As we find no error in any of the assignments interposed by the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company, we are of opinion that the judgment against it for $1000 should be affirmed, provided appellee, within thirty days, shall file in this court a release of all claim against the Western Union Telegraph Company, and dismiss this suit as to it; otherwise, the judgment of the court below must be reversed and remanded as to both appellants on account of the error committed as to the telegraph company. We do not wish to be understood as approving the practice adopted by the jury in attempting to apportion the damage between the defendants, as was done in this case; but we believe the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company is in no position to complain of this, nor has it attempted to do so.
Delivered March 9, 1893.
A motion for rehearing was overruled; and appellee having filed a remittitur as to the Western Union Telegraph Company, in compliance with the opinion, the judgment as to it was reversed and case dismissed, and affirmed as to appellant the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company."
216177,Eleanor H. Russell et al. v. James P. Bates et al.,1892-12-13,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On March 31,1883, the Legislature passed the following act: “Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That all surveys and patents by virtue of headright or bounty warrants issued under special laws enacted after March 3, 1870, and prior to April 1, 1876, to which there is no valid legal objection other than that such special laws are supposed to be in conflict with the Constitution then in force, are hereby validated and confirmed and declared to be as binding upon the State as they otherwise would be if such special laws had been permitted by the Constitution; provided, that if such headright or bounty certificate had been forfeited under existing laws by location and surveys on appropriated land, this act shall not be construed to revive the same; provided further, this act shall only apply to soldiers and heirs and actual settlers of Texas and their vendees to whom lands have been granted.”
On September 2, 1889, appellants filed their petition in the District Court of Denton County, alleging that on the 19th day of February, 1873, the Legislature of the State of Texas passed a special act granting to William J, Russell a certificate for 640 acres of land for his having participated in the campaign against Bexar in 1835, and also containing the necessary allegations that said Russell had in fact participated in said campaign so as to entitle him to said certificate. That this certificate was located on the land in controversy and patent was issued to said Russell on the 20th day of September, 1873. Appellants’ petition also showed that said William J. Russell died on the 5th day of November, 1881, and that they are his heirs, and they seek to recover of defendants, who are alleged to be trespassers, the land so patented.
Delivered December 13, 1892.
The court below sustained a general demurrer to appellants’ petition, holding, as we infer from the briefs of counsel, that the land having been patented to William J. Russell himself, and he being dead at the time of the passage of the Act of 1883, his heirs would have no claim to the land under said act. As an original proposition, the proper construction of this act would present questions of considerable difficulty; but since the decision of this case in the court below our Supreme Court has fully construed this statute, and, as we think correctly, held in such cases the heirs would be entitled to the land. Ralston v. Skerrett, 82 Texas, 486; also opinion of Commission of Appeals in same case, 17 S. W. Rep., 238.
The judgment of the court below will therefore be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
Reversed and remanded."
216202,S. J. McGrady v. James Monks,1892-12-13,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This is the second appeal in this case. The former appeal was taken by the appellee here, James Monks, and the judgment was reversed because the trial court refused to give a requested instruction submitting the issue of res adjudicata. Upon the last trial this charge was, in substance, given; and now the appellee in the former appeal, S. J. McGrady, seeks a reversal principally on the ground that it was given.
A full statement of the issues of law and fact arising upon the former appeal may be found in 71 Texas, 134. We find in this record substantially the same pleadings and proof as are there reported. The answer of James Monks is precisely the same, and the amended petition of S. J. McGrady contained in this record seems to be, in substance, the same as his former pleading. The facts stated in said report we find to be, in substance, the same as disclosed by this record.
Appellant’s first assignment of error reads as follows:
“ The court erred in excluding from the jury the testimony of witnesses D. H. Scott and Richard B. Semple, which was offered to prove that in the trial of McRae v. McGrady the issue made by the cross-bill of McGrady v. Monks was not the same issue as is made in the present suit, because in doing so the court excluded from the jury the evidence upon which the said issue of res adjudicata should have been determined, as required by the decision of our Supreme Court in this cause.”
In brief, the rejected testimony tended to show, that in the case of McRae v. McGrady the trial judge and the attorney for McGrady did not intend to try the issue as to the amount of damage sustained by McGrady on account of the alleged fraud and deceit in changing a clause of general warranty to that of special warranty; nor was any moneyed judgment sought against Monks, nor any reformation of said deed; but that the purpose in making him a party to said suit by said cross-action was to have him bound by any judgment that might be rendered in that suit depriving McGrady of the land, which judgment was expected to be used in the suit then about to be brought by McGrady for damages on account of the alleged fraud and deceit.
We are of opinion that this testimony tended to vary and contradict the record, and to substitute the opinion and understanding of witnesses as to the meaning and effect of the pleadings and judgment in that ease for the legal construction thereof by the court trying this case. There are cases where oral evidence is admissible to show what was determined in the former suit, but this is clearly not one of that class. Roberts v. Johnson, 48 Texas, 133; 2 Whart. Ev., 157, note 1 at end of sec. 988; also end of sec. 785, vol. 1. We are further of the opinion that the testimony, if admitted, could not have changed the result. According to appellant’s own theory, said Monks was made a party to the original suit on the alleged ground that Monks was liable to McGrady on a covenant of general warranty which had been fraudulently changed to a special warranty, which liability was denied by said Monks, and this issue, at least, was tried and determined in the original suit. It could not be determined that he was liable as warrantor, and hence properly brought before the court to be bound by the judgment rendered therein, without proving the identical fraud and transaction alleged in this suit as the foundation for a recovery. The alleged wrong constitutes an essential part of the cause of action, whether the suit be upon the warranty or for damages for the deceit merely, and until that is established no damage could be recovered in either suit. It seems clear to us that appellant is not entitled to have a second trial of the same issue determined in the original suit, merely because in the subsequent suit he has a different purpose in view and seeks different relief.
The point is made, that after filing his original answer, which contained the cross-petition, an amended original answer was filed, which must be held under the rules of pleading to take the place of the former pleading. It seems, however, whether properly so or not, that the issue was tried under the cross-action as set up in the original answer, and this must be held to be conclusive in a subsequent suit where the question arises collaterally.
Delivered December 13, 1892.
The questions raised by the other assignments have all been passed upon and decided correctly, as we think, by the Supreme Court on the former appeal.
The judgment will therefore be affirmed.
Affirmed."
216252,J. W. Welborn et al. v. P. J. Norwood,1892-12-13,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
August 20, 1889, the appellee, P. J. Norwood, brought this suit against J. W. Welborn and T. H. Griffin, appellants, in the County Court of Johnson County, to recover the sum of $194.26, besides interest and 10 per cent attorney fees, as evidenced by a promissory note executed by appellants to appellee. Appellants filed a special defense, charging failure of consideration, in this, that the note sued upon was executed in consideration-of a promise by plaintiff that he would deliver to defendants a certain promissory note for the sum of $173.45, which had been previously drawn in favor of plaintiff by P. H. Welborn and two others, and that plaintiff had failed and refused to deliver up, in compliance with his promise, the note so previously executed.
Delivered December 13, 1892.
To this plea the court sustained a special exception, and we think correctly. The plea nowhere specifies that the plaintiff undertook to surrender the note at any particular time. If, as stated in the plea, the note sued upon was received by the plaintiff in consideration of the cancellation of the substituted note, the latter could constitute no obligation against the defendants, whether it was actually surrendered or not. The time of performance in no way appears to have been of the essence of the agreement to surrender, and the plaintiff, by the terms of the agreement, was not called upon to surrender the former note before asserting the latter. Tied, on Com. Paper, sec. 204.
Appellant Welborn filed a further defense, alleging that the consideration for said note was illegal, in this, that the note sued upon was executed in consideration of the “promise of the plaintiff to refrain and desist from prosecuting P. H. Welborn, who is the son of this defendant (J. W. Welborn), for forging and passing a certain note alleged by plaintiff to have been forged by P. H. Welborn, and to conceal from the officers of the law all the information and knowledge that the plaintiff had of the fact that P. H. Welborn had forged and passed said note.” The note referred to as forged was the note already referred to for $173.45, executed by P. H. Welborn and two others in favor of plaintiff. A special exception was sustained to this plea, and we think erroneously. The ground of the exception is, that the answer 16 does not allege by any positive averment that P. H. Welborn forged said note for $173.45.” The answer does show an agreement not to prosecute P. H. Welborn for forgery. It shows an agreement on the part of the plaintiff, in consideration of the note sued on, to stifle a prosecution and to suppress evidence with reference to the investigation of a felony. We think these facts, if true, were sufficient to taint the contract and avoid it. Wegner Bros. v. Biering & Co., 65 Texas, 509; Tied. on Com. Paper, sec. 183.
The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.

The land in controversy in this suit, consisting of a tract of 642 acres and a tract of 3337 acres, situated in Wichita County, was patented in the month of August, 1884, in the name of M. M. Purinton, as assignee of Bonato Leona. These patents were issued by virtue of a duplicate certificate for a league and labor of land, issued in the name of said Bonato Leona by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, Becember 4, 1874, in lieu of headright certificate alleged to have been issued to said Bonato Leona by the Board of Land Commissioners of Nacogdoches County, March 24, 1838. The duplicate certificate was issued upon a showing made of the loss of the original by S. H. Cooper, through his attorney in fact, G. W. Biamond, under a purported conveyance of this original certificate from Bonato Leona to said Cooper, of date of January 3,1848, and recorded in 1883. In the year 1875 the duplicate certificate was located on the land in controversy. By deed dated October 4, 1883, said Biamond, under power of attorney from Cooper of about the same date, conveyed the land to M. M. Purinton. Bonato Leona lived in Nacogdoches County from 1834 to 1838, and died in 1839. It is manifest that the purported conveyance from Bonato Leona to Cooper was a forgery.
In March, 1878, prior to the issuance of said patents, Gunter & Mun-son located valid land certificates on the larger of the two tracts of land in controversy. Their location, in conflict with said larger survey, consisted of three sections of land of 640 acres each, numbered 7, 8, and 9, of which No. 8 was located for the State; and at the same time they located for the State also survey No. 10.
In July, 1890, J. N. Lee, claiming in right of the heirs of Donato Leona, instituted a suit to recover the lands in controversy of those claiming under the patent to M. M. Purinton, including Meade & Bomar. In February, 1891, Gunter & Munson instituted a suit against Meade & Bomar to recover so much of the larger tract of land in controversy as was covered by their location. These two suits were consolidated, and the State of Texas intervened, claiming the land not covered by the odd sections of Gunter & Munson, and asking to have the patents issued to Purinton cancelled. The cause was tried without a jury, and judgment was rendered in favor of the State, cancelling said patents, and in favor of Gunter & Munson for the recovery of the land claimed by them, from which judgment the other parties have appealed.
The record contains no conclusions of law and fact, but the trial court must have found that there never was- in existence an original headright certificate to Donato Leona for a league and labor of land in lieu of which the duplicate certificate was issued. After a careful consideration of the facts contained in the record, we conclude that the preponderance of the evidence sustains this finding. It appears from the evidence, however, that there was an original certificate issued March 27, 1838, by the Board of Land Commissioners of Nacogdoches County, to John L. Roberts and George Allen, assignees of Donato Leona, for one labor of land, which was approved as a valid certificate to Donato Leona for one labor of land, by the Board of Land Commissioners appointed to detect fraudulent land certificates under the law of 1840. It appears also that the Mexican government granted to Donato Leona a league of land as a colonist, located in Angelina County, in the year 1834.
In the year 1889, Meade & Bomar instituted suit -against Gunter & Munson to remove cloud from their title to 1322^ acres of the larger tract in controversy, alleging, as one ground for relief, that they had acquired title under the three years statute of limitations. In that suit the trial court found that they had not had such continuous possession as would sustain their plea under the three years limitation, but found that they were innocent purchasers and entitled to recover against Gunter & Munson. The Supreme Court, in October, 1890, on appeal from this judgment, held that Meade & Bomar showed no such title as to warrant a judgment in their favor, and reversed and rendered judgment for Gunter & Munson. Section No. 7 of the Gunter & Munson location was involved in that suit.
The statement of facts in this record contains an admission that upon the trial of said suit proof on the question of limitation of three years was introduced pro and con by both parties, and passed upon by the court in favor of Gunter & Munson, and that Meade & Bomar introduced the patent and their claim of title thereunder as shown in this case. It was also admitted that Meade & Bomar and those under whom they claimed had been in peaceable, adverse, and exclusive possession of said 1322 acres of the larger tract in controversy, cultivating, using, and enjoying the same, and paying taxes as they accrued, since May 5, 1885; and that M. M. Purinton entered into the possession of the balance of the larger tract on May 15, 1886, and that she and the defendants claiming under her had been in the actual, adverse, and exclusive possession thereof ever since, paying taxes thereon regularly as they accrued. It was neither proven nor admitted that the possession of any of the parties was held under deeds duly registered. It was further admitted that Meade & Bomar bought the 1322 acres of land claimed by them, and paid value therefor, without any notice of defect in title, and that A. J. Roberts bought in the same way.
In the case of Gunter & Munson v. Meade & Bomar, 78 Texas, 634, it is held, that inasmuch as a duplicate certificate professes to confer no rights other than such as the original gave, if there be no original it confers no right whatever. This decision rests upon a finding by the trial court in that case (which was sustained by the Supreme Court) that the records of the General Land Office did not show that any original certificate for a league and labor of land had ever been issued by the Board of Land Commissioners for Nacogdoches County to Donato Leona, but that a colonist’s grant for one league of. land had been made to him by the government in 1835, which was situated in Angelina County, and that that board issued to the assignees of Leona a certificate for one labor of land.
It follows from the conclusions of fact set forth above and the law as announced in that case, that J. N. Lee, who is admitted to have such rights as the heirs of Donato Leona would be entitled to maintain in this suit, can not recover, against Gunter & Munson and the State of Texas, the land sued for by him. It also follows, as we think, that the other parties to the suit who claim under the patent to M. M. Purinton can not successfully resist a recovery herein of the land sued for by the State; nor can they prevent a recovery by Gunter & Munson unless the defense interposed under the statutes of limitation can avail them. The five years statute can not be invoked, because the record contains no proof that they held under deed or deeds duly registered.
It is contended by counsel for Gunter & Munson that the three years clause can not avail Meade & Bomar as to section No. 7, because the decision in the former suit of Meade & Bomar v. Gunter & Munson precludes this defense as being res adjudicata. We are of opinion that this contention can not be sustained. This record discloses that, on the former trial, proof was introduced pro and con.as to the possession, but does not show what that proof was, nor that it was identical with the proof upon the last trial. This issue on the former trial was determined against Meade & Bomar, because the proof failed to show at that time a sufficient continuous possession. It is admitted in the statement of facts that on the last trial a possession of the requisite character was held by Meade & Bomar and those under whom they claimed, from May 5, 1885, up to that time.
We have, however, reached the conclusion, that under the construction placed upon the three years statute of limitations by our Supreme Court, inasmuch as possession is held under a grant void for want of power in the officer issuing it, none of the defendants in this case can avail themselves of this defense. While the decided cases establish the rule that the three years clause of the statute of limitations is applicable where the patent purports to pass the legal title, and does pass all the title the State has or can convey, though in fact no title passes to the grantee; yet a proper observance of the distinctions made in these and analogous cases seems to us to lead to the conclusion, that where the patent is utterly void for want of authority in the officer issuing it, and does not in any manner bind the State, giving no protection, as title, against any person, the three years adverse possessor can not prescribe under it. League v. Rogan, 59 Texas, 427; Davilla v. Mumford, 24 How., 23; Smith v. Power, 23 Texas, 33; Bates v. Bacon, 66 Texas, 348; Gunter & Munson v. Meade & Bomar, 78 Texas, 634; Marsh v. Weir, 21 Texas, 110; Steagall v. Huff, 54 Texas, 193; Veramendi v. Hutchins, 48 Texas, 531.
The decision in Winsor v. O’Connor, 69 Texas, 571, construing section 4, article 14, of our Constitution, and interpreting the phrase “ land titled,” might seem to be in conflict with this result. It seems to us, however, that a patent might be entirely without efficacy to pass any character of title as against the State, or to give protection, as title, against any person, and still be held effective, by force of that provision of our Constitution, enacted in furtherance of public policy and not to confer any private right, to withdraw the land from location.
The point is made by appellants in their brief, that if it be assumed that the original certificate to Donato Leona was only for one labor of land, the Commissioner, in issuing a duplicate, was not entirely without jurisdiction to act, and that therefore the grant, though excessive, would not be absolutely void, but only voidable, citing the case of Maxey v. O’Connor, 23 Texas, 235. This question, though not expressly decided, seems to have been, in effect, passed upon in the case of Gunter & Mun-son v. Meade & Bomar, discussed above. It is not entirely clear to the mind of the writer, however, that this contention is without force.
Delivered December 13, 1892.
These conclusions dispose of all the assignments of error which relate to the merits of the controversy.
The objections raised by exception to the authority of the Attorney-General to intervene in the name of the State are not well taken. Rev. Stats., art. 1265; Laws 1887, p. 138; The State v. Delesdenier, 7 Texas, 95; The State v. Thompson, 64 Texas, 690.
The assignments which relate to the admission of testimony are likewise not well taken. A part of the deposition of R. M. Hall, Commissioner of the Land Office, might not have been admissible, but the court before whom the case was tried without a jury, in the explanation appended to the bill of exceptions, states that the testimony which we think was objectionable was excluded from his consideration.
It follows that the judgment of the court below must be in all things affirmed.
Affirmed.
A motion for rehearing in this case was overruled."
219232,William E. Hitson v. Walter A. Glascock,1893-03-09,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
From the conclusions of fact, which we adopt, there being no statement of facts, it appears, that in the year 1890 appellee made application to purchase a section of school land in Fisher County as an actual settler, the land being classed as agricultural, and accompanied his application with the affidavit, as provided in the Act of 1887, that he had settled on the land. A similar proceeding had been inaugurated in the name of his mother in 1888, who thereafter, joined by her husband, transferred her claim to him. These applications, accompanied with the proper obligations, were accepted in succession by the Commissioner of the Land Office, and the required payments of interest were duly made. Neither of said parties had at tlie dates of these applications, or at any other time, settled on the land, but were then, as well as up to the time of the trial, living on section 58, seven miles from the land in question.
After these applications had been made, appellant went into the actual possession of the land and settled upon it in good faith, as provided in the Act of 1887; and in August, 1890, forwarded to the General Land Office his application, affidavit, obligation, and partial payment, as required by said Act of 1887, to purchase the land as an actual settler, which were refused by the Commissioner of the General Land Office. Thereafter this suit was brought to dispossess him; and though the court found that he was an actual settler in good faith at the time of the trial, and had been since the 19th day of July, 1890, judgment was entered in favor of appellee, from which this appeal is prosecuted.
In the case of Metzler v. Johnson [1 Texas Civil Appeals, 137], the question here submitted was passed upon. In addition to what is there said, we will only add, that according to our construction of the Act of 1887, providing for the sale of lands set apart for the benefit of the public free school fund, as the land was not subject to sale in the absence of an actual settler, the Commissioner had no power to accept a purchaser for the land in controversy so long as it remained vacant and unoccupied. The condition did not obtain which authorized him to act until appellant settled upon the land.
Under a law empowering the Commissioner to issue a duplicate certificate for land where the original has been lost or destroyed, it has been decided that his power to issue the duplicate rests upon the fact that an original certificate once existed, and not upon the evidence of its original existence and loss; and hence that a duplicate issued where no original ever existed confers no right whatever. Gunter & Munson v. Meade & Bomar, 78 Texas, 638. The affidavit of appellee, as required by section 9 of the Act of 1887, that he had in good faith settled on the land, when in fact he had not, did not empower the Commissioner to sell the land to him or anybody else, because, as provided, in effect, in section 5, the land was not subject to sale until there was in fact an actual settler on it.
The judgment will be reversed and here rendered for appellant.
Reversed and rendered.

219196,Rosa Carlton et al. v. J. K. Miller,1893-03-09,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
This writ of error is prosecuted to reverse a judgment by default rendered on the 19th of May, 1883, in favor of defendant in error against Mollie Shockley, for the sum of @441.71, and foreclosing the vendor’s lien on block 42 in the city of Denison. The original petition in the case in which the judgment was rendered alleged, that on the 17th of January, 1877, L. ""W"". Carlton and Mollie Carlton, his wife, executed the note sued on, since which L. W. Carleton has died, leaving surviving him his said wife and three minor children whose given names were unknown to plaintiff, but all of whom resided in Grayson County, Texas; that L. W. Carleton died intestate, and there had been no administration on his estate. This petition contains no distinct averment that the note sued on was given for the land upon which the lien was foreclosed, but the note was copied in the petition, and it recited this fact, and also that it was secured by a deed of trust on said property; and the prayer of the petition was for judgment for the debt, interest, and costs, and for a foreclosure of his lien upon said land, and for general and special relief.
The citation commanded the sheriff to summon Mollie Carlton,Carlton,-- Carlton, and-Carlton. The return on the citation shows that it was executed on the 11th day of February, 1882, by delivering to Curtis A. Carlton, Bosa Carlton, Ernest Carlton, and Mollie Carlton, alias Mollie Shockley, each in person, a true copy of the citation.
On September 12, 1882, the case seems to have been dismissed by the court upon its own motion, for want of prosecution. On December 20, 1882, and at the same term of the court at which the dismissal was had, the court, upon motion of the plaintiff, without notice to the defendants, reinstated the case.
On March 5, 1883, defendant in error file'd an amended original petition, alleging the loss of the note by his attorney, and that since the institution of the suit the defendant Mollie Carleton had married William Shockley; that the given names of the other defendants were as stated in the sheriff’s return; -that the note was given for a part of the purchase money of block 42 in the city of Denison; and concluded with a prayer for citation to the defendants to answer said amended petition, for the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the minor defendants, and for judgment for his debt and foreclosure of his lien. At the same term of the court, J. R. Cox was appointed guardian ad litem as prayed for in the petition, and answered for- the minors, denying all the allegations in the petition, “except the making and executing of the note and the purchase of the land mentioned;” and on the next day judgment by default was rendered in favor of plaintiff for the balance due on the note against the defendant Mollie Shockley, and foreclosing the vendor’s lien as above set forth.
The defendant in error moves to dismiss the writ of error, on the ground that plaintiffs in error are seeking to prosecute the same by a next friend instead of by their guardian ad litem appointed by the court to represent their interests in the controversy; the contention being that he alone has the right to say whether or not the case shall be brought for revision to this court. The question presented is not without difficulty, but we are of opinion that the motion is not well taken. Statutes regulating the practice in suits instituted in behalf of or against infants are generally enacted for their protection, and are not to be used to their injury, they being generally regarded as wards of the court, whose interests are not to be sacrificed through unnecessary technicalities.
In Robson v. Osborne, 13 Texas, 298, it is said; “It seems that, in general, any one who will undertake the office may be the prochein amy of an infant, and may maintain the suit in that capacity, if it appears to the court to be for the benefit of the infant. And although an infant has a guardian assigned him by the court, or appointed by will, yet where he is plaintiff, the course in chancery, it is said, is not to call the guardian by that name, but to call him the next friend. Bradley v. Amidon, 10 Paige, 235; Dan. Chan. Prac., 89. An infant may sue by his next friend, notwithstanding he have a guardian, if the guardian do not dissent. Thomas v. Dike, 11 Vt., 273; Dan. Chan. Prac., ch. 3, part 2, title ‘Infants.’ A fortiori, he may do so where the guardian has left the country, and has failed in the performance of duties which, devolved upon him for the preservation of the rights of his ward.”
In this case it is not made to appear that the guardian ad litem has left the country; but it seems that he has failed to bring the case before this court for a period of about eight years, from which it may be inferred that he has no intention of doing so. It does not appear, however, from the record that he objects to the prosecution of this writ of error, and we are of opinion that under the circumstances the minors against whom the judgment was rendered should not be denied the right to a hearing in this court when their interests are presented by a prochein amy. We believe these views are sustained by the reasoning of our Supreme Court, after full consideration on rehearing in the case of Brooke v. Clark, 57 Texas, 105. The motion to dismiss the writ of error will therefore be overruled.
Upon its merits, the case presents the anomaly of plaintiffs in error bringing before us for revision a judgment which they contend is not final because it does not dispose of all the parties to the controversy. If the judgment, as contended for by them, is not final, we would have ño jurisdiction further than to dismiss the writ of error at their cost; but upon examination, we are of opinion that the judgment complained of does finally dispose of the entire subject matter of the controversy as to all of the parties. The plaintiff in the court below did not seek a personal judgment against any of the defendants except Mrs. Mollie Shockley, against whom it was rendered, and the defendant William Shockley was only made a party pro forma as husband of his codefendant, and the other defendants were made parties as the heirs of the deceased L. W. Carlton, no judgment being sought against them except a foreclosure of the vendor’s lien upon the land for which the note was given; and we think the effect of the judgment was to foreclose the lien against all of the parties to the suit, although they were not specifically named in the clause granting such foreclosure.
Plaintiffs in error, in their first proposition under their first assignment, contend that the judgment by default against them was erroneous, because their given names were not stated in the original petition, nor in the citation served upon them, and no citation was issued upon or service had under the amended petition, and we believe this objection to the judgment to be well taken. The original petition alleged that these parties resided in the county in which the suit was instituted, and gave no reason why their names could not be ascertained. We have a statute which authorizes a suit against unknown heirs, and in such eases service is had by publication. Eev. Stats., art. 1236. Where personal service is sought, one of the requirements of the statute is that the citation shall contain the names of all the parties. Eev. Stats., art. 1215.
The question presented to us is not whether the judgment, for the reasons here indicated, would be void upon collateral attack, but the question is, was the proceeding regular? We are constrained to hold that it was not. Appellee seeks to sustain the judgment upon the ground, that inasmuch as it contains a recital that all the defendants had been cited by personal service, this should be presumed, and that we should presume that service had been had upon the amended petition as prayed for therein; but this position can not be sustained. To sustain a judgment by default on appeal, the record must show good service outside of the recital in the judgment. Burditt v. Howth, 45 Texas, 466; Fitch v. Boyer, 51 Texas, 344; Wheeler v. Ahrenbeak, 54 Texas, 536; Treadway v. Eastburn, 57 Texas, 214; Hart v. Weatherford, 19 Texas, 57. Besides, it will be observed that a judgment by default was taken at the same term at which the amendment was filed, and it would seem that the service recited in the judgment could not have been had. It is true William Shocklev might have accepted service, but the minors could only have been served in the regular way. Wheeler v. Ahrenbeak, supra.
Plaintiffs in error, in their third and fifth assignments, seek to take advantage of the alleged irregularity in rendering a personal judgment against the defendant Mrs. Mollie Shockley without service upon her husband, and also because it appears from the petition that she was a married woman at the time she signed the note, but as she is not a party to this writ of error, we are of opinion that these assignments should not bo considered.
We are of opinion that the court below had the power to reinstate the case after its dismissal at the same term, without notice to the defendants. Hooker v. Williamson, 60 Texas, 524; Wood v. Wheeler, 7 Texas, 13; Blum v. Wettermark, 58 Texas, 125; Williams v. Huling, 43 Texas, 113.
For the error above indicated, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.

216297,Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. John H. Paine,1892-12-13,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This is an appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Denton County, for the sum of $615.28, rendered February 28, 1889, in favor of appellee against appellant. The suit was for damages alleged to have been caused by the negligence and default of defendant, a common carrier, in the transportation by rail of 143 head of cattle, shipped by plaintiff on the 14th day of June, 1888, from Den-ton, Texas, to Chicago, Illinois. Two head of cattle, worth $50 and $40 respectively, are alleged to have been crippled and rendered worthless by negligent switching of cars at Chetopa and Sedalia. A delay of twenty-four hours in their transportation was alleged to have caused deterioration in the weight and grade and decline in the market price of the cattle to the extent of $517.20. Plaintiff also claimed $33 for extra feed bills caused by the delay.
The damages found'by the court were itemized as follows:
“ (1) The steer lost at Chetopa, $50; (2) the steer lost at Sedalia, $40; (3) the extra feed at Sedalia, $33; (4) the difference between the price obtained for said cattle on the 19th day of June, 1889, to-wit, $4.40 per 100 pounds, and the price said cattle could have been sold for on the 18th day of June, 1889, to-wit, $4.65 per 100 pounds, said difference being 25 cents on the 100 pounds, the weight of the 141 head at Chicago, to-wit, 147,280 pounds, at 25 cents, $368.20; (5) amount lost in weight on the fifth day said cattle were in transit, to-wit, 2820 pounds, at $4.40 per 100 pounds, $124.08; total, $615.28.”
The defendant, in addition to the general issue, pleaded specially that the plaintiff had wholly failed, in compliance with its contract of shipment, to give notice of the loss as therein stipulated. By this contract the plaintiff agreed, that “as a condition precedent to his right to any damages or any loss or injury to his said stock during the transportation thereof, or previous to loading thereof for shipment, he will give notice in writing of his claim therefor to some general officer of defendant, or to its nearest station agent, or to the agent at the delivering station of the railway which carries the stock to destination, or to the nearest station agent or general officer of such delivering road, before said stock is removed from the point of shipment or from the place of destination, and before such stock is mingled with other stock, and one day after the delivery of such stock at its point of destination and before the same have been removed or intermingled with other stock, to the end that such claim may be fully and fairly investigated; and that a failure to comply with the terms of this clause shall be a complete bar to any recovery of any and all such claims. The written notice herein provided for can not, and shall not, be waived by any person except such general officer or station agent, and by him only in writing.”
The defendant, in connection with this contract, alleged, that it had stations and station agents at Chetopa, Kansas, and Sedaba and Hannibal, Missouri; and that the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Bail way Company, its connecting line which transported the cattle from Hannibal to Chicago, Illinois, their destination, had stations and station agents and its general offices and officers in Chicago.
The trial court, hearing the case without a jury, held this contract unreasonable and invalid, and appellant complains of this conclusion as error.
The record contains no statement of facts. The court’s conclusions of fact, however, with reference to the contract, are as follows:
“1. I find that said written and printed contract, under which plaintiff shipped said cattle, nowhere gives the names of any of their agents or general officers along their line of road over which plaintiff shipped said cattle. That plaintiff knew of no agent or general office of defendant at Chicago. Got a pass there of some man to come home on.
“2. That defendant had a station and station agent at Sedaba, Missouri, and Hannibal, Missouri, and a ticket agent at Chicago, Hlinois, from whom plaintiff procured his pass to return to Denton.
“ 3. That defendant’s line terminated at Hannibal, Missouri, where it connected with the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railway, to which line said cattle were transferred at that point and transported by said Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railway Company to their destination at Chicago, Ibinois; and that at Chicago said Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railway had a station and station agent, whom plaintiff saw and talked with while in Chicago, and also that the general offices and officers of said Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Bail way Company were also in Chicago.”
The concluding two of the foregoing findings were added by the court at the request of the defendant.
The contract in question as pleaded is upon its face unreasonable. It fails to state the name of the agent in Chicago to whom the notice was to be given. It required the plaintiff to leave his stock, on the arrival of the cars at the point of destination, and within twenty-four hours to seek and find the person to whom notice should be given, without indieating to him whether or where such person would be found, or at what hour he would be found at his place of business. It may well be conceived that a large corporation in an immense city has numerous agents engaged in different departments of its business other than the particular agent charged with the duty of investigating claims of the character here in question. We can understand how the shipper, under such circumstances, would interview one after another of these agents, only to be truthfully told by each agent interviewed that he was not authorized to pass upon such a demand.
We do not hold that a contract requiring the shipper to give notice is necessarily invalid, but we do hold that it is unreasonable and can not be enforced unless it be made to appear that the person to be notified is so conveniently accessible to the person who is to give the notice as that the latter can reasonably discharge that duty within the time limited by the contract. The burden rests upon the carrier to show that this condition exists, either by the terms of the contract indicating that the requisite information is thus furnished to the shipper, or that the latter is in fact possessed of such information, from what source soever it may come. See Railway v. Childers, ante, 302, in which Head, Associate Justice, elaborately reviews the decisions of our Supreme Court on this subject.
We therefore consider whether, under the facts found by the court, we are at liberty to say that the court below erred in concluding that the contract here relied upon is unreasonable.
These facts are that .the defendant company had a ticket agent in Chicago, from whom plaintiff procured his pass to return to Denton, and that the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railway Company had also there a station and station agent whom plaintiff saw and talked with while in Chicago.
Under the terms of the contract, the plaintiff was required to give notice within twenty-four hours after the arrival of the stock. It does not appear that the transaction and conversations with the agents above mentioned were had within this time. If, in fact, these occurrences did take place within the limit stated, it would seem to follow that the defendant could have proved this fact. So it might well be concluded that, in fact, the shipper had not discovered these agents and that he was unable to discover them until after the lapse of the time within which the notice was required to be given. In any event, the facts stated will not justify us in reversing a finding by the lower court that the defendant had failed to fulfill the task imposed upon it of showing that the contract relied upon by it was reasonable.
The appellant in its next assignment of error complains of the fourth item of damages as not justified by the facts found by the court. This contention we sustain.
This item, for $368.20, is founded upon the difference between the market value of the cattle as they were actually sold on June 19, 1889, and such market value if they had been sold on June 18, 1889. According to the findings of the court, the cattle left Denton, Texas, about 9 p. m. June 14, and reached Chicago about 7 or 8 o’clock a. m. June 19. If the carrier had used proper diligence, the cattle would have reached Chicago in about four days after their departure, or about 9 p. m. June 18. The cattle market in Chicago usually opened about 9 o’clock a. m. and closed about 12 o’clock m. or 1 p. m. Cattle arriving after the close of market hours would be held over until next day before being sold. It thus appears that the negligence of the carrier did not affect the price of the cattle with reference to the time of their sale. Had they reached Chicago within due time (about 9 o’clock p. m. on June 18th), their arrival would have been too late for the market of that day; nor could they have been sold before they actually were sold during the market hours of the next day, June 19th. The court elsewhere finds that the delay was “ about one day,” and on this finding it evidently predicates the conclusion that the owner was deprived of the market of the 18th of June. We are of opinion that the fixing by the court of the hours of departure from Denton and of arrival in Chicago determines more accurately the duration of the journey, and indicates that there was not a delay of a day nor the consequent loss to the plaintiff of a sale on June 18. We therefore deduct from the amount of the judgment below the fourth item of damages $368.20, and here render judgment for the difference, viz., $247.08, with legal interest Lrom the date of the judgment below.

Appellant prosecutes this appeal from a judgment awarding to appellee the sum of $500 as damages on account of the failure of the appellant to deliver the telegram herein below set out.
Appellee lived near Dexter, in Cooke County, Texas. His minor son, Ed. Carter, had been working at Marietta, in the Indian Territory, about fourteen miles west of Dexter, when he was taken sick, and after an illness of twenty-eight days, died on October 29, 1889, about 3:30 o’clock p.m. About 4 p. m. of that day the appellee, in company with Dr. Applewhite, who, as a physician, had treated the son during his last illness, went to appellant’s office, and Dr. Applewhite, for the appellee and at his request, caused to be prepared and sent the following message, for which appellee, through Dr. Applewhite, paid 25 cents:
“Marietta, I. T., October 29, 1889. ‘■‘■Frank Morris, Gainesville, Texas:
“Ed. is dead. Send coffin six feet four inches long on morning express.
[Signed] “ B. L. Applewhite.”
The object of this telegram was to procure a coffin in which to bury the corpse of the deceased son. It was appellee’s desire to convey the body for interment near his home in Texas. He wished to leave wi*b the body early on the morning of October 30, so as to reach the graveyard in time for interment on the evening of that day. The message was received at appellant’s office at Gainesville at 4:40 p. m. of October 30. Mr. Morris, the addressee, was the tax collector of Cooke County, his office being about 300 yards from appellant’s office, and his residence being in the same town and conveniently accessible. By reasonable diligence the message could have been delivered to Mr. Morris by 5 p. m. on the day on which it was received. It was not delivered until after 9 o’clock a. m. of the next day. The appellant was thus guilty of negligence. As a consequence, the coffin was not procured and sent (as it would have been) by the express train of the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway which left Gainesville so as to reach Marietta at 7 o’clock a. m. As a further consequence, Mr. Morris did not send the coffin so as to reach the appellee before 6 p. m. of October 30, too late to make the journey to the cemetery. The interment was thus delayed until 2 or 3 o’clock p. m. of October 31—a delay of twenty-four hours. In the meanwhile the body began to decompose and became very offensive, thus causing appellee great distress of mind. When the coffin failed to arrive in accordance with the telegram, appellee diligently sought to procure one at Marietta, but failed.
Appellee testified, that at the time the message was sent and paid for he told the agent of appellant that he wanted the coffin for the corpse of his son. There was evidence of a negative character tending to contradict this statement.
The trial court, as indicated by its ruling upon the defendant’s general demurrer, and by the charges which it gave and the requested instructions which it refused, was of opinion that the grief and mental anguish sustained by the plaintiff was an element of damage proper to be considered by the jury in passing upon the defendant’s failure to comply with its. contract to deliver the telegram.
Appellant’s first, second, fifth, seventh, and eighth assignments of error complain of this view. The doctrine, that damage of this character may be considered the natural and direct consequences of a failure to transmit a telegraphic message such as the one in question, has become so firmly fixed in our jurisprudence that the action of the appellant seems scarcely to be justified in requiring us to reannounce it. Stuart v. Tel. Co., 66 Texas,, 581; Tel. Co. v. Broesche, 72 Texas, 654; Hale v. Bonner, 82 Texas, 33.,
Appellant’s petition contains certain averments (which we do not find: necessary to specifically set out) having reference to a conversation between the addressee, Morris, and appellant’s agent at Gainesville, after the delivery of the telegram. Appellant, in its third assignment of error, complains of the action of the court in overruling a special exception addressed by it to these averments. As appellee introduced no evidence whatever in support of these allegations, it is impossible, in our opinion, that the action complained of could have been detrimental to the defendant. Tel. Co. v. Evans, decided by this court November 1, 1892 [1 Texas Civ. Apps., 297].
The testimony showed that appellee was the principal of Dr. Apple-white, who sent the message, and that he had a beneficial interest in it. The court therefore did not err in refusing appellant’s special instruction, to the effect that appellee had no beneficial interest in the telegram.
Appellant’s third special instruction, of the refusal of which it complains in its sixth assignment of error, was given quite literally in that portion of the court’s charge in which the jury were instructed, that unless they should find from the evidence “ that defendant’s agent at Marietta knew at the time he accepted said message for transmission that it was sent for the benefit of plaintiff, the jury would find for the defendant.” Indeed, this instruction might well have been complained of by the plaintiff, for it has been held in Telegraph Company v. Broesche, 72 Texas, 657, that such knowledge on the part of the agent is not necessary to the plaintiff’s cause of action.
The judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed.

216180,"The Saint Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company in Texas v. W. J. Turner",1892-12-20,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On June 9, 1888, appellant received for shipment by the same train at Brandon, in Hill County, Texas, to be carried to East St. Louis, in the State of Illinois, 46 head of cattle for •one A. Roberts, 70 head of cattle for E. Roberts, 63 head of cattle for Sloan & Roberts, 48 head of cattle for D. B. Sloan, 26 head of cattle for Dyer Bros., 22 head of cattle for W. J. Turner; and at Kerens, in Navarro County, Texas, it received from J. J. Goodnight 49 head of cattle, to be carried, by the same train as those above named, from said place to East St. Louis, in the State of Illinois.
At the time of receiving said cattle as aforesaid, each of said parties, with the agent of appellant, executed a separate written contract, in each of which it was stipulated that said parties agreed, that “as a condition precedent to his right to any damages for any loss or injury to his stock during the transportation thereof or previous to loading thereof for shipment, he would give notice in writing, verified by affidavit, of his claim therefor to some general officer of said first party, or to its nearest station agent, before said stock is removed from the point of shipment or from the place of destination, and before said stock are mingled with other stock, within one day after the delivery of such stock at its point of destination, and before the .same shall have been removed, etc., to the end that such claim may be fully and fairly investigated; and that a failure to fully comply with the terms of this clause shall be a complete bar to any recovery of any and all such claims.”
In reaching East St. Louis, the point of destination, it was necessary for said cattle to pass over the line of a connecting carrier from Cairo, Illinois, which was the terminus of appellant’s line, and at East St. Louis appellant had no general officer or station agent within the meaning of the contract aforesaid, but from one to two miles distant therefrom, at St. Louis, in the State of Missouri, it did have its general offices and general officers within the meaning of said contract, but the evidence does not show which, if any, of these was present at the office of appellant during the day on which the notice called for in the contract was required to be given.
The first feeding station after loading the cattle would have been at Texarkana, in the State of Texas; but the cattle having arrived there on time, and not having been in the cars longer than 23 or 24 hours, on the suggestion of the conductor of appellant that they would be able to reach Pine Bluff, the next feeding station, on time, appellee agreed that the cattle need not be unloaded until they reached this last named station. Between Texarkana and Pine Bluff, however, one of appellant’s trains had been derailed, preventing the passage of the train containing these cattle and causing their delay for about 8 or 9 hours, and thus kept the cattle in the cars from 41 to 45 hours without unloading, feeding, or watering. The evidence shows that after cattle have been kept in cars as much as 28 hours they damage very rapidly, causing them to become feverish, so that when they reach food and water they take too much, and that the damage thus caused is not remedied by subsequent good treatment on the journey.
The damage found by the court below to have been caused by the unusual delay above set forth was estimated at $1555 upon all of the cattle, including those of Goodnight. The court also found that this damage was caused by negligence on the part of appellant; and also that the contract requiring notice to be given by appellees was not reasonable under the circumstances of this case. No notice as called for in the contract was, in fact, given of this damage. Appellee, on July 23, 1888, filed this suit to recover the damage so caused to all of the cattle above named, alleging transfers from the other owners to him of their claims for such damage, and on the trial he proved such transfers from all the parties except, Goodnight, but proved no transfer from him. In his petition he alleged the damage to be $5 per head, and on the trial recovered judgment for $1555, as above stated.
Appellee tenders in this court a remittitur of $245, being $5 per head on the 49 head of Goodnight cattle, together with interest thereon at 8 per cent per annum from the date of the ""judgment, and asks that the judgment rendered below as to the remainder of such damage be affirmed.
Appellant’s first assignment of error complains of the action of the court below in overruling its general demurrer to appellee’s petition. Appellant’s objection to the petition, as we gather from the propositions made under this assignment, is, that it is not sufficiently specific in stating the damage to the cattle and the difference in their market value caused by the treatment complained of therein. We are of opinion that the petition was sufficient, on general demurrer at least, and that appellant’s specific objections, as set forth in its bill of exceptions, can not be made to answer the purpose of special exceptions.
Appellant’s second, third, and fourth assignments of error complain of the action of the court below in permitting appellee to introduce in evidence the written transfer from the other shippers to him of their claim against appellant for the damages caused to them, and in permitting appellee by verbal evidence to identify the claims referred to in this transfer with the ones sued on by him. The ground of the objection to this transfer was, that the appellant’s name is given in appellee’s petition as “ The St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company in Texas,” and the transfer from these several parties was of their claims for damages against “ The St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company;” appellant claiming that this constituted a fatal variance which could not be supplied by verbal evidence. Appellee in his petition did not declare upon this written transfer, but only alleged in general terms that these several parties, for a valuable consideration, had transferred their claims to him, and the instrument complained of was offered to prove this allegation; and under the allegations in plaintiff’s petition we think he was correctly allowed to introduce any evidence that would show that he was the owner of these several claims for damage against appellant, and that this evidence could either have been wholly written, wholly verbal, or partly written and partly verbal; and we do not think the objection comes within the reason of those cases relating to variances between a written instrument declared on in the pleading and the one offered in evidence. But even if these decisions should apply, we are not prepared to hold that the variance in this case could have misled appellant, and therefore be held material. Mason v. McLaughlin, 16 Texas, 24.
Appellant’s fifth and seventh assignments of error complain of the action of the court in permitting appellee to introduce evidence of a slight delay to the train containing the cattle between Brandon and Corsicana, Texas, the delay complained of being alleged in the petition to have occurred between Kerens, Texas, and Pine Bluff, Arkansas, both points being east of Corsicana. Where the trial is before the court without a jury the admission of improper evidence is not ordinarily sufficient to require a reversal. Schleicher v. Markward, 61 Texas, 99; Andrews v. Key, 77 Texas, 35. In this case the court in its findings expressly states that this delay was not taken into consideration, and of course, under these circumstances, the admission of this evidence, even though error, would be no ground for reversal.
Appellant’s sixth assignment of error complains of the action of the court in permitting the witness E. Roberts to testify that defendant’s track at the place where the delay occurred was in bad condition, the ground of objection to this evidence being that there was no allegation of bad track in appellee’s petition. There was, however, an allegation that the delay to these cattle was caused by the negligence of appellant, and we think this evidence was admissible to show such negligence. At any rate it could only be classed as immaterial or irrelevant; and the trial being before the court without a jury, the admission of such evidence is not ground for reversal. Andrews v. Key, cited above.
Appellant’s eighth and ninth assignments of error complain of the action of the court in admitting verbal testimony to show that the terminus of appellant’s line of railway was at Cairo, Illinois, and from there to East St. Louis, the point of destination, the cattle were carried by a connecting line. This evidence was admitted as bearing upon the reasonableness of the written contract requiring appellees to give notice of their damage at the place of destination, and was admitted, in connection with other evidence, to show that appellant had no agent at the point of destination to whom the notice called for in the contract could be given. For this purpose we think the evidence was admissible. Appellant’s objection to this evidence was, that there was no allegation in appellee’s petition that appellant did not own and operate a through line to East St. Louis. Appellee did allege that appellant had no station agent nor general officer at the point of destination to whom the notice could be given. The burden, however, was upon appellant to allege and prove the reasonableness of its contract as applied to the facts of this particular case, and this evidence was properly admitted to rebut the issue upon this question.
During the transit of the cattle between Pine Bluff and Cairo, A. Roberts and E. Roberts, who were with the cattle attending to them for the shippers, signed written statements at Jonesboro and Bird’s Point to the effect that the cattle were then in good condition, and in its tenth and eleventh assignments of error appellant complains of the action of the court in permitting verbal evidence, especially from these witnesses, to supplant, contradict, and vary these written instruments. That such instruments are not to be classed as conclusive admissions, or as constituting an estoppel, we think clear. Mr. Wharton, in his work on the Law of Evidence, volume 2, section 1077, says: “ Supposing an admission is set up, not as the basis of a contract, but simply as the concession of a fact on which the opposite party relies to make his case, then the admission, as we have already seen, is not a probatio, but a levamen probationis; it does not prove a fact, in the strict sense, when offered against the declarant, but it relieves the party relying on it from proving such fact, thereby throwing the burden of disproving on the declarant. By the scholastic jurists such admissions were spoken of sometimes as half-proofs, sometimes as presumptions. With us, evidence that they were made may be admissible, either as yielding presumptions against the party charged, or as relieving (under ordinary circumstances) the party offering them from the necessity of more formal proof. At the same time it must be remembered that they are not conclusive proof of what they state; that they may be readily neutralized by proof that they were uttered in ignorance or levity or mistake; and hence that they are, at the best, to be regarded as only cumulative proof, which affords but a precarious support, and on which no party should be content to rest his case. * * * In fine, where the party seeking to prove admissions in no way altered his status in consequence of their utterance, the party making them can always prove their untruth, though not, it is said, by introducing subsequent inconsistent declarations.” Also see Irvin v. Ellis, 76 Texas, 165.
Appellant’s twelfth assignment complains that the judgment of the court is not supported by the evidence, first, because appellee and his assignors consented that the cattle need not be watered and fed at Texarkana, and are thereby estopped from claiming negligence on the part of the defendant for not feeding and watering them. We think this would be a correct statement of the law if the only delay was such as resulted in the extra time required to make the next feeding station, in the absence of negligence on the part of appellant, but it would have no application to an unusual delay caused by its negligence in not making the customary time.
Appellant in the same assignment complains that the amount of damage allowed by the court is excessive. While the amount to us seems large, yet several witnesses were permitted without objection to estimate the amount of damage caused to the cattle by the unusual delay at from $3 to $5 per head. The witness Smith was disinterested, and testified as an expert that the damage caused by this delay was at least $5 per head. Appellant had several experts upon the stand, and none of them were asked to estimate the amount of this damage. The amount allowed by the court did not reach the full limit justified by the opinions of some of the witnesses, and under the circumstances we would not be authorized to disturb the finding of the lower court when the remittitur is entered, as will hereafter be done.
In its twelfth assignment appellant also complains that the finding of the court below that the contract requiring notice was unreasonable and void can not be sustained by the evidence. As stated above, and as we have several times decided, in such cases the burden is upon the carrier, both by pleading and evidence, to establish the reasonableness of a contract of this kind as applied to the facts of the particular case. In this case it seems that the line of. appellant’s road terminated at Cairo, and it' had no officer or agent at East St. Louis, the point of destination, but it did have such officer at St. Louis, in the State of Missouri. It is not shown, either by pleading or evidence, the name of any of these officers who were in St. Louis at the time this notice was required to be given by the contract. It appears that at the time this notice should have been given the shipper’s agents in charge of the stock were not acquainted with such officers and did not know where to find them; and to have found them it would have been necessary for such agents to have crossed the Mississippi River into an adjoining State, and to have assumed the responsibility of finding and deciding as to which one of these officers was a general officer within the meaning of the contract; and under the circumstances we are not prepared to say that the court erred in concluding that the contract was unreasonable in this case. If the carrier desires to claim exemption from damages caused by it, by reason of the failure of the shipper to give notice in compliance with one of these contracts, it must furnish reasonable facilities for such notice to be given in compliance therewith; and we are not prepared to say that it would be reasonable to require a shipper to leave his stock and go to a station in another State in search of some one upon whom to serve such notice.
Delivered December 20, 1892.
Appellant also in its twelfth assignment complains that the judgment of the court can not be sustained by the evidence, because it claims that the written statements certifying that the cattle at the different places in transit were in good condition, caused it to forego making an examination into the condition of same upon their arrival at their point of destination, and was in effect a notice in writing that the stock shipped"" had been shipped in good condition, but we find nothing in the evidence to sustain the assumption that these statements had anjr such effect. We do not hold that an estoppel of this kind could not be successfully interposed if it were sustained by allegation and evidence, but we would not be authorized to assume, in -the absence of evidence, that these statements had any such effect in this case.
As stated above, appellee has filed in this court a remittitur of $5 per head for each head Of the Goodnight cattle, with interest on said amount from the date of the judgment. As this is the amount of damage per head claimed in his petition, and as the court could not have allowed any greater sum than this as the damage to said cattle, we are of opinion that this remittitur should be allowed, and that the judgment below should be reformed to correspond therewith. Railway v. Measles, 81 Texas, 474.
Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that the judgment rendered by the court below should be reformed by entering the remittitur as above indicated, and when so reformed it should be in all other respects affirmed, and it is so ordered..
Reformed and affirmed.

219102,First National Bank of Decatur v. Isaac Cloud et al.,1893-03-16,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This suit was originally brought by appellant, to recover from Eppie Robertson and G-. B. F. Maxwell certain real estate situated in Cooke County. Charles M. Stevens intervened in the suit, claiming the property in controversy. Isaac Cloud was the common source of title. The controversy turns upon the priority of the judgment and execution liens under which appellant and appellees respectively deraign title from the common source. The record contains conclusions of fact, which we adopt, with the qualification stated below.
As the judgment lien under which appellees claim is prior in time to that of appellant, its validity presents the first question for determination. This judgment was obtained by Charles M. Stevens in the Federal Court at Dallas, Texas, against Isaac Cloud and others, and the abstract, which was duly filed, recorded, and indexed in the record of abstracts of judgments of Cooke County, reads as follows:
“In the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas, at Dallas.—I, A. J. Houston, clerk of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas, at Dallas, do hereby certify, that in said court, on the 22d day of May, 1885, the plaintiff recovered judgment against the defendants, A. J. Addington, Isaac Cloud, and Z. T. Addington, for the sum of $11,589.30, all of which said judgment is yet due, with interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum from its date, in cause number 767, and styled Charles M. Stevens v. A. J. Addington et al., all of which appears from the records of said court.”
Then follows the authentication of the clerk in due form. The sole objection taken to the sufficiency of this abstract, upon which the trial court held it to be invalid, was, that it did not show the amount of costs recovered, it being made to appear by the proof that the costs taxed in that case amounted to $61.
In passing upon an abstract very similar to this one, made by the same clerk, which recited, after giving the amount of the judgment and the rate of interest, without stating the amount of the costs, that “all of which said judgment and costs is yet due and unpaid,” the Federal Supreme Court, Chief Justice Fuller delivering the opinion, in a recent case disposed of the objection raised, that it did not show the amount due thereon, by a single sentence, as follows: “ The only ground on which this abstract and index could be held insufficient was, that the names of the plaintiffs were not given in full in either abstract or index.” The ■ opinion reviews the decisions of our Supreme Court construing the judgment lien statute, and concludes that the names of all the members of a plaintiff firm need not be shown either by the abstract or index. Cooke v. Avery, U. S. Sup. Ct., decided January 23, 1893, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep., 340.
Without determining whether our courts should follow that decision in this respect, we are of opinion that it is correct in holding, that the statute is substantially, if not literally, complied with, so far as stating the amount due upon the judgment is concerned, when the abstract shows the amount for which the judgment was rendered, exclusive of costs, and the rate of interest which it bears, and states that the total amount remains due and unpaid. It seems to us, that it would at least create a lien for that amount, if not for the amount of the costs. If this conclusion be correct, it will lead to an affirmance of the judgment.
In the court’s second findings of facts, in passing upon the abstract and index of the judgment subsequently rendered and recorded against Cloud and others, under which appellant claimed, the only objection sustained was, that it was indexed under the letter B as follows: Bank, First National of Decatur. In addition to this finding, it appears from the statement of facts, that the record of this abstract did not contain the authentication of the clerk, if, indeed, the abstract itself had been certified. Without passing upon the merits of these objections, we have reached the conclusion, that if by reason of a stricter construction than we have adopted, the record of the Stevens abstract be held bad, that of the Decatur bank must for the same reason be held invalid also. If then the judgment liens be both excluded from consideration, and the rights of the parties be determined by the execution sales under which they claim respectively, the judgment must be affirmed, because the levy and sale under the Stevens judgment antedated the bank’s levy and sale.
These conclusions render the other issues raised in the case wholly immaterial, and they will therefore not be considered.
The judgment will be in all things affirmed.
Affirmed.

219237,A. W. Mixon et al. v. H. G. Symonds et al.,1893-03-16,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
Emmott Brothers, doing business at Denison, Texas, made a chattel mortgage upon their entire stock in trade to their friend, H. G. Symonds, to secure certain promissory notes held by their sister and bookkeeper, E. Louise Emmott, against them, and an attorney fee charged for the preparation of the instrument. The goods were seized under attachment process and appropriated by Waples, Platter & Co. to the payment of a debt due them from said firm. From a judgment against them and the officer who levied the writ, as well as against certain sureties, for the value of the goods, this appeal is prosecuted.
Appellants made the issue, that the mortgage had been executed with intent to hinder, delay, and defraud the creditors of' Emmott Brothers, disputing the validity and amount of the debts secured. In submitting this issue to the jury, the following, among other charges of which appellants complain, were given:
‘1 Fourth. The chattel mortgage read in evidence gave to the plaintiff the right to the control and possession of the property therein mentioned for the purposes set forth in such mortgage, unless you find and believe from the evidence that the debts mentioned in said mortgage, and to secure the payment of which the same was executed, were, either in whole or in part, simulated, false, and fictitious.
“ Fifth. A debtor in failing circumstances has the right to transfer his property to a creditor to whom such debtor owes a real, actual, valid, and subsisting debt; and such transfer will not be regarded as fraudulent, even though the creditor knew that the debtor had made the same with the intent to defraud his creditors; in other words, a debtor may convey to his creditor or to some one in trust for such creditor, even though the debtor be insolvent, property sufficient to pay off the debt of such creditor, although the creditor knows that the same is done with a fraudulent intent on the part of the debtor, and although by such transfer other creditors are not protected, provided that the creditor for whose benefit the transfer is made holds against the debtor a real, genuine indebtedness.”
That these charges were erroneous and will require a reversal of the judgment, is made apparent by the following proposition of appellants, which we believe to be sound, to-wit: “ When the pleading and the evidence fairly raise the issue as to whether a conveyance of personal property, made by an insolvent creditor in trust to secure a debt, is made for the purpose of hindering, delaying, and defrauding creditors, and the evidence tends to show participation in the fraud on the part of the secured creditor, any charge which makes the validity of the instrument depend solely upon whether or not the claim secured is a bona fide debt is error.”
If the doctrine announced in the charge be the law, then may a failing debtor who has embarked in business on the borrowed capital of a relative, as seems to be claimed in this case, be enabled to steer clear of the ordinary perils of business by making a conveyance of his stock in trade to a friend to secure the debt of the relative, and at the same time tp fraudulently hinder and delay other creditors till their debts can be compromised, or the business enterprise be renewed in some other name. While it may be both kind and natural for a sister to aid a brother in this way, it is not believed to be the law.
But for the fact that the appellants in the manner of pleading seem to have assumed the burden of proof on the issue as to the validity of the alleged debts, the second paragraph of the charge might require a reversal of the judgment. Tillman v. Heller, 78 Texas, 597.
On account of the error announced in the fourth and fifth charges and applied in subsequent portions of the charge, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.

219122,M. A. Linam et al. v. R. B. Anderson et al.,1893-03-16,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This suit involves the title to the north quarter of the Patrick Rock league and labor survey of land, situated in Denton County. The land was patented to Patrick Rock in the year 1856, by virtue of a location made long prior thereto, Patrick Rock himself having died prior to 1848. He left surviving, his widow, Margaret Rock, who died in the year 1866, and three daughters, all of whom were dead at the institution of this suit. 1-Ie seems also to have left a son, who died at an early day, unmarried and without issue. Edmund Lee married one of these daughters, one Coward married another, and one Mason the third. Plaintiffs in error claim as the heirs of the wives of Lee and Coward, and the defendants claim under mesne conveyances from Mason and wife. The south half of this league seems to have passed into the hands of the locator, and there is no controversy about it.
Nearly thirty years before the trial in the court below, according to the contention of all the parties, there was a paroi partition of the north half of the survey. The controversy arises upon the manner and extent of this partition. The theory of plaintiffs in error is, that the scope of the partition was limited to the undivided half-interest inherited by the three daughters from Patrick Rock, and that this undivided half-interest was divided equally between them, they taking the south half of the north half, and the surviving widow taking the land in controversy, to-wit, the north half of the north half. The theory of defendants in error is, that this verbal partition extended to the whole of the north half, and that the land in controversy was set apart to the wife of Mason and the surviving widow, to become the property of the former upon the death of the latter, and that the south half of the north half was divided equally between the other two daughters.
A deed was read in evidence, without objection, bearing date 21st day of March, 1861, from Margaret Rock to her daughter Mary, the wife of Coward, conveying by metes and bounds a strip of 375 acres running east and west across the south half of the north half of the survey, and adjacent to the south boundary line of the north quarter. A bond for title was also read in evidence, executed in 1859 by Lee and Coward to G-. W. Lawler and George Wright, conveying a strip of 400 acres off the south side of the north half of the survey, leaving a strip of 375 acres between the land described in the Coward deed and in the Wright and Lawler bond, for which no conveyance seems to have been read in evidence, though it was in proof that Lee and wife had conveyed this land to other parties many years ago.
Upon the back of the deed from Margaret Kock to Mary Coward was found a diagram, which indicated that the north half of the survey had been divided into four strips, running east and west; the south strip having written upon it “ George Wright and G. W. Lawler 400 acres;” the next strip north having written upon it “ Edmund Lee 375^^ acres;” and the next, 11 Mary Coward 375^^ acres;” and the last, “Margaret Eock 957-Aíj- acres;” and out of the northeast corner of this strip was cut a strip marked “ W. G. Nelson 200 acres.” Eunning across all these strips from north to south, near the east boundary, was an endorsement “ 2000 varas;” and across the three strips marked “ Wright and Lawler,” “ Edmund Lee,” and “Mary Coward,” an endorsement “1000 varas.”
Plaintiffs in error objected to the introduction of this plat in evidence, and assign error upon its admission. The ground of objection, as set forth in their first proposition under the first assignment of error, was, that its execution had not been proven. This objection’S amplified in the proposition with the statement that it did not constitute the basis, in whole or in part, of the pleadings in the case; and it had not been shown by whom it was made, nor by what authority it was placed on the back of the deed. The bill of exceptions was approved with this explanation, viz.: “It is apparent from a comparison of the handwritings that said deed and plat were written by the same person, and they seem to be of the same age.”
It has been held in this State, that the execution of a lost deed may be proven by circumstantial evidence. Crain v. Huntington, 81 Texas, 614, and case there cited. In view of the age of the deed, its evident genuineness, the death of all the parties, and the fact of a contemporaneous partition of some kind made by the parties, we think the evidence of identity in handwriting and age of the deed and plat tended sufficiently to show that the plat must have been the work of the parties to the deed to admit it in evidence, especially as it was not in conflict with the deed, but in explanation of it. Plaintiffs in error,- by requesting appropriate instructions, might perhaps have had this issue passed upon by the jury and the scope of the evidence limited, but nothing of this sort seems to have been done. This disposes of the first assignment of error.
By the third subdivision of the charge, defendants’ theory of paroi partition was submitted to the jury, and the verdict indicates that they found for defendants in error under that subdivision of the charge. Error is assigned upon the giving of this charge, on the ground, as submitted by the plaintiffs’ proposition under the assignment, that there was not sufficient evidence to fairly raise the issue of fact to which it relates. No objection is taken to the validity or legal effect of the kind of partition submitted by the charge and passed upon by the jury.
By the third assignment, plaintiffs in error complain of the insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict. It thus appears that these two assignments raise substantially the same question. We have carefully considered the statement of facts: and in view of the long lapse of time; of the inherent difficulty, therefore, of making clear proof of the exact manner of the paroi partition; of the fact that the deed and title bond mentioned above were inconsistent with plaintiff’s theory of the partition; of the further fact, that for nearly thirty years the defendants in error and those under whom they claim seem to have acted upon a theory of partition which excluded all interest in plaintiffs in error; and of the conduct of plaintiffs’ ancestors in disposing of the lands allotted to them in the partition, and not asserting title to any other portion of said survey until after so great a lapse of time, we have reached the conclusion, that the settlement of this controversy by the verdict of the jury should not be disturbed.
Believing the testimony, under the circumstances, to be sufficient to support the verdict, and there being no other questions submitted for our determination, we are brought to the conclusion that the judgment must be in all things affirmed.
Affirmed.

216185,R. M. Greer v. Richardson Drug Company,1892-12-20,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
It seems that on the 23d day of July, 1888, E. G. Puckett executed a deed of trust on a stock of drugs to appellant as trustee, to secure a debt due by him to Behrens & Castles, of Waco, Texas, amounting to the sum of $312.83, with interest from July 21, 1888, at 12 per cent per annum. By the terms of said deed in trust the trustee was empowered to at once take sole and exclusive charge and possession of said property, to the exclusion of the mortgagor and all other persons, and the same sell for cash with all reasonable dispatch, at the usual selling market price thereof, and the proceeds of sale were to be applied, first, to the payment of a reasonable compensation to himself for his services in conducting said sale at the rate of $25 per month; second, to the payment and discharge of all accrued and accruing rents of the store house in which said goods were situated or might thereafter be situated; third, to the payment of the debt to Behrens & Castles; and as soon as all of said indebtedness was paid off, such deed of trust and all therein contained was to become null and void; but if within six months from the date thereof said trustee had not in the manner aforesaid fully paid off and discharged said indebtedness, then said trustee should advertise all of said property for ten days, by posting three written notices of sale at three public places in Hill County, Texas, and sell the same at the court house door in Whitney, where said goods were then situated, at public vendue to the highest bidder for cash, and with the proceeds of sale pay such indebtedness in the order above named; and it was further stipulated that the residue, if any, should be paid over to the mortgagor or his heirs and assigns.
On the 10th day of August, 1888, and before the debt to Behrens & Castles had been satisfied, appellee sued out, in the County Court of Hill County, a writ of attachment against Puckett for the sum of $279.80, and had the same levied upon the stock of drugs conveyed to appellant as aforesaid. Appellant filed his claim bond, and this suit is for the trial of the rights of property thereon. The issues tendered raised the question as to the validity of said deed in trust, plaintiffs alleging that it had been made in fraud of the creditors of Puckett. On the trial of the case in the court below the claimant offered in evidence the deed in trust from Puckett to him, to which plaintiff objected, for the reason that “ it showed on its face that it was void as to creditors, in so much as it directed the trustee, Greer, to pay to the mortgagor all of the proceeds of the sale of the goods left in his hands after the satisfaction of the claims set out in said trust deed.” In the bill of exceptions it is recited, that “ the court sustained the objection of- plaintiff without evidence, subject, however, to a determination of the issue of the solvency or insolvency of E. G. Puckett at the time of the making of the trust deed; holding that in case the evidence showed that E. G. Puckett was solvent at said time the instrument would be admitted, otherwise it would be excluded; and further holding the burden of proof was upon the defendant to show the solvency of said Puckett at said time.” It may be added here that the deed in trust contained no recital as to the solvency or insolvency of Puckett.
Appellant’s first assignment of error calls in question the correctness of the ruling of the court upon the introduction of the deed of trust as above set forth, and we are of opinion that the specific objection made to the introduction of this deed, as shown by the bill of exceptions, was not well taken. It will be noticed that the only objection made to the deed was that it provided for the return of the surplus, after satisfying the debts it was made to secure, to the mortgagor, and this we think was entirely proper, and is the distinguishing feature between such an instrument and an assignment. If it was only intended that this instrument should have the effect of a mortgage, the provision complained of was proper, whether Puckett was solvent or insolvent. Johnson v. Robinson & Co., 68 Texas, 399.
The propositions presented by appellant, however, under this assignment seem to raise the question as to the validity of this deed in trust, had other objections been made to it; and as the case must be reversed upon grounds hereafter stated, we think it best to indicate our opinion as to the validity of the deed upon the grounds discussed in the briefs. We are of opinion, if Puckett was insolvent at the time this deed in trust was made, the provision empowering the trustee to hold possession of the goods for six months, during which time he was only authorized to sell at the usual selling market price, in connection with the great excess in the value of the goods conveyed above the debts secured, would make the deed fraudulentas to the other creditors of Puckett, who would thereby be unreasonably delayed. Gallagher v. Goldfrank, 75 Texas, 562; Gregg & Son v. Cleveland & Co., 82 Texas, 187. Where property is thus placed by an insolvent debtor in the hands of a trustee, so that his other creditors can not obtain possession thereof by means of the ordinary process for the collection of their debts, the deed must not be such as will prevent the trustee from promptly disposing of the property to pay the debt it is given to secure, and we are of opinion that an attempt by such a debtor to prevent the sale of his property for six months at other than the usual market price would of necessity be to delay and hinder his other creditors.
Appellant’s second assignment of error complains of the action of the court in imposing upon him the burden of proving that Puckett was solvent at the time of the execution of the deed in trust, and we are of opinion that this assignment is well taken. It was the appellee who alleged the insolvency of Puckett and attacked the deed as being fraudulent for this reason, and we think it clear the burden was upon it to establish this fact; for if the deed upon its face was good if made by one who was solvent, but bad if made by an insolvent, certainly the presumption would be in favor of the validity of the instrument, and the burden would be upon the one alleging its invalidity.
Upon the trial in the court below, appellee, for the purpose of showing that Puckett was not the owner of a certain piece of land upon which was a mill and gin, was allowed to introduce the tax rolls to show that he did not render it for taxes, and appellant’s third assignment complains of the admission of this evidence over his objection, and we are of opinion that this assignment is well taken. Appellee did not introduce the original assessment list signed by Puckett, but only the tax rolls, and we are of opinion that this could not be used as a statement made by Puckett as to his financial condition. Randidge v. Lyman, 124 Mass., 361; Adams & Co. v. Hickox, 55 Iowa, 632.
Upon the trial in the court below, appellee was allowed to introduce in evidence the record of a deed from E. G-. Puckett to E. C. Puckett, conveying the land with the mill and gin thereon, referred to above, to which appellant objected because no predicate was laid for its introduction, and his fourth assignment of error complains of the action of the court in admitting this evidence, and we are of opinion that this assignment is well taken. The record- of the deed at most could only have been admitted as secondary evidence under the objection made by appellant, and it is not made to appear that E. C. Puckett, who should have possession of this deed, was beyond the jurisdiction of the court, or that appellee could not for any other reason have obtained the original. We think it clear that appellant’s objection to the record as secondary evidence should have been sustained. Where an instrument in writing which a party desires to use in evidence is in the possession of a third party, he must either have it produced under a subpoena duces tecum or show that it is beyond his power to produce it in some other way, before he will be allowed to introduce secondary evidence of its contents: Hall v. York, 16 Texas, 18. The fact desired to be proven by the introduction of this deed was the actual conveyance of the land by Puckett, and to thereby show that he was not the owner thereof at the time of the execution of the deed in trust, and for this purpose we think it clear that the deed itself was the best evidence. 1 Wliart. Law of Ev., sec. 61.
By the fifth assignment of error the appellant attacks the validity of the attachment levied by appellee on the goods, on the ground that the petition filed by appellee at the time of suing out this attachment showed that the court had no jurisdiction of the case. The petition in this attachment case alleged that the plaintiff ""sold to the defendant (Puckett) goods, etc., to the amount of S279.80, and that defendant failed to pay said sum, except the sum of-dollars, paid on the-day of-, 188 — , to plaintiff’s damage §100, etc. The affidavit for attachment and the writ, however, both show the indebtedness to be §279.80, and thereafter the appellee, by leave of the court, amended its petition and showed the indebtedness to be for the same amount, and judgment was rendered for this amount upon this amended petition. Appellant’s contention is that the original petition only claimed an indebtedness of §100 at the time the attachment was issued, and the County Court had no jurisdiction of the case, and the petition could not be thereafter amended so as to support an attachment issued in a case without jurisdiction. Without deciding that the construction placed by appellant upon the original petition is the correct one, we are of opinion that the amendment cured any objection that might have been urged to it. It will be noted that the amendment was of the petition, and not of the affidavit or writ of attachment. That this can be done so as to support the attachment, we consider settled by the decisions of our Supreme Court. Tarkinton v. Broussard, 51 Texas, 550; Marx & Kempner v. Abramson, 58 Texas, 264; McDannell v. Cherry, 64 Texas; 177; Ward v. Lathrop, 11 Texas, 287.

216255,John P. Cox et al. v. W. H. Trent,1892-12-20,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This suit was instituted by W. H. Trent against Casey & Swasey, as attaching creditors of G-. W. Benton, and against John P. Cox, the officer who executed the attachment by seizing and selling the stock in trade of a small retail liquor store in Hill County. Trent’s title depended upon the validity of a transfer made to him by said Benton, through his manager, J. F. Etchison, made only a few days before the attachment was levied, December 28, 1888. Appellants attacked this conveyance for fraud. Trent had been clerking for Etchison or Benton for about thirteen months, as he testified, .before he made the purchase, and claimed that the consideration was wages due him for that period of time at the rate of B40 per month, and also some money loaned during that time and partly used in the business. He filed his suit on the first day of January, 1889, and in addition to the value of the goods converted, claimed damages for the conversion of the unexpired occupation tax license, which he claimed was also sold to him as a part of the saloon assets.
Much stress is laid in the briefs of counsel on the point that the suit was filed on a legal holiday. This objection appellants seek to avail themselves of under a general demurrer and motion in arrest of judgment; but this, in our opinion, they can not do. Nothing short of a special exception, promptly made and urged, will reach such a defect. Williams & Co. v. Verne, 68 Texas, 414.
The seventh, eighth, and ninth assignments of error relate to the exclusion of certain letters and other evidence tending to show, slightly though it may be, that the conveyance of the property in question was not made in entire good faith in consideration of a debt of unquestioned validity. These letters were written by appellee in the name of and for Etchison, as the manager of the saloon, to Casey & Swasey, in October, 1887, and March, 1888, and tended to show that the debt which appellee claims was then accruing, and afterward became the consideration for the transfer, was in fact not accruing, or, if accruing, that its existence was thereby attempted to be concealed from Casey & Swasey in order to obtain an extension and increase of credit. It seems clear to us that this testimony was admissible on the issue of fraud, and that these assignments are well taken. In transactions of this kind, where the failing debtor sells out to his hireling, and fraud is alleged, the fullest latitude of proof should be allowed. Every relevant circumstance of a feather’s weight should go to the jury for what it is worth.
The sixth assignment complains of the admission in evidence of the bill of sale under which appellee deraigns title, for the purpose of showing thereby a transfer of the occupation tax license, on the ground that the statute provides for the transfer on the books of the officer who issued it. We are not prepared to say that appellants could insist that no right passed by the voluntary act of the parties without a compliance with the formalities prescribed by law. We are, however, of opinion that appellee was not entitled to recover of appellants the value of the license on account of the alleged conversion thereof by its seizure and sale under attachment. The law inhibits a second transfer. If, therefore, the title passed by the bill of sale, appellee was not deprived of his title by the sale under attachment. If no title passed by the bill of sale, appellee lost nothing by the seizure and sale of the license. Then, in the absence of allegation and proof of damages resulting specially from the seizure of the stock of goods and consequent interruption of the business, we are of opinion that the value of the license should not be submitted to the jury as the measure of damages for the alleged conversion thereof.
Delivered December 20, 1892.
The other assignments of error are not well taken.
For the errors above indicated, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.
Reversed and remanded.

216206,The Texas Central Railway Company v. Sallie G. Stuart,1892-12-22,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On the 19th day of January, 1883, Sallie G. Stuart, then a minor about three years of age, with her mother and younger sister, were passengers in a regular passenger train of plaintiff in error, going from Cisco to section house No. 19 on its line of railroad in this State. At the town of Corban, a station on said railroad a short distance from defendant in error’s destination, the train upon which she was riding was stopped and the locomotive detached therefrom and sent off on other business. When the locomotive was again coupled to the cars this was done so negligently as to cause a collision of sufficient force to throw defendant in error from the seat upon which she was sitting against the stove in the car, from which she received a cut of considerable length over one of her eyes, and also a concussion of her back from which serious injuries to her kidneys afterwards resulted. At the time of the collision between the locomotive and the cars, defendant in error, with her mother, was sitting on the seat immediately fronting the stove, the day being cold.
This suit was filed by defendant in error, suing by her next friend, A. J. Stuart, against plaintiff in error, October 24, 1883, to recover damages for the personal injuries inflicted as aforesaid.
The amount of damage alleged to have been caused from the injury to the head is $3000, and that alleged to have been caused from the injury to the back is $7000. A trial on December 17, 1886, resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the defendant in error for $1000 for the injuries to the head and $4000 for the injuries to the back, and from this judgment this writ of error is prosecuted.
In its charge to the jury the court, in its statement of the nature of the suit, used this language: “Plaintiff brings this suit by her next friend against defendant in the sum of $10,000, for certain alleged personal injuries.” Also the court, in the eighth paragraph of the charge, used the following language: “ If you find for the plaintiff, the form of your verdict will be: We, the jury, find for the plaintiff and assess her damages, first, for the injuries to her head and consequent suffering therefrom in the sum of-- dollars (filling up the blank with the amount assessed, which must in no event exceed $3000); second, for the injuries to plaintiff’s back and consequent suffering, we assess the damages in the sum of -dollars (filling up the blank with the amount found, which must in no event exceed $7000). If you find for defendant, you will simply so say.” And plaintiff in error in its first assignment complains that this reference by the court in its charge to the amount sued for by defendant in error operated to its prejudice. We do not think the amount claimed in the petition was given sufficient prominence in the charge to operate to the prejudice of the plaintiff in error. Railway v. Burnett, 80 Texas, 538.
In its second assignment plaintiff in error claims that the court erred in instructing the jury “ that the law requires the defendant to take great care in the management of its trains. ’ ’ In the case of Railway v. Burnett, cited above, a charge that carriers of passengers by rail are required to use the highest degree of care for their safety was, as we think, correctly approved, and we are clearly of the opinion that the degree of care exacted by the charge of the court in this case was not higher than .that imposed by law.
In its third assignment plaintiff in error complains of this charge of the court, to-wit: “In order to defend from liability on account of alleged contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff or her mother, the burden of proof is on defendant to satisfy you of such contributory negligence under the law as herein defined.” We believe that the use of the word “satisfy” in this paragraph of the charge was error, and that to sustain the defense of contributory negligence no more than a preponderance of the evidence upon that point is required. McBride v. Banguss, 65 Texas, 177. But an examination of the record satisfies us that there was no evidence raising the issue of contributory negligence, and that no charge upon this subject should have been given. The only evidence we find in the record upon this point is the uncontradicted fact that defendant in error was sitting on a seat next the stove, by the side of her mother, and if it be conceded that a child 3 years old could in any case be chargeable with contributory negligence (which we do not wish to be understood as conceding), or if it be conceded that negligence of the parent would be imputed to the child under the circumstances of this case, which in this State is at least doubtful (Railway v. Moore, 59 Texas, 67), we are clearly of the opinion that it is no negligence for a mother in charge of a 3-year old child to occupy the seat in the car nearest the stove on a cold day, when this is necessary for their comfort.
We have examined plaintiff in error’s fourth assignment and the several propositions thereunder, and are satisfied that there is nothing in the numerous objections therein made of which it can justly complain, and no useful purpose could be subserved in their discussion.
The fifth assignment of error complains of the form of the verdict the jury were required by the charge of the court to adopt in case they found in favor of the plaintiff, the contention being, that the form of this verdict required the jury to find damages both for the alleged injuries to the head and to the back, when the evidence would have authorized a finding that there was no injury to the back. The form of the verdict required by the charge of the court is quoted above, and if this were all that is said in the charge upon the subject it would raise quite a serious question. We believe, however, that taking the whole paragraph of the charge together, there is no reasonable probability that the jury could have been misled in allowing damages under either head which were not caused by negligence on the part of the plaintiff in error. The paragraph in which this form of the verdict is given is as follows: “And in this connection you are charged that the liability, if any, of defendant is measured by the fact that the injury received, if any, follows approximate^ from its culpable act, if any; and if you believe from the evidence that after such injuries, if any, were received by Sallie G. Stuart, she suffered from any malady or disease, then, unless you believe from the evidence that such malady or disease proximately resulted from the injuries negligently inflicted upon her by defendant, you can not consider such malady or disease or the damages or suffering springing from such disease or malady in estimating the damages. If you find any damages for plaintiff, you can only find damages in such sum as will compensate her for the injuries, if any, directly inflicted upon her by the negligent act of defendant and following approximately from such injuries. If you find for plaintiff, the form of your verdict will be,” etc. Then follows the form of the verdict complained of.
We think there is no reasonable doubt but that the jury, construing the whole charge together, understood that they were only to allow such damages as were caused by the acts of the plaintiff in error, and that they were not misled by the form of verdict prescribed by the court into allowing any damages they otherwise would not have allowed. At the same time, we do not wish to be understood as approving the language used by the court in prescribing this form for the verdict, without also informing the jury that they might find damages for one of the alleged injuries without also finding for the other, and were there any reasonable ground disclosed by the record to believe that the jury could have been misled thereby, we would feel bound to reverse the case.
The seventh and eighth assignments of error call in question the action of the court in'refusing two special charges requested by plaintiff in error, to the effect that if the jury believed the injury to defendant in error’s kidneys resulted from the injury to her head, and not from the injury to her back, they should notallow any damages on account of such injuries. This is based upon the contention that defendant in error in her petition alleges the injuries to her kidneys to have resulted from the injury to her back, but we do not so construe the petition. The allegation relied upon is in this language: “That by said fall plaintiff’s back was seriously bruised and wrenched, by reason of which plaintiff suffered great and excruciating pain for many days and nights, to-wit, one hundred; her kidneys were seriously and permanently injured, and her lower limbs were paralyzed, and other injuries then and there done and resulting as aforesaid.” We construe this petition as alleging that the injury to the kidneys resulted from the fall, just as the injury to the back resulted from the fall, and not that the injury to the kidneys necessarily resulted from the injury to the back; at least we think the petition is subject to this construction, and plaintiff in error not having specifically excepted to it, we think it should not now be allowed to complain. It is. not a case in which the rule that a pleading is to be construed most strongly against the pleader should be applied.
The ninth assignment of error complains of the action of the court in having expressed in the hearing of the jury a doubt as to the admissibility of a report made by certain physicians appointed by the court to examine defendant in error, and the tenth assignment of error complains at the action of the court in expressing in the hearing of the jury a doubt as to whether there was sufficient evidence as to contributory negligence on the part of the mother to authorize a submission of this issue. The language used by the court below was such as occurs in almost every trial, and we think could have been expressed in both instances in much stronger language than was used, without giving plaintiff in error any just cause of complaint. The court’s doubt as to the admissibility of the report of the physicians must have been a very serious one, and we have already held that there was no contributory negligence in the case.
The eleventh assignment of error calls in question'the action of the court in overruling a motion for a new trial, upon the ground that the juror Shoate was not an impartial juror, as shown by the fact that upon one occasion at his boarding house, during one of the recesses of the court while the trial was in progress, when it was said in his presence that the jury had made up their minds on hearing the first witness, he replied, “ Yes, the railways should be pulled (or made to pay money, or some language of equivalent import) when there is a chance at them.” The fact that this juror used this language was shown by the affidavit of one H. C. Duke. At the hearing of this motion the affidavits of John Browning, W. B. Stanfield, and Billy Bearden, who were in a position to have heard this language of the juror had it been uttered, were read, and neither of them heard any such expression. After the hearing of this evidence the court proposed to withhold its ruling until the evidence of the juror himself could be obtained, but both parties expressed a willingness to submit the question upon the affidavits introduced, and the court upon this evidence overruled the motion, thereby holding that the affidavit of the witness Duke was not true in fact. If it be conceded that the motion upon its face, accompanied with Duke’s affidavit, was sufficient to authorize the granting of a new trial, which we do not decide, we think it clear that the finding of the court was amply sustained by the evidence before it.
The twelfth assignment of error complains of the action of the court in refusing a new trial on the ground that the verdict is contrary .to the evidence and is excessive, but we are satisfied that the verdict is amply supported by the evidence in all respects.
The fourteenth assignment of error complains that the judgment should have been rendered in favor of A. J. Stuart as next friend of Sallie G-. Stuart, instead of directly in favor of the minor herself. We are of the opinion that the proper form of judgment in such cases is to recite that the plaintiff by her next friend, naming them, do have and recover the amount of the judgment for the sole use of the minor, and that the judgment should also recite that the money when collected is to remain in court until the qualification of a regular guardian or the minor reaches her majority, and the judgment in this case will be reformed to so read. Railway v. Styron, 66 Texas, 424; Brooke v. Clark, 57 Texas, 112.
A supplementary assignment of error filed by plaintiff in error calls in question the action of the court in submitting to the jury separately the question of damages to the head and back, and requiring a finding as to each. While we do not approve of this practice, we see no evidence of any injury having resulted in this case to plaintiff in error of which it can complain.
Upon the whole case, we are of the opinion that the judgment in favor of the defendant in error should be reformed as above indicated, and when so reformed should in all things be affirmed, and that the costs of this appeal should be paid by plaintiff in error.
Reformed and affirmed.

219178,J. M. Curtis et al. v. W. H. Wilson et al.,1892-12-06,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
J. M.Curtis and Dortha E. Swain, appellants, brought this suit of trespass to try title, January 13, 1886, in the District Court of Parker County, to recover certain realty, together with the improvements thereon, situated in the city of Weatherford. At the time of the trial, W. H. Wilson, George A. McCall, L. W. Christian, Jennie Christian, and Jim L. McCall, a minor, through his guardian ad litem, George A. McCall, were defendants.
Among other matters, the defendants relied upon the pleas of not guilty, of the statute of ten years limitation, and of improvements in good faith. A trial by jury on May 22, 1889, resulted in a verdict for the defendants, and a judgment accordingly, from which this appeal is-prosecuted.
As a counter-proposition to all the assignments of error, appellees contend that they were entitled to a verdict under their plea .of not guilty. They assert, that the plaintiffs failed to show title from the State, and that it nowhere appears that the parties claimed under a common source. The appellants do not deraign title from the sovereignty The source of their title is a deed from William M. Green to John W. Curtis, executed in 1857. It is undisputed that the appellants are the children and heirs at law of said Curtis.
In their plea setting up improvements in good faith, appellees alleged, that they claim under one Jane L. Sikes, and that in the year 1859 John W. Curtis died and willed to Jane L. Sikes the property in controversy. It is thus apparent that both appellants and appellees claim under Curtis, and consequently under the deed from Green, and that this contention of appellees can not be sustained.
A very material, perhaps” the controlling, issue in the case arose out of the plea of limitation. It was proved by numerous witnesses for the appellees that Mi'S. Jane L. Sikes, under whom they claim, occupied continuously and enjoyed the property in controversy, claiming it in her own separate right, for a period beginning as early as 1859, and ending at the date of her death in August, 1885. Such being the state of the evidence for the defendants, the plaintiff J. M. Curtis offered to prove by his own deposition that he was in Weatherford in 1877, and then had frequent conversations about the property in controversy, in which conversations Mrs. Sikes stated, that “ the property was purchased by John W. Curtis, plaintiff’s father, and with his own money; that she had been advised by attorneys that she could hold it during her lifetime, but that at her death she would as soon the plaintiffs would have it as any one; that she only claimed a life-estate in the property.” To the statements made by Mrs. Sikes in these conversations, appellees objected, “ because the declarations purported to have been made by her through whom defendants claim, and the witness was a party to the suit brought against a part of the defendants, who were the legatees of Jane L. Sikes.”
Appellants assign as error the action of the court in sustaining this objection and excluding the evidence. The objection is predicated upon article 2248 of the Revised Statutes, which reads as follows: “ In actions by or against executors, administrators, or guardians, in which judgment may be rendered for or against them as such, neither party shall be allowed to testify against the others as to any transaction with or statement by the testator, intestate, or ward, unless called to testify thereto by the opposite party; and the provisions of this article shall extend to and include all actions by or against the heirs or legal representatives of a decedent arising out of any transaction with such decedent.”
It has been held that the language of this article can not be so interpreted as to include “legatees.” Persons of this character do not come within the designation “ executors, administrators, guardians, heirs, or legal representatives.” The language of the statute will not by implication be extended to include persons of a class not designated therein. Newton v. Newton, 77 Texas, 511; Mitchell v. Mitchell, 80 Texas, 111. The specific objection, not referring to any of the persons named in the statute, but to legatees, was erroneously sustained, and bearing as it did upon a material issue in this case, requires a reversal of the judgment.
The plaintiffs having dismissed their suit against Jim L. McCall and Jennie Christian, the court did not err in permitting the remaining defendants, on such dismissal, to make the parties named defendants in the cause. This action was in the discretion of the court, as the additional parties claimed an interest in the property. Rev. Stats., art. 1209.
Nor did the court err in admitting the declarations of Jane L. Sikes showing the character of her claim, and that her possession was adverse. These declarations, contemporaneous with her possession and explanatory thereof, were admitted, with the limitations by the court, that they were not to be considered as evidence of title, but solely for the purpose stated. For this purpose they were clearly competent. Harnage v. Berry, 43 Texas, 567.
The paper purporting to be the will of Mrs. Turner, formerly Mrs. Sikes, having been stricken from the record by an order of our Supreme Court, the questions relating thereto and stated in appellants’ brief will not be considered by us. We find no merit in the remaining assignments of appellants, save in so far as the questions arising out of them may be affected by the error already pointed out, and on account of which the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.

216182,Sarah M. McWhirter et al. v. S. B. Allen et al.,1892-12-20,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This controversy, as here presented, involves an issue between the appellants, Sarah M. McWhirter and others, and the appellees, S. B. Allen and others, with reference to the title to a tract of 13 labors of land lying three and a half miles northwest from the town of Bonham, in Fannin County. The suit, brought by appellants, is in the nature of an action of trespass to try title. Plaintiffs seek to remove an alleged cloud from their title by the cancellation of 'patent No. 474, volume 19, for 13 labors or 13,000,000 square varas of land, issued to Washington S. McClure, assignee of G. W. King, July 5, 1873, and to be restored to their alleged rights under patent No. 468, volume 19, issued to William S. Grace, as assignee of G. W. King, June 30, 1873.
Appellants claim as heirs of William S. Grace; appellees as vendees, by mesne conveyances, of Washington S. McClure. All the parties claim under a certificate in the name of G. W. King for 26 labors of land.
1. The land in controversy is a part of a survey located by virtue of certificate No. 661, issued to G. W. King, for 26,000,000 square varas of land, on July 6, 1838.
2. January 18, 1839, G. W. King transferred one-half of this certificate to John McClure. February 20, 1839, McClure transferred this half to W. S. Grace. July 7, 1839, Grace located his portion of the certificate on a tract of land in Red River County, Texas.
3. November 28, 1838, G. W. King located his portion of the certificate on another tract of land in Red River County.
4. W. S. Grace died in the year 1840, and plaintiffs and appellants are his only heirs.
5. After the location by Grace of his portion of the certificate on the tract in Red River County, the location was lifted, and his portion of the certificate was, on January 15, 1844, relocated on a tract of land lying on Pilot Grove Creek, now in Collin County.
6. After the location by King of his portion of the certificate on the tract in Red River County, his location was lifted, and on January 15, 1847, it was relocated on the land in controversy.
7. .November 23, 1848, G. W. King transferred his portion of the certificate, with its location, to W. S. McClure.
8. June 30, 1873, Jacob Keuchler, Commissioner of the General Land Office, issued a patent for the survey, including the land in suit, to W. S. Grace. This patent was never delivered to any one. It was retained in the office by the Commissioner, who, on July 3, 1873, wrote across its face the following words: “ Cancelled, July 3, 1873, having issued to the wrong assignee. Jacob Keuchler, Commissioner,”
9. July 5, 1873, the Commissioner issued to W„ S. McClure a patent for the above mentioned survey, and appellees herein hold by mesne conveyances under McClure.
We do not concur with appellants that the court erred in overruling their objection to the transfer from G. W. King to Washington S. McClure. This objection was two-fold:
1. The transfer was void in failing to sufficiently describe the land conveyed.
2. The transfer showed upon its face that the words ‘ ‘ the survey lying between Bois d’Arc and Caney, Fannin County,” were fraudulently interpolated after the transfer was executed and delivered; this being apparent from the fact that these words were written in black ink, while the remainder of the instrument was wholly in blue ink.
The property is described in the transfer substantially as follows: “One-half, or 13 labors of land, of the headlight certificate of the grantor, George W. King, to one league and labor of land, No. 661, first class, issued by the Board of Land Commissioners for Red River County, Republic of Texas; the survey lying between Bois d’Arc and Caney, Fannin County, Texas.”
Any uncertainty as to the identity of the land conveyed by this instrument could, it is evident, be explained by extrinsic testimony, and the deed was not void for want of description. Kingston v. Pickins, 46 Texas, 99; Wilson v. Smith, 50 Texas, 365; Brown v. Chambers, 63 Texas, 131; Overand v. Menczer, 83 Texas, 122.
As to the second objection: The transfer bears date November 23, 1848. It appears to have been recorded in Fannin County, June 7, 1853, and to have been filed in the Land Office August 22, 1853. These facts, we think, authorized the admission of the transfer in evidence as an ancient instrument, though an affidavit had been made impeaching its genuineness. The fact of the insertion or interpolation, and the date and intention thereof, were questions for the consideration of the jury. Brown v. Simpson’s Heirs, 67 Texas, 225; Parker v. Chancellor, 73 Texas, 475; Rodriguez v. Haynes, 76 Texas, 225.
There are several other assignments of error. We are not required to state them or to consider them consecutively. They are founded principally upon two propositions:
1. When the patent No. 468, dated June 30, 1873, in favor of Wm., S. Grace, was signed by the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the Governor, it was thereby issued; delivery was not essential to make it effective, and it was not in the power of the Commissioner to cancel it, though his signature had been affixed to it by mistake.
2. The patent so issued was in and of itself such evidence of title as to render it improper in the court to charge the jury with reference to the question, “ Who first appropriated the land by valid survey, the plaintiffs, claiming as the heirs of Grace, or the defendants, claiming as vendees of McClure?”
Waiving consideration of the former of these propositions, we are clearly of the opinion that the view suggesting the latter is erroneous. This error pervades quite generally appellants’ assignments. In fact, it constitutes the burden of their contention. If, as a matter of fact, the land in controversy was appropriated by a valid location and survey made for McClure, and the patent for the land was afterwards issued and delivered to Grace, he would thereby acquire no title. The patent could confer no right upon Grace to lands previously appropriated by McClure. The patent thus issued to Grace would be invalid. Sherwood v. Fleming, 25 Texas Supp., 409; Wyllie v. Wynne, 26 Texas, 43.
The plaintiffs requested two special instructions, and assign their rejection as error. The first of these instructions contains the proposition that the burden rested upon the defendants to show, in the event the patent was issued to Grace, that it was issued wrongfully. As a patent on its face is evidence of title in the patentee, it follows that it would devolve upon one claiming adversely to it to show that it was issued without authority. The proposition referred to might therefore require consideration from us but for the fact that it is connected in the requested charge with propositions distinct in character, and which, in our opinion, it would have been improper in the court to submit to the jury. The action of the court under such circumstances in rejecting the entire instruction does not afford cause of complaint. Hamburg v. Wood & Co., 66 Texas, 176.
The court, in a charge which impresses us as apposite and impartial, correctly referred to the jury, as a test whereby to determine the rights of the parties, the question, “ Who, by valid location, first appropriated the land in controversy?” This question the jury, under evidence warranting their action, answered in favor of the appellees. We are not authorized to disturb their verdict; and the judgment is therefore affirmed.

219188,"The Sulphur Springs & Mount Pleasant Railway Company v. The St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company in Texas",1893-01-10,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On November 22, 1889, appellant filed-its third amended original petition in the form of an action of trespass to try title, but specially pleading the facts relied upon by it, to recover from appellee the title and possession of the right of way upon which is located the line of railway now in the possession of and operated by appellee between Sulphur Springs and Mount Pleasant, in this State.
The facts set forth in appellant’s petition are, briefly, that in 1881 the Texas & St. Louis Railway Company, a corporation organized under the general laws of this State, acquired the right of way herein sued for, cleared the same off and graded a railway track thereon, but did not complete, equip, and put in good running order ten miles thereof within two years after the filing and recording of its articles of incorporation, whereby it is claimed said right of way and all that had been done thereon by said company became forfeited and subject to be appropriated by any new company that might take out a charter over the same way, without a new condemnation; and that in June, 1886, appellant took out such new charter and took possession of said right of way and the work done thereon as aforesaid, intending to build a road for itself over said line, and by reason of these facts claimed to be the owner of all the property so alleged to have been forfeited by said Texas & St. Louis Railway Company. That in January, 1887, appellee evicted appellant from said property, and completed a railway on said right of way, and has since been operating the same as its own.
It does not appear from the petition that appellant ever completed and put in running order any part of its road, although it is alleged that it was prevented from doing so by appellee, and that prior to its eviction it had done considerable work in the way of completing the grading, clearing the right of way, etc.
The value of said property is alleged to be $5000 per mile, and that there are forty miles of same, extending through Titus, Franklin, and Hopkins Counties.
The court sustained appellee’s general demurrer to appellant’s petition, and from this judgment this appeal is prosecuted.
Whatever our opinion may have been as an original proposition, it must now be received as the settled law of this State, that article 4278 of our Revised Statutes is self-executing, and that a railway incorporated under our general law which fails to comply with the provisions of said article, forfeits its corporate existence as to the unfinished part of its road, without the necessity of a judicial decree declaring such forfeiture in a direct proceeding instituted for that purpose. Bywaters v. Railway, 73 Texas, 624; Railway v. The State, 81 Texas, 572; Mayor of Houston v. Railway, 84 Texas, 590. It will be noticed, however, that it is only the forfeiture of the corporate existence of the association as to the unfinished part of its road that is declared by this article, and nothing is said therein as to the forfeiture of any property that it may have previously acquired; nor is its corporate existence as to the completed part of the road nor its right to retain and dispose of its property in any manner affected. The language of the article is: “ Such corporation shall forfeit its corporate existence and its powers shall cease as far as it relates to that portion of said road then unfinished, and shall be incapable of resumption by any subsequent act of incorporation.” It is therefore plain, that if appellant’s case depends upon its establishing a forfeiture by the Texas & St. Louis Railway Company of the valuable property rights alleged to have been acquired by it, it must do so under some provision of the law, either common or statutory, other than the article above quoted.
“ Under the common law the rule was, that upon the dissolution of a corporation its real estate reverted to the grantor, its personal property to the sovereign, and all debts due from and to it became extinguished, but this rule no longer has application to stock corporations in this country. On the dissolution of a stock corporation its assets become a trust fund for the discharge of its liabilities, and the surplus belongs to the shareholders. Equity will always furnish a means by which debts due a corporation can be collected after its dissolution, for the benefit of parties interested, either creditors or shareholders.” Taylor on Priv. Corp., 2 ed., sec. 437, and authorities there cited.
That this is the law in this State there can be no question. Our Revised Statutes, article 606, provide: “Upon the dissolution of any corporation already created by or under the laws of this State, unless a receiver is appointed by some court of competent authority, the president and directors or managers of the affairs of the corporation at the time of its dissolution, by whatever name they may be known in law, shall be trustees of the creditors and stockholders of such corporation, with full power to settle the affairs, collect the outstanding debts, and divide the moneys and other property among the stockholders, after paying the debts due and owing by such corporation at the time of its dissolution as far as such money and property will enable them; and for this purpose they may maintain or defend any judicial proceeding.” And in the case of Railway v. The State, 75 Texas, 378, our Supreme Court says: “Lawful dissolution of a corporation will destroy all its corporate franchises or privileges vested by the act of incorporation; but if it holds rights or privileges having the nature of property, secured by contract based on valuable consideration, these will survive the dissolution of the corporation for the benefit of those who may have right to or just claim upon its assets.” And as to this particular kind of property, it is expressly provided by our statute, that it shall not be forfeited by a forfeiture of its charter by the corporation.
Article 4206 of our Revised Statutes reads: “ The right of way secured or to be secured by any railway company in this State, in the manner provided by law, shall not be so construed as to include the fee simple estate in lands, either public or private, nor shall the same be lost by the forfeiture or expiration of the charter, but shall remain subject to an extension of the charter or the grant of a new charter over the same way, without a new condemnation.”
Appellant contends, that inasmuch as article 4278, cited above, provides that for a failure to comply therewith the corporation shall forfeit its corporate existence as to the unfinished part of its road, and “shall be incapable of resumption by any subsequent act of incorporation,” article 4206 should be construed as preserving the right of way for the first new company, not connected with the old, that will take possession of it. But we are of opinion that this contention is not sound, even if it be conceded (which we do not decide) that the State has the power thus to take property of this kind from one corporation and give it to another without compensation.
It will be noted that article 4206 was enacted long before article 4278, and at a time when there was nothing in our law to prohibit the granting of a new charter to the company forfeiting the one under which the right of way was acquired; and we think this article was intended to preserve for the parties entitled thereto the property thus acquired, and prevent it from reverting to the original grantors, and not to transfer it to another corporation as a gratuity.
It may be that by reason of the subsequent provision inserted in article 4278 the old corporation will not be able to obtain a new charter so as to utilize this right of way itself by building thereon, but it nevertheless remains its property, to be sold for the benefit of its creditors and stockholders to some company that can utilize it for the purposes for which it was acquired, and appellant shows affirmatively that it has no title thereto by failing to allege a claim under such corporation. Lewis on Em. Dom., sec. 594.
At any rate, we are of opinion that article 4206 does not give this right of way and the work done thereon to a new company not connected with the old; and even though we be in error in holding that it still remains the property of the old company, notwithstanding the forfeiture of its charter for the unfinished part of its road, appellant is in no better position, for in this case it must recover upon the strength of its own title, and not upon the weakness of its adversary’s. Railway v. Doe, ex dem Visscher, 114 U. S., 340.
Were it not for the provisions of our statute upon the subject, and the modification of the common law, as applied to the disposition of the property of stock corporations in this country upon their dissolution, it is quite probable that this right of way, having been acquired for a public use, would upon the forfeiture of the charter of the corporation vest in the State, to be applied by it to a similar use. Tifft v. Buffalo, 82 N. Y., 204. But we believe that the tendency of our courts of equity now is, even in the absence of a statute, to treat everything of value acquired by the corporation as a fund to be administered for the benefit of its creditors and shareholders upon its dissolution; and we think our statutory provisions leave no doubt upon the question in this State, and that the principle also extends to a right of way.
Articles 4219 and 4261 of our Revised Statutes seem to recognize the right of the corporation to mortgage this class of property as its own, and authorizes the sale thereof under such mortgage; article 4262 authorizes its sale as the property of the corporation under execution for its debts; article 4206 provides, that “it shall not be lost by the forfeiture or expiration of the charter;” and article 606 provides for the distribution of the money and property of a dissolved corporation among its creditors and stockholders. We think the language of our Supreme Court in Railway v. The State, 75 Texas, 378, quoted above, is very much in point in sustaining this view,
Article 4278 only forfeited the charter of the Texas & St. Louis Railway Company for the unfinished part of its road, but left it in existence as a corporation for the completed part, capable of holding and disposing of property acquired by it. 84 Texas, 590, supra.
Another very serious question presented by this record is this: From appellant’s third amended original petition it appears its charter was filed in June, 1886, and at the time of filing said amendment in November, 1889, it had not “constructed, equipped, and put in good running order as much as ten miles of its proposed road,” as required by article 4278; and as this article is held to be self-executing so as to show the death and forfeiture by the Texas & St. Louis Railway for a like failure on its part, why does it not establish the death of appellant pending this suit, and require its abatement ? It is well settled, that the dissolution of a corporation pending litigation abates the suit, unless it be revived under some provision of the statute. Life Association v. Goode, 71 Texas, 90; same case on former appeal, 2 Texas Law Rev., 151; Taylor on Priv. Corp., see. 435.
It will thus be seen that more than two years .had elapsed since January 1, 1887 (the extension granted by the act of 1885), before the filing of this amendment by appellant; and as the extension granted by the act of 1889 only applies to roads chartered since January 1, 1887, it would seem that there was nothing to save appellant, at the time of the trial below, from being in the deplorable condition in which it says it found the old Texas & St. Louis, unless it be the allegation that it was prevented from complying with said article by the acts of appellee. As to whether this will constitute a good answer to a forfeiture declared by a law of the State which decrees, that upon failure to comply with its provisions the corporation shall ipso facto cease to exist without a judicial ascertainment of such failure, we will not undertake to decide, as the question is not presented by the parties, and we only call attention to it in case of further litigation.
In the court below appellee vouched in several parties alleged to be its warrantors, and appellant complains that the costs thus incurred are erroneously adjudged against it. All of the parties hereto treat this as being an action of trespass to try title; and if so, it would seem that these warrantors were properly made parties, and the costs of so doing correctly adjudged, judgment having gone in their favor by reason of the failure of appellant to maintain its suit, and not on account of any issue between them and appellee. Rev. Stats., art. 4788. At any rate, it is well settled that before appellant can avail itself of an error of this kind on appeal, it must call it to the attention of the court below and seek to have it there corrected, Jones v. Ford, 60 Texas, 127; Wiebusch v. Taylor, 64 Texas, 53; Bridges v. Samuelson, 73 Texas, 522; Dalton v. Rainey, 75 Texas, 516.
Finding no error in the judgment rendered by the court below, let it be in all things affirmed.

Justice Stephens concurs in the result, but not in all the reasons therefor given in the opinion."
216302,The City of Hillsboro v. R. F. Ivey,1892-12-20,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
Appellee is a municipal corporation, organized under the laws of the State of Texas, and adopted the following ordinance:
11 It shall be the duty of the marshal to cause the removal and burial, at the expense of the city, of all carcasses of dead animals, the owner or person in charge of which can not be ascertained.”
In the month of February, 1888, the city marshal, in pursuance of this ordinance, had removed a large number of dead animals from one place in the city, where they had become offensive, to a point about 380 yards southeast of appellee’s house, where they became exceedingly offensive to appellee and his family, and could be smelled for a long distance even beyond appellee’s house. The marshal, upon several occasions after the first deposit, made other deposits of dead animals at the same place, which added somewhat to the offensive odor. Two attempts were made by the marshal to burn these carcasses, the first of which, being ineffectual, only added to the nuisance. These deposits were made at this place by permission of the agent of the owner of the land, who was also an alderman of the city, and who had previously tendered the land to the city council for this purpose, which ""was accepted by it. The agent, however, imposed as a condition that the animals should be burned or destroyed, and not buried thereon.
Appellee made complaint of the nuisance before bringing his suit, both to the marshal and mayor of the city, and some of the deposits were made after these notices, and even after the filing of plaintiff’s petition. To recover for the damages sustained by himself and wife for the nuisance thus created and maintained by authority of the city, appellee instituted this suit, and recovered judgment in the sum of 8287.50, from which this appeal is prosecuted.
Appellant’s first and second assignments of error complain of the action of the court in overruling its exceptions to plaintiff’s second amended original petition. We are of opinion that this assignment is not well baken. The petition, as we think, very clearly sets forth a cause of action against appellant, under repeated decisions of our Supreme Court. City of Fort Worth v. Crawford, 74 Texas, 404; City of Fort Worth v. Crawford, 64 Texas, 202; Langham v. City of Sherman, 13 S. W. Rep., 1042.
Appellant’s fourth assignment of error is as follows: 1 ‘ The court erred in instructing the jury in the'first part of the court’s charge as follows: 1 If you believe from the evidence that the defendant, by an ordinance passed by the council of defendant, duly and legally assembled as such, ordered the city marshal to remove the bodies of dead animals beyond the limits of the city, and shall further believe that the city marshal, acting under such ordinance, for the purpose of promoting and protecting the sanitary condition of said city, wrongfully and negligently caused the carcasses of dead animals to be removed beyond the limits of said city and placed so near the house of said plaintiff as to create a stench, which injured and damaged plaintiff as alleged in the petition, then you will find for the plaintiff as damages such sum as you may under the evidence believe plaintiff entitled to recover, not to exceed the sum of $2000, and so say by your verdict.’ This part of the charge is vague, wrong, and indefinite, and calculated to mislead the jury; for, according to the allegations in plaintiff’s petition, the damage to plaintiff, if any, arose from the carcasses alleged to have been deposited at a designated point southeast of plaintiff’s house, the city ordinance introduced in evidence forbidding such deposit within 400 yards of a private house. But under the charge of the court the jury might find a verdict for plaintiff on account of any other offensive deposits made or caused to be made by defendant’s officers or agents near the house, even though in violation of the city ordinances; nor is this feature remedied in any other portion of the charge. Under such a charge, also, the jury might find against defendant if private parties hauled carcasses there in violation of the city ordinances, provided especially if the jury believe them influenced in so doing by the acts or words of any officer, agent, or servant of the city; 'Or the jury might find against the defendant even though they believe the acts charged to have been done by a police officer or other officer for whose acts, under such an ordinance, the defendant would not be liable, and that though the city council had no notice of the acts, and though the marshal or other officer was acting under a general ordinance of the city, which left the manner of the performance of his duty under it to his own discretion, as seems to appear from the evidence in this cause, and not under an ordinance which made it compulsory upon him to do the acts in the manner, time, and place as charged in the petition.”
We think a careful reading of the charge quoted in this assignment will show that it is not subject to any of the valid objections made to it in the argument also contained in the assignment. The objection that the charge authorized a recovery for the nuisance caused by carcasses placed near the house of appellee, but not in an exact southeastern direction therefrom, we regard as hypercritical. We do not understand the averment as to the direction the carcasses were deposited from appellee’s house as necessary to be proven with the exactness indicated by the opinion of counsel as disclosed in this assignment. Also, we do not think the charge subject to the objection that it authorized a recovery for damage caused by carcasses deposited by others than the marshal acting under an ordinance of the city.
We are also of opinion that if the city, by its ordinance, left the place and manner of depositing to the marshal, it would be responsible for a negligent performance of the duties thus conferred upon him. The ordinance of the city which appellant complains of as having prohibited the deposit in less than 400 yards of any private residence relates entirely to the acts of private parties, and isas follows: “ It shall not be lawful for any person or persons in this city to allow or permit any horse or other animal owned or controlled or kept by him, her, or them, and which has come to its death by disease or otherwise, to lie or remain upon any street, alley, square, or other ground, public or private, but such person or persons shall cause the carcasses of such animal or animals to be securely buried or taken outside the corporate limits of this city and deposited not less than 400 yards from any private-residence.” It will thus be seen that while private parties were prohibited from making such deposits in a less distance than 400 yards of private residences, there was no limit placed upon the power of the city and its officers in this respect by the ordinance quoted in the conclusions of fact.
Appellant’s sixth assignment of error complains of the action of the court in refusing to give a special charge requested by it, to the effect that appellant could not be held liable for the alleged ratification of the acts of others without a full knowledge of the facts in the premises. An examination of the court’s charge will show that the question of ratification was not submitted to the jury at all, and under the charge as given, the jury were only authorized to find in favor of appellee in case they found that appellant was guilty of negligence in the first instance in causing the nuisance. Under these circumstances, we are of opinion that no injury could have resulted to appellant from the refusal to give this requested charge, even though there may have been evidence on the subject of ratification by it. Defendant may have been liable upon two grounds, yet only one ground of liability was submitted to the jury, and they were carefully instructed not to find against appellant unless they found the facts creating the liability upon this ground.
Appellant’s seventh assignment of error complains of the action of the court in refusing to give a special charge requested by it, to the effect that it was incumbent upon plaintiff to prove negligence on the part of the city of Hillsboro. As indicated above, we are of opinion that if the city council by ordinance confided the manner of performance of this duty to the city marshal, it would be responsible for his negligent performance of such duty, and this phase of negligence was repeatedly submitted to the jury in the charge given by the court.
Delivered December 20, 1892.
What we have already said sufficiently shows that we are of opinion that the court did not err in overruling appellant’s motion for a new trial, as complained of in its eighth and tenth assignments of error.
Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be in all things affirmed, and it is so ordered.
Affirmed."
216245,Blankenship & Blake Co. v. P. J. Willis & Bro.,1892-12-20,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
J. Y. and B. E. Procter, doing business as retail merchants under the firm name of Procter Bros., in the town of Hillsboro, made a transfer of their entire stock of goods under circumstances which gave rise to this lawsuit. On the 1st day of February, 1887, J. Y. Procter sold to his partner his interest in the business in consideration of $75, secured by the promissory note of B. E. Procter, and the assumption on the part of the latter of the debts of the firm. Thereafter, on the 4th day of said month, B. E. Procter sold and delivered the entire stock of goods, valued at $6685.12, to appellant, the Blankenship & Blake Co., in settlement of a debt owed by said firm to appellant of $6535.49, and for the further consideration that appellant would pay to J. V. Procter the $75 note and a debt of $33 owed by said firm for clerk hire, which sums appellant did afterwards pay. The transaction was accomplished by appellant through its agent, Owen Burnett. Thereafter, on the 7th day of February, appellees, P. J. Willis & Bro., who were also creditors of said firm, seized under attachment a portion of said stock of goods, which were claimed by appellant under the statute for the trial of the right of property; and from a verdict and judgment in favor of appellees as to the property so claimed this appeal is prosecuted.
The evidence discloses the insolvency of Procter Bros, at the time of these transactions, and there seems to have been no dispute on this, point in the trial court. A letter was read in evidence, dated February 9, 1887, from appellant to appellees, containing, among other things, in speaking of the failure of Procter Bros., this statement: “ Our agent, ■Mr. Burnett, happened there, and found that they really were in bad shape, and found that one of the brothers had bought the other out and was running the firm in an insolvent condition.” It also contains statements showing that the purpose of appellant and its agent in the transaction was to secure its debt. We conclude from the statement quoted above, there being nothing in the record in conflict with it, that appellant’s agent had notice at the time he acquired the stock of goods of the undisputed insolvency of Procter Bros.
It also appears from the evidence that Burnett knew of the existence of appellees’ debt, but it does not clearly appear from the evidence that he took more goods than were reasonably required to satisfy appellant’s claim under the circumstances; and if so, that this was knowingly done. There is some evidence of a purpose on the part of Burnett to have' that part of the transaction concealed in which he agreed to pay money as a part consideration.
The court refused to permit appellant to prove by the witness Burnett that his sole motive or purpose in making the purchase of the stock of goods was to collect the indebtedness against Procter Bros., and upon this the first error is assigned.
It is no longer an open question in this State that such testimony is admissible. Hamburg v. Wood, 66 Texas, 168; Sweeney v. Conley, 71 Texas, 543; Brown v. Lessing, 70 Texas, 544.
Complaint is also made of the action of the court in giving and refusing charges, and we are of opinion that some of the charges given contained error.
It is well settled by numerous decisions of our Supreme Court, that where an insolvent debtor pays one of his creditors in property, and more property is conveyed than, under all the circumstances, would be reasonably required to pay the debt, and such creditor has knowledge of the insolvency, the existence of other creditors, and the excess in value of the goods received, the transaction is such as the law condemns, whether this excess is appropriated by the creditor to his own use or is paid to the debtor in money or negotiable paper. Elser v. Graber, 69 Texas, 222, and cases there cited. These cases, however, do not hold that where a preferred creditor pays money or executes a negotiable note to the insolvent debtor as part consideration for the transfer, the transaction will be declared fraudulent in law, where it is not made to appear that more goods have been knowingly received than are reasonably required to pay his debt. The true distinction applicable to the facts of this case is made in the case of Oppenheimer v. Halff & Bro., 68 Texas, 409.
Delivered December 20, 1892.
Where the property received by the preferred creditor is no more than is reasonably required to satisfy his debt, taking into consideration the expense incident to a conversion of the property into money, the invalidity of the transfer must result from proof of a fraudulent intent in fact on the part of the debtor and preferred creditor, which would taint the entire transaction. The testimony excluded, as to the intention of Burnett, was therefore material; and the charge should have properly submitted to the jury whether or not, under all the proof, more goods were knowingly received by appellant than were reasonably required to satisfy its debt; and if not, whether the transaction was open and fair, solely for the purpose on the part of appellant and its agent of collecting a just debt; or whether there was also a fraudulent purpose, to which appellant’s agent was privy. One of the charges complained of, in effect took the case from the jury, and held the transaction in question to be fraudulent, provided Burnett knew that the $75 note which he assumed was given in consideration of the sale of the goods from B. E. to J, V. Procter. The charge given at the request of appellees is subject to a like objection.
For the errors in excluding above evidence and in the charge of the court, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.

219252,Bowie Lumber Company v. O. T. Lyon,1893-03-23,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This suit was brought by appellant to recover a balance of $1439.85 due for lumber sold appellee. The defense set up was, that appellee had purchased from time to time, through one W. L. Whittaker, various bills of lumber from appellant, the Bowie Lumber Company, and the Jefferson Lumber Company, both corporations. and from the following firms: Whittaker & Rosborough, Whittaker, Galloway & Co., Whittaker & Galloway, and W. L. & B. Whittaker. He alleged that W. L. Whittaker was interested in and general agent and manager of all of the said concerns; that all of his dealings with said concerns, including appellant, had been through said Whittaker; and that in transacting the business the orders for lumber had been placed with the different concerns by Whittaker at his discretion, and that all payments for the lumber so purchased had been made to or through or under the direction of said Whittaker. There was much conflict in the evidence.
The seventh assignment of error complains of that part of the fifth paragraph of the court’s charge wherein the jury were instructed, that a payment to W. L. Whittaker, or to a firm of which he was a member, would be a payment to appellant. In so far as this charge, under the circumstances therein stated, instructed the jury that a payment to Whit-taker would be a payment to appellant, it is believed to be correct; but in charging the jury that a payment made to a firm of which Whittaker was a member would be a payment to appellant, we think it was erroneous and misleading.' The fact, as set forth in that paragraph of the charge, that Whittaker was the general agent of the several firms and corporations in selling lumber and collecting the money, would not of itself authorize a payment of moneys due appellant to a firm of which Whittaker was a member, but in which appellant was not interested. It may be that the statement of facts does not fully present the case as tried below, and that as there presented the charge was not misleading, but we must pass upon the record as we find it. If there was evidence showing that Whit-taker had authority, real or apparent, to direct and did direct the payment of money due appellant to others, it has escaped our attention.
It is not believed that the other assignments of error would require a reversal of the judgment, and as they relate to matters which may not arise upon another trial, they will not be further considered.
The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.
Reversed and remanded.

216275,Clay & Browne v. Gage & Wood,1892-12-20,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
In the months of September, October, and November, 1889, appellees, Gage & Wood, were engaged in keeping a cotton yard in the town of Hillsboro. Appellants, through their agent, A. S. Johnson, were engaged at the same time and place in buying cotton. It was the custom of appellees in the transaction of their business, when a bale of cotton was left in their care, to issue to the owner a receipt, called a ticket, of substantially the following tenor: “ Received of-one bale of cotton for account of [name of owner], deliverable to bearer on return of this certificate and payment of charges'. Risks of fire excepted.” Upon this receipt were endorsed the weight and price and also the number marked upon the bale of cotton. In the latter part of September of that year, appellants, through their said agent, purchased of Stroud & Yerby, who held the receipts of Gage & Wood in the usual form, nine certain bales of cotton, which were transferred and delivered by a delivery of the receipts given for the nine bales of cotton. Thereafter these receipts were lost, according to the positive testimony of their said agent, which was not contradicted by any other testimony introduced on the trial of this cause, though the court found in his conclusions of fact that the loss of these receipts was not shown.
Upon discovering that he was short the nine tickets, appellants’ agent promptly notified appellees of this fact, and demanded the possession,of the nine bales of cotton, marking each of them in red ink and furnishing to appellees a memorandum of the numbers of said bales of cotton, and protesting against their shipping or otherwise disposing of them. Appellees refused to comply with the demands of appellants unless they would produce the tickets or give an indemnity bond against future liability, which appellants failed to do.
Thereafter appellees shipped or delivered one of these nine bales, No. 2999, to some unknown person in exchange for one of the alleged lost tickets. The testimony of appellees tended to corroborate rather than contradict that of appellants’ agent in reference to his selecting, marking, and demanding the nine bales of cotton prior to any disposition of the No. 2999, though the court, in the conclusions of fact, found that this number was shipped out in good faith in due course of business. This demand is alleged by appellants to have been made on the 4th of November of the year 1889, and the proof shows that it was made on or before that time.
It was proven that the market value of the cotton at about that date and subsequently was 9-£ cents per pound, and that the several bales were of the weight alleged in plaintiffs’ petition. Appellants sued for the cotton or its value, and seem to have seized and replevied all the bales except No. 2999, though the record does not contain any of the sequestration proceedings. Judgment was rendered against appellants as to bale No. 2999, and the costs of the suit, and in their favor for the other bales, conditioned upon their executing to appellees an indemnity bond in the sum of $500, to be approved by the clerk of the court, within sixty days; and upon their failure to do so, that they take nothing by their suit, and that appellees recover against them and the sureties on their replevy bond the sum of $400, the value of said cotton, and the costs of suit; from which judgment this appeal is prosecuted.
If the principles of negotiable instruments should be deemed entirely applicable to the receipts issued by appellees in the form set forth in the conclusions of fact, the judgment, in so far as it conditioned a recovery by the appellants on the execution of an indemnity bond, should be sustained. Dan. on Neg. Inst., sec. 1480. This rule results from that quality of negotiable paper which enables the holder in due course of trade to recover upon it, though his title be derived from the finder of lost paper or from one who has stolen it. Where the maker runs no risk of a second payment the rule has no application. Dan. on Neg. Inst., secs. 1481-1485.
The receipt in question is essentially a warehouseman’s receipt, and is also analogous to a bill of lading of a common carrier, in form negotiable. It is held by the Supreme Court of the United States, even under statutes which declare bills of lading to be negotiable by endorsements and delivery, that, inasmuch as they represent goods and not money, in ease they should be lost or stolen, a bona fide holder who derives his title from a finder or a thief could not recover, as in case of negotiable paper under the law merchant.
Any other holding would place the symbol upon a better footing than the thing represented, it being well settled that title to personal property can not be derived from one who has found it or stolen it from the owner. It follows that the cotton receipts in question are not clothed by the law with that superior quality of negotiable paper which enables a bona fide holder to recover, though the owner has not parted with his title. The reason for the rule therefore which requires indemnity from the loser as a condition precedent to recovery does not exist in this case. The true owner might, through his negligence or carelessness, be estopped from asserting his title against one holding from the finder or the thief, but no such case is here presented. Shaw v. Railway, 101 U. S., 416; Fried-lander v. Railway, 130 U. S., 416; Hutch, on Carr., 2 ed., sec. 129.
It is settled in this State, that the owner of property held by a bailee may sue to recover it from the bailee, though not a party to the contract of bailment. Roberts v. Yarboro, 41 Texas, 453; Nelson v. King, 25 Texas, 663.
Delivered December 20, 1892.
We conclude that the judgment must be reversed and here rendered in favor of appellants for the nine bales of cotton, or the value of each, with lawful interest from November 4, 1887, and for costs. If the records below show that appellants have already, acquired the possession by replevy bond of any part of said cotton, that will operate a satisfaction pro tanto of this judgment.
Reversed and rendered."
216217,Wm. F. Robertson v. George T. Coates et al.,1892-12-07,"ICEY, Associate Justice.
This is an action of trespass to try title to about 250 acres of land near the city of Waco, commenced June 21,1881. Appellant was plaintiff in the court below, and Geo. T. Coatés and several other persons named in the pleadings were defendants.
The defendants all answered, by general demurrers, pleas of not guilty, three, five, and ten years statutes of limitations, and all, except defendant Little, suggested improvements in good faith. The second trial of the case in the District Court occurred in October, 1888, in which a verdict was returned, and judgment entered thereon, for the defendants.
Upon the testimony in the record this court finds:
1. Plaintiff and defendants claim title to the land in controversy under Felix W. Robertson as a common source.
2. August 23, J858, Felix W. Robertson executed a mortgage to Rebecca B. Robertson and Wilson Y. McFarland on the property involved in this suit, and on several other tracts of land in Washington and other counties in Texas. This instrument recites the fact that Felix W. Robertson had been appointed guardian of the person and estate of Felix F. Robertson, a minor, by the County Court of Washington County, and as such had in his hands between $5000 and $10,000; that Wilson Y. MeFarland and Henry Y. Robertson had become sureties on his bond as such guardian, and that he desires to secure and save them harmless, etc. It then conveys the land therein described to secure and save harmless said Felix F. Robertson, by reason of the appointment of said Felix W. Robertson as his guardian; and second, to secure and save harmless the said Wilson Y. McFarland and Rebecca B. Robertson from all liabilities incurred by them by reason of said McFarland and Henry V. Robertson having become sureties on said Felix W. Robertson’s bond as such guardian. This mortgage contains the following stipulation, viz.: “ But it is further expressly stipulated and agreed, that in the meantime the said party of the first part shall have the privilege of selling or disposing of any or all the tracts or parcels of land aforesaid, for the best price and upon such terms as he may see proper, always appropriating the proceeds thereof to the payment and extinguishment of his and his sureties’ liabilities on the bond as guardian, and not otherwise.”
This mortgage was recorded in the record of deeds, mortgages, etc., of McLennan County, Texas, in which county the land in controversy is situate, on the 30th day of August, 1858.
3. On the-day of September, 1859, Felix W. Robertson executed a power of attorney to “ D. H. Love, guardian of the minor F. F. Robertson,” authorizing him to sell and convey all the several tracts of land described in and conveyed by the mortgage above referred to in the second finding.
This is in the usual form of such instruments, except that it describes D. H. Love as guardian of the minor F. F. Robertson. It was duly recorded in the county clerk’s office of McLennan County, August 11, 1862.
4. October 24, 1860, a judgment was rendered in the District Court of Washington County, Texas, at the suit and in favor of David H. Love, as guardian of said Felix F. Robertson, and against Felix W. Robertson and Wilson Y. McFarland, and W. II. Robertson, administrator of the estate of Henry V. Robertson, deceased, on the bond of Felix W. Robertson as guardian of said Felix F. Robertson, for $8357.82, with 8 per cent interest from date of judgment; and with a decree foreclosing the aforesaid mortgage on all the lands covered by it, and ordering them sold as under execution for the satisfaction of said judgment for $8357.82.
5. An order of sale and execution issued on said judgment January 28, 1861, to Bell County; and the sheriff’s return thereon shows a levy and advertisement for sale, but sale held up by order of plaintiff’s attorney. Also similar order of sale to Bell County, issued May 16, 1861, with like return thereon.
6. Felix F. Robertson died October 14, 1862, while he was a minor, leaving as his only heirs Alice F, Robertson, his surviving wife, and Win. F. Robertson, their only child, and now plaintiff herein.
7. In July, 1862, D. H. Love, acting under the aforesaid power of attorney from Felix W. Eobertson, negotiated a sale of 90 acres of the land involved in this suit to E. B. Burleson, and the remainder thereof to a partnership known as Wheeler & Owens, consisting of J. W. Wheeler and S. A. Owens. July 28, 1862, Felix W. Eobertson, by D. H. Love, his attorney in fact, executed a bond for title to said E. B. Burleson, agreeing to convey the 90 acres of said land so negotiated to him (describing it by metes and bounds) by warranty deed. This instrument recites a consideration of $240 cash, and $480 to become due November 1, 1863, bearing 10 per cent interest from date. It was shown by parol evidence that all this purchase money was paid to Love. The first payment was made in July, 1862, but the testimony does not show when the other payment was made, nor does it show the amount of each payment.
8. The consideration for the Wheeler & Owens purchase was $946, and the deed executed therefor in February, 1863, recites that it was a cash payment. Parol testimony indicates that about half of it was paid in July, 1862, and the other half probably after the death of Felix F. Eobertson .
9. It was shown that there had been a bond for title for the Wheeler & Owens purchase, which is now lost; that it was also executed by said D. H. Love; and the jury found that it was executed by Love as agent for Felix W. Eobertson prior to the death of Felix F. Eobertson; and though the testimony on these issues is meager, we hold it is sufficient to support the verdict.
10. January 20, 1863, Felix W. Eobertson, by D. H. Love, agent, by warranty deed, reciting a cash consideration of $720, conveyed said 90 acres to said E. B. Burleson. This deed was duly recorded in McLennan County August 28, 1863; conveys same land described in bond for title, but does not refer to the bond.
11. February 4, 1863, Felix W. Eobertson, by D. H. Love, agent, by deed conveyed 157.7 acres, the remainder of the land in controversy, to Wheeler <fc Owens. . •
Plaintiff admitted that this was a deed duly executed, but denied that it was properly authenticated for record, though it had been put on record; but as the parties have agreed that if the judgment is not affirmed the case is to be remanded, and as the question is not raised by assignment of error, the certificate of authentication is not copied in this finding.
12. Transfers from said Burleson down to defendants Allen, Hohen, Sparra, Bloomer, Eastland, and Green, to part of the Burleson 90 acres, and descent cast to balance to defendants Burlesons, Moores, and Bodneys (as shown by appellant’s brief).
Transfers from Wheeler & Owens down to defendants Coates, Little, and Compton for the land acquired by them under their purchase from D. H. Love, as agent aforesaid.
13. October 5, 1874, the judgment of the District Court of Washington County, Texas-, rendered October 24, 1860, in favor of D. II. Love, as guardian of Felix F. Robertson, against Felix W. Robertson etal., was revived as against said Felix W. Robertson.
14. The suit to revive the judgment was brought by Alice F. Robertson, as surviving wife of Felix F. Robertson and as guardian of Wm. F. Robertson, the present plaintiff; and in her petition she made Felix W. Robertson, Wm. H. Robertson, as administrator of the estate of Henry V. Robertson, X. B. Sanders, administrator of the estate of Wilson Y. McFarland, R. B. Burleson, James H. Fry, John S. Allen, S. A. Owens, and J. W. Wheeler defendants.
At the trial demurrers interposed by the defendants William H. Robertson, R. B. Burleson, S. A. Owens, J. W. Wheeler, John S. Allen, and James H. Fry were sustained, and they were dismissed. The latter judgment revives the former against Felix W. Robertson only, and recites that the plaintiffs being the only heirs of Felix F. Robertson, deceased, the former judgment shall be in full force and effect in their behalf as plaintiffs against said Felix W. Robertson, and that executions and orders of sale may issue, etc.
15. February 9, 1875, an order of sale and execution was issued on said judgment for sale of the land in Washington County, covered by said mortgage and decree, and same was sold thereunder to F. W. Robertson.
16. October 21, 1875, a similar order of sale and execution was issued to Bell County for the sale of the land in that county, and same sold thereunder to Mrs. Alice F. Robertson.
17. March 7, 1876, similar order of sale and execution was issued to Williamson County, and land sold thereunder to Alice F. Robertson.
18. August 23, 1876, an order of sale and execution was issued on said judgment for any balance unpaid, to McLennan County, ordering the sale of the land in controversy as under execution, with endorsements thereon showing the total credits to which the judgment was then entitled to be 81775.91. The sheriff’s return endorsed thereon shows a levy on said land September 9, 1876, due notice of sale, and sale made in pursuance thereof, in conformity to law, on the first Tuesday (3d day) of October, 1876, to William F. Robertson, plaintiff herein, for $35, and a deed made accordingly, and crediting the proceeds on the writ.
19. October 3,1876, P. F. Ross, as sheriff of McLennan County, Texas, executed a deed, in due form, conveying the land in controversy, under said writ, levy, and sale, to William F. Robertson, plaintiff herein. Said deed was duly recorded in -land records of McLennan County, October 16, 1876.
20. Neither of the heirs of Felix F. Robertson — Alice F. Robertson and the plaintiff herein — ever received any of the consideration paid by R. B. Burleson and Wheeler & Owens to D. H. Love for the land in controversy.
21. D. II. Love died in 1866, and was at the time of his death insolvent.
22. It was shown at the time of the trial that R. B. Burleson and J. W. Wheeler were dead; the former died in 1879 and the latter between 1874 and 1879,.
23. At the time R. B. Burleson and Wheeler & Owens purchased the land in controversy from D. H. Love as agent for F. W. Robertson, they had no actual knowledge of the mortgage executed thereon by said F. W. Robertson, nor of the judgment of the District Court of Washington County, foreclosing the mortgage.
24. There appears to have been testimony tending to support the pleas of limitation and improvements in good faith; but it is not set out in detail in the statement of facts, but it is agreed therein that the testimony on these issues requires that they be submitted to a jury, should the case be reversed.
On the former appeal in this case (Robertson v. Coates, 65 Texas, 37), the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Willie covering the salient features of the case, held, that after the execution of the power of attorney by F. W. Robertson to D. H. Love in September, 1859, and the foreclosure, in 1860, by Love, as guardian of the estate of F. F. Robertson, of the mortgage executed by F. W. Robertson in 1858, said Love “ held united in himself, as guardian of F. F. Robertson, all the right to sell which F. W. Robertson’s power of attorney could give him, and also the privilege of having the land sold under the decree of foreclosure and in satisfaction of it. Between these two methods of converting the land into money he could choose; and by either he could convey a good title to a purchaser.”
It was held, however, that his power to sell, in so far as it affected the rights of his ward, terminated with the death of the latter, and that any sales made by Love subsequent to the death of F. F. Robertson, his ward, conferred no title. The opinion then states that if the evidence had been clear and positive • that Wheeler & Owens, under whom some of the defendants claim, had purchased before the death of the ward, the judgment would have been affirmed: But as the record left the date of their purchase in doubt, and the question had not been submitted to the jury, the cause was reversed and remanded.
At the trial from which this appeal has resulted this issue alone was submitted to the jury, and they found, in effect, that the Wheeler & Owens purchase was made, and bond for title executed and delivered, prior to the death of F. F. Robertson, the ward.
On the present appeal, it is contended, in behalf of appellant, that the former opinion should not control the decision of the case; (1) because the facts on this appeal are different from those appearing in the record of the former appeal; and (2) because the doctrine announced, as above stated, on that appeal, is unsound and ought not to be adheredito.
1. As to the first of these positions, it is claimed that the record in the former appeal did not clearly disclose the fact that the mortgage above referred to was given to secure the ward, F. F. Robertson, as well as the sureties on F. W. Robertson’s bond.
It is true that the mortgage was not copied in full in the record in that case, as it is in this; but the clause reserving the right to sell the land, and requiring the proceeds to be appropriated to the extinguishment of F. W. Robertson’s liability on his bond as guardian of F. F. Robertson, is copied in full in the statement of facts. The judgment and decree of the District Court of Washington County, rendered upon and foreclosing the mortgage in question, in favor of Love, as guardian and for the benefit of F. F. Robertson, his ward, as well as the judgment reviving the same in 1874, were copied in full in the transcript on the former appeal; and the original decree recites the fact that the mortgage was executed to secure F. W. Robertson’s indebtedness to his ward, F. F. Robertson. There is nothing in the opinion of the Supreme Court indicating that it was not understood, as clearly disclosed by the former record, that at the time of the sales to Burleson and Wheeler & Owens, F. F. Robertson, under whom appellant claims, had a lien on the land, first secured by a mortgage, but at the time of said sales merged into a judgment.
On the contrary, it is apparent that the court appreciated the fact that the mortgage, given only in substance in the former record (which omits to state that it was given to secure F. W. Robertson’s ward, as well as his sureties), was the identical mortgage that was foreclosed in behalf of the ward, by the judgment of the District Court of Washington County, because in the opinion it is so stated, and it is held that the judgment referred to cancelled F. W. Robertson’s right to sell the land, arising out of the reservation, which is copied in the former record as part of the mortgage referred to.
On the questions ruled on, we do not think the record before the Supreme Court, which we have carefully examined, is essentially different from the one sent up on this appeal.
2. It may be true that appellate tribunals may sometimes render decisions so obviously wrong as that other courts, of lower rank, will be justified in disregarding them upon other trials of the same cases. Such cases, however, are exceptional and of rare occurrence; and the present case does not belong to that class. We shall hold that the former opinion announces the law of this case, and we think the court below correctly interpreted the same when it submitted but the one issue to the jury.
The record on the other appeal clearly disclosed the fact that the deeds from F. W. Robertson, by Love as agent, to Burleson and Wheeler & Owens were executed subsequent to the death of F. F. Robertson; and in view of this fact, when the Supreme Court held that the validity of sales made by Love was dependent upon whether they were made before or after the death of his ward, we conclude that court did not refer to the execution of the deeds, but rather to the time when the contracts of sale were made.
The fifteenth assignment of error complains of the refusal of the court to charge the jury, at request of appellant, that the search made for the supposed bond for title to Wheeler <fe Owens, as shown by the evidence, was not in law sufficient, and that they should disregard all the evidence relating to it. Appellant did not object to the introduction of the testimony tending to show the execution, loss, and contents of the bond in question because sufficient search had not been made for it; and not having made such objection, we do not think he had the right, after the evidence was closed, to raise substantially that objection by a special charge. If the objection had been made to the testimony, and sustained, appellees might have produced the legal representative of Judge Renick, in whose custody this bond was last seen, and proved that it could not be found among his papers.
What has already been said disposes of tne controlling questions in the case, and all of the assignments of error predicated upon the action of the District Court in giving and refusing charges, except the seventeenth, which, under the statute and rules, is too general. It merely charges that the court erred in adding a certain qualification to special charge No. 9 asked by appellant, without pointing out why such qualification was error. Was it because the testimony did not warrant the qualification, or was it because it was upon the weight of evidence ? A charge may be erroneous for several reasons, and an assignment of error challenging its correctness should assign a reason why it is alleged to be incorrect.
There are several assignments of error based upon the ruling of the court in admitting or rejecting testimony, all of which refer to certain bills of exceptions, by number, for appellant’s reasons for claiming that the court erred.
Nowhere in appellant’s brief are the reasons given for the assertions that the court committed error in the rulings referred to, and to ascertain why he charges error in these matters we are compelled to examine the bills of exceptions in the record. The rules are designed to enable appellate courts to decide cases without looking to the record, except where counsel for the parties differ as to what appears therein.
Ordinarily an assignment of error ought to be complete in itself; and if it is not, and there is something else in the record essential to an intelligent ruling upon it, the latter ought at least to be embraced in the statement under the assignment. Under the statute and rules, the assignments referred to are insufficient, and will not be considered. Sup. Ct. Rules 24, 25; Bev. Stats., art. 1037.
The last assignment of error complains of the action of the court in overruling appellant’s motion for a new trial, charging that the verdict of the jury is contrary to the law and the evidence, and that the jury were influenced by certain alleged improper conduct of one of appellee’s counsel.
As stated in our finding of facts on the issues submitted to the jury, the testimony, though meager, supports the verdict.
As to the other matter complained of, it appears that one of appellees’ counsel demanded the right to inspect and offer in evidence a certain written instrument shown to be in the custody of one of appellant’s counsel; that he was asked by appellant’s counsel to state his purpose for desiring to see and introduce the instrument in evidence; that he then stated that he expected to prove by the instrument that a part of, if not all, the land in controversy had been conveyed to appellant’s attorneys before this suit was brought; that while he was making this statement, one of appellant’s counsel objected to it being made in the hearing of the jury, charging that the statement was intended for the jury; that the objection was not heeded, and the statement completed; that appellant’s counsel then handed the paper to the court for inspection, and after reading it the bourt stated, in the hearing of the jury, that it was not a conveyance, was a private paper not admissible in evidence, and that the counsel would not be required to submit it ,to the inspection of others; that appellees’ counsel then, in a rather loud and authoritative tone, stated that he wished to inspect the paper for the purpose of preparing a bill of exceptions to the ruling of the court, and upon objection the request was refused. It also appears that appellees’ counsel, in addressing the jury, stated that the perseverance of appellant’s counsel, their manner of conducting the case, and what had transpired during the trial in the hearing of the jury, showed them to be largely interested in the result of the suit; and stated that appellant showed a grasping spirit in the manner of interrogating witnesses in reference to improvements.
While there may have been some departure from that decorum which should always prevail in a court of justice, we do not believe that the conduct of appellees’ counsel, complained of by appellant, improperly influenced the jury. Besides, the statement of what he expected to prove by the written instrument was made at the request of one of appellant’s attorneys. If the tone of voice in which he demanded an inspection of the paper was in excess of the rules of propriety, we do not perceive why that fact should have influenced the jury against appellant.
Delivered December 7, 1892.
The judge states, in qualifying the bill of exception, that the language used in argument was not objected to at the time; and we do not think it was calculated to improperly influence a jury of ordinary honesty and intelligence.
We have considered all the questions properly presented in appellant’s brief, and finding no reversible error, the judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed."
219247,W. G. Barry v. V. W. Hale et al.,1893-03-23,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
The only question in this case is, whether or not the following evidence shows that the lot in question was exempt from forced sale as the homestead of a family; to-wit: “lam the plaintiff in this case. I am a single man,-years of age, and have never been married. I own the house and lot, the subject matter of this suit. I bought the lot something over three years ago for a home for my widowed mother, my sister, and myself. My mother is well advanced in years, and has no other homestead. Soon after I bought the lot, I built the house now on it, and when completed, my mother and sister, and also a younger brother, moved in the house, and they and myself have been living in it ever since as a home, and neither my mother nor I have any other home. I bought and paid for all the furniture in the house, except a few things in my mother’s room belonging to my mother. We occupied the house as our home at the date of the execution which was enjoined in this case, and now so occupy it. I support my mother out of my own earnings.”
We believe that this evidence certainly describes a family within the ordinary meaning of this word, and we are also of opinion that it shows such a family as was intended by our Constitution and exemption statute. It is true, it is not stated in so many words that appellant’s mother had no other property, and was dependent upon him for a support, but we believe that this is the fair construction that should be placed upon the evidence. It is stated that his mother has no other home, and that he supports her out of his own earnings, and we believe it would be attributing to appellant qualities far above the average to co'nstrue this evidence as meaning that he is taking care of his mother out of his own earnings, although she has property from which she could support herself.
We believe it would comport more with common experience to look for the son to use the mother’s property in supporting himself, rather than expect him to support an independent mother out of his own earnings. If his mother is dependent upon him for a support, it can hardly be contended that appellant would not be entitled to this exemption. Roco v. Green, 50 Texas, 483; Wolfe v. Buckley, 52 Texas, 641; Ramey v. Allison, 64 Texas, 697.
In Wolf v. Buckley it was held that an old lady, taking care of dependent step-grandchildren, was entitled to the homestead exemption, although such children had no legal claim upon her.
We have copied in the opinion all of the evidence in the case, which will be taken as our conclusions of fact.
We are of opinion, that the court below erred in holding the property not exempt, and in dissolving the injunction; and as the trial was before the court without a jury, the judgment will be reversed, and will here be-rendered perpetuating the injunction as prayed for in appellant’s petition.
Reversed and rendered.

The defendant in error is the administrator de bonis non of the estate of Thomas Barron, deceased. His predecessor in a representative capacity was Katie Barron. As administratrix of the estate of Thomas Barron, she brought this suit against W. W. Bush, J. J. Hittson, and Jack Hittson, to recover the amount alleged to be due on a promissory note charged to have been executed by W. W. Bush, J. J. Hittson, and Jack Hittson ,and payable ‘ ‘to the order of Katie Barron, administratrix estate of Thomas Barron.” The judgment was rendered against these defendants in favor of the successor, G. W. Gentry, administrator and defendant in error. From this judgment Jack Hittson prosecutes this writ of error.
The judgment was had by default upon an amended petition.
The original petition described the cause of action, with other elements of description, as a promissory nóte for the sum of $4325, and with credits thereon as follows: $200 September 24, 1886; $434.95 November 1, 1886.
The amended petition on which judgment was taken described the cause of action as a promissory note for the sum of $4325, without credits.
Among other matters assigned as error (a discussion of which we waive, because unnecessary), the judgment is complained of as erroneous on account of the excess in the amount in the amended over that claimed in the original petition.
It is apparent that the plaintiff in error was not served with notice of the amended petition. It may well be apprehended that a defendant who would not resist a demand for $3690.05, due upon the cause of action as described here in the original petition, would strenuously contest a claim for $4325 as described in the amended petition. This difference, according to our calculation, was carried into the judgment rendered against the plaintiff in error.
The cause of action as set out in the amended petition was, we think, a new cause of action, and differed from that originally declared upon. The defendant Jack Hittson therefore was, in our opinion, entitled to notice of the amended petition. Without such notice he was deprived of the opportunity and the right to contest the demand, the validity of which was decreed against him. Such a judgment is erroneous. Morrison v. Walker, 22 Texas, 18; Stewart v. Anderson, 70 Texas, 598.

219197,Charles Scheuber & Co. v. W. T. Simmons,1893-03-30,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This is a garnishment proceeding, instituted on October 6, 1890, in the County Court of Wise County, by the appellants, Charles Scheuber & Co., as plaintiffs in garnishment, against the appellee, W. T. Simmons, defendant in garnishment. The trial, had before a jury, resulted on January 16, 1891, in a verdict and judgment discharging the garnishee.
The appellants were among the creditors of one Harry May, a liquor-dealer at Decatur, Texas. At the date of the trial their claim had been reduced to a judgment in the sum of $351.34.
On Monday, September 22, 1890, Harry May, for the purpose of securing certain creditors other than appellants, executed a deed in trust to W. T. Simmons, conveying his saloon and the goods and fixtures connected therewith. At the same time he furnished to W. T. Simmons $250 in money to enable the latter, in connection with funds to be secured from one Mr. Vance, to take out a retail liquor dealer’s license. This sum of $250 was in no way included in the trust deed, but.it was delivered to Simmons for the sole purpose of procuring the license referred to. This fund constitutes the subject of controversy herein.
The garnishee answered, denying indebtedness to May at the date of the service of the writ, or that he knew of any person who had in his possession effects belonging to him. He alleged, that at said date he held in his hands the sum of $250; that this sum was, on or about October 1, 1890, delivered to him by Harry May, and that before service of the writ, “ May agreed and directed that this respondent pay to the First National Bank of Decatur out of said money the sum of $50, the remainder to be apportioned among the creditors mentioned in said trust deed, and according to the distribution of the trust fund therein provided, which this respondent has done.”
This answer was controverted by appellants, and issues by them were accordingly tendered.
The sole evidence offered by appellee in support of these allegations was the testimony of a witness, Mr. Greathouse, manager of the First National Bank, as follows: “When I came into town Monday morning, and found that May had made the mortgage and had overdrawn for $46.60, I saw him and asked him why he had done so, and told him I wanted him to settle the overdraft at once. He told me that he had paid W. T. Simmons $250 toward procuring license; that he had no other use for the money than to get the license, and that he was willing that Simmons should pay me out of the $250 the sum of $46.60 for the overdraft, and that the remainder of the $250 should be apportioned among the creditors named in the mortgage in which Simmons was trustee.”
In evident response to this testimony, the effect of which was quite emphatically contradicted by May and other witnesses for appellants, the court gave to the jury a charge which appellants appropriately assign as error, and which is as follows:
“If you find that prior to the service of said writ of garnishment on defendant, that Harry May delivered to him $250 in money, and that he held said money when said writ was served, you will nevertheless find for defendant, unless you believe that the plaintiff has, by a preponderance of the evidence, shown that said May did not, at sometime prior to the service of said writ, agree with H. Greathouse, as the representative of the First National Bank, that said money might be paid to said bank and other creditors of May; and the burden is on plaintiff to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that no such agreement was made by said May.”
If the agreement referred to in the above instruction was made by May and accepted by Greathouse as an assignment to the latter of so much of the funds in Simmons’ hands as should be sufficient to pay the debt to Greathouse (admittedly the sum of $47.60), we do not think, that to operate as such an assignment, it was necessary that the garnishee, Simmons, should himself have been present thereat or privy thereto. If, however, the agreement was in the nature purely of a negotiation not intended as a final contract by the parties, it could not operate as such an assignment. What the intent was should have been left to the determination of the jury under the evidence.
The effect of this agreement, however, whatever the intention may have been, could not extend to the creditors referred to in the charge, because they were in no sense parties to the agreement. It does not appear that they were present, nor is there any intimation in the record, as we read it, that Mr. Greathouse represented them. Unless they knew and assented to the assignment, if indeed it was such, May, the supposed assignor, could not be held, so far as they were concerned who were entire strangers to the arrangement, to have placed the funds beyond his control. Drake on Attach., sec. 525. The instruction is therefore manifestly erroneous.
The charge is further criticised, because it places the burden of proof on the plaintiffs with reference to the issues tendered. In this connection we deem it sufficient, in view of another trial, to call attention to the following language of our Supreme Court in Railway v. Terry, 50 Texas, 134: “In a proceeding of this character [a garnishment proceeding], the creditor is the actor, and the burden of proof is undoubtedly upon him; and unless he establishes the truth of his averments impeaching the answer of the garnishee, the latter must unquestionably be discharged. The garnishee is primarily required to stand merely upon the defensive. Hence it is not incumbent upon him to establish the truth of his answer,, but simply to repel the efforts of the creditor to impeach it.”
For the 'error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause is-remanded.
Reversed and remanded.

216278,H. H. Swank v. San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company,1892-12-07,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
This suit was instituted by appellant, on the 2nd day of February, 1889, in the District Court of Karnes County, Texas, upon a written live stock contract, which was made a part of appellant’s petition, to recover from appellee the sum $1200 damages to 109 .head of stock, which appellee received from appellant on May 11, 1888, at Beeville, Texas, to be transported by appellee over its line of railway from said Beeville to Junction City, Kansas, under said written live stock ■contract.
Appellee answered, and admitted that the stock mentioned were shipped under said written live stock contract, but set up that its line of railway on said route only extended to the city of San Antonio, Texas, and contended that by the terms of said written live stock contract its liability as a common carrier ceased upon the transportation of said stock to San Antonio; and that the injuries and damages to said stock resulted while the stock was in possession of another carrier.
The case being tried by the court without the intervention of a jury, judgment was rendered for appellee against appellant.
1. On the lltli day of May, 1888, appellant and appellee entered into the following contract of shipment of the stock in controversy:
“ THE SAN ANTONIO & ARANSAS PASS RAILWAY COMPANY.
“ Rules and Regulations for the Transportation of Live Stock.
“ No station master of this company has any power or authority to bind this company in regard to shipment of live stock except by written •contract, in the following form; neither has such station master power or authority to agree to furnish cars to be loaded with live stock, at any particular time, or to agree to furnish, under any circumstances, any particular class or kind of cars.
“ Live stock will be taken in less than carload lots between points within the State of Texas at the rate of one-half of 1 cent per 100 pounds, actual weight, per mile, the rate in no instance to be less than 30 cents per 100 pounds. Between other points, the rates on less than carload shipments will be subject to the charge for estimated weights as provided by joint Texas classification in its application to interstate business.
“ The San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company will not assume any liability over the actual value, and in no case exceeding 8100 per head on horses and valuable stock, except by special agreement.
“ For the purpose of taking care of stock, the owner or men in charge, in proportion to the number of cars, as endorsed hereon, will be passed on the train with it, and all persons thus passed are at their own risk of any personal injury whatever, and will agree to sign release to that effect endorsed on the contract.
“ LIVE STOCK CONTRACT.

H. Swank at Junction City station; and the party of the first part covenants and agrees that the freight charge from point of shipment to final destination shall be only the sum of-dollars per carload, the same being a through rate lower than the local rates which might be lawfully charged by party of the first part, and for and in consideration of which through rate and the guaranty thereof by the party of the first part, the party of the second part hereby covenants and agrees as follows:
“ First. That he does hereby release said first party from any and all liability for delay in shipping said stock after delivery thereof to its agent, and from any delay in receiving«same after being tendered to its agent.

“ Third. That the party of the second part will load, unload, and reload said stock at his own risk, and feed, water, and attend to the same at his own expense and risk while it is in the stock yards of the party of the first part awaiting shipment, and while on cars, or at feeding or transfer points, or where it may be unloaded for any purpose.
“ Fourth.» That party of the second part will see that said stock are securely placed in the cars furnished, and that the cars are safely and properly fastened so as to prevent the escape of said stock therefrom.
‘ ‘ Fifth. That in case the party of the first part shall furnish laborers to assist in loading and unloading said stock at any point, such laborers shall be subject to the orders of the person representing the shipper in charge of said stock, and shall be deemed employes of the party of the second part while so assisting.
“ Sixth. That in case the party of the first part should for any reason undertake to water and feed said stock, .it shall not be liable for insufficient supplies nor the imperfect discharge of said undertaking, it being expressly understood that the same is not a duty imposed upon it as a carrier of said stock.
“ Seventh. And the party of the second part further agrees, that as a condition precedent to his right to recover any damages for any loss or injury to said stock, he, or his agent, the person in charge of said stock, shall give notice in writing of his claim therefor, and the full amount of such loss or damage, to the station agent of the party of the first part at the station hereinbefore named as the end of the line of the party of the first part, before said stock is removed from station, and before said stock is mingled with other stock or delivered to any connecting line of railway.
“ Eighth. It is further stipulated and agreed between the parties hereto, that, as the live stock mentioned herein is to be transported over the road or roads of other railway companies and in other cars than those of this company, and as the party of the first part is only to transport said stock to the aforesaid station named as the end of its line on the route over which said stock is to be shipped, the party of the first part is only to be bound for the transportation of said stock to said station; it being understood and agreed by both parties hereto that the only purpose of making this contract is, that the party of the first part shall transport said stock to said station and protect the through rate of freight named herein for the benefit of the party of the second part; and the party of the first part shall in no manner be responsible for any loss or injuries occurring to said stock after the same has left the line of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company, nor be responsible for the carriage beyond.

“ Tenth. The second party further agrees, for the consideration aforesaid, that in case of total loss of any of said stock from any cause for which the carrier will be liable to pay for the same, the actual cash value at the time and place of shipment, but in no case to exceed $100 per head, shall be taken and deemed as full compensation therefor; and in case of injury or partial loss the amount of damage to be recovered shall be in the same proportion. And in the event of any proceeding in court to recover damages upon this shipment, said actual cash value at the time and place of shipment and not at the place of destination shall control the court and jury in estimating, the amount which may be due to the shipper.
“ Eleventh. This contract does not entitle the holder or other parties to ride in the cars of any train except the train in which his stock referred to is drawn or taken. Neither does it entitle him (and the party of the second part, named in this contract, so expressly stipulates, admits, and agrees) to return passage from Junction City, Kansas, unless this said contract is presented within twenty days from the date hereof; and that no person except the party of the second part, and parties who accompany him in charge of said stock for the purpose of assisting him in taking care of same, as specified in and upon said contract, and does not include women, infants, or other persons unable to do and perform the services required of parties in charge, as expressed on this contract, shall be entitled to such return passage within the said twenty days; the object, purpose, and intent of the return passage being to enable the said party of the second part hereto, or his men in charge, as expressed in contract, and no other person, to return to Beeville, Texas, thereon at any time within twenty days from date hereof, and not thereafter.

2. The line of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company, on the route from Beeville, Texas, to Junction City, Kansas, terminated at San Antonio, Texas.
3. The injuries and damage to the stock occurred at Taylor, Texas, on the line of the International & Great Northern Railway Company, a line of railway on the route from Beeville, Texas, to Junction City, Kansas.
4. The amount of damages sustained by appellant is the sum of $1090.
The appellant contends that the court erred in permitting evidence to be introduced, over his objection, to the effect that San Antonio, Texas, is the terminus of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway, for the reason that the contract of shipment names Junction City, Kansas, as the station at the end of the line of railway operated by appellee, and that the effect of such evidence would be to vary and change the terms of the written contract; and that the court erred in giving such effect to the contract as would terminate the liability of appellee at San Antonio, Texas, and in not holding it liable under the contract for damages resulting on the entire line of route from Beeville, Texas, to Junction City, Kansas.
These are the main questions in the case, although others are suggested by assignments of error, which we will not notice, as not necessary to a disposition of the case.
The court below, in admitting evidence showing that San Antonio, Texas, was the terminus of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway, evidently regarded, from the entire range of all the provisions of the contract of shipment, that the terminal point of that railway was uncertain as gathered front the contract, and that in this respect the contract was ambiguous, and that such testimony was admissible as tending to give it certainty.
If the contract in this respect is uncertain, the evidence was admissible; and the court properly construed the contract, as such evidence would not have the effect of changing the terms of the contract, but simply gives effect to its terms and renders that certain which was otherwise uncertain. If there is no uncertainty in the contract in this respect, the evidence was not admissible, and the court erred in its construction of the contract.
By reference to the contract, it will be seen that it provides that the horses are to be shipped from Beeville station to “Junction City, Kansas, the end of the line of road operated by the party of the first part [the appellee] on the route over which such stock are way-billed, there to be transferred to the railway company over which said live stock are way-billed for further transportation by said railway company, the stock being way-billed through and consigned to H. H. Swank at Junction City station.” This is the provision of the contract that appellant contends fixes Junction City, Kansas, as the terminal point on appellee’s line of road.
The eighth and ninth subdivisions of the contract of shipment are as follows:
“ Eighth. It is further stipulated and agreed between the parties hereto, that as the live stock mentioned herein is to be transported over the road or roads of other railway companies and in other cars than in those of this company, and as the party of the first part is only to transport said stock to the aforesaid station named as the end of its line on the route over which said stock is to be shipped, the party of the first part is only to be bound for the transportation of said stock to said station; it being understood and agreed by both parties hereto that the only purpose of making this contract is, that the party of the first part shall transport said stock to said station and protect the through rate of freight named herein for the benefit of the party of the second part; and the party of the first part shall in no manner be responsible for any loss or injuries occurring to said stock after the same has left the line of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company, nor to be responsible for the carriage beyond.
“ Ninth. It is further expressly agreed by the party of the second part, that the other railway lines over which said stock is way-billed in order to reach their destination, having participated in making said through rate of freight, of which the party of the second part has the benefit hereunder, when they receive said stock for transportation under this contract shall, like the party of the first part, not be responsible for injuries or loss occurring beyond their respective lines of road.”
It is seen by these provisions of the contract, that it is expressly agreed that the stock is to be shipped over lines of road other than that owned or controlled by appellee, and that appellee shall in no manner be responsible for any loss or injuries occurring to said stock after the same has left the line of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Kailway Company, nor responsible for carriage beyond.
Delivered December 7, 1892.
It is not questioned but that Junction City, Kansas, was the final destination of the stock shipped.
It is evident, from the two provisions of the contract last quoted, that the stock, in order to reach their final destination, would have to pass over roads other than those owned or controlled by appellee. If such was not the case, why these provisions of the contract that in effect so provide ? If the stock was to be carried through on the line of road owned or controlled by appellee, then these provisions of the contract are out of place, and express a fact that is not true, and provide for a contingency that in no possible event could in the nature of things occur. We can not assume that the parties to this contract intended that these provisions should not be given a meaning as well as other parts of the contract; and it is our duty in construing the contract to view it as a whole and give it such meaning as will best effectuate the intention of the parties to the instrument.
That provision of the contract stating that Junction City, Kansas, is the end of the line of road operated by appellee is evidently inconsistent with those provisions of the contract stating that the stock must go over other lines of road in order to reach their destination — that is, Junction City. This inconsistency does not produce such an uncertainty as would render the contract void, but we think effect can be given to all of its provisions, and it can be explained upon the hypothesis that Junction City was simply named in the contract of through shipment as the place of final destination of the stock, and that appellee should not be responsible for damages resulting beyond the terminus of its own line, which is shown by the evidence to be San Antonio, Texas.
We find no error in the record, and affirm the judgment of the court below.

This case went off on demurrer. Appellant, a corporation chartered in Illinois, sued the trustees of a school district in Clay County on a promissory note executed by their predecessors, under the school law of 1884, for school furniture for said district; alleging that the furniture was necessary, and that the school community continued to use it, etc., and praying in the alternative to recover on a quantum meruit.
We are of opinion that the law did not authorize the trustees to bind the school district in the manner alleged, and that appellant’s only remedy was to recover the furniture.

219195,E. S. Day v. R. H. Needham et al.,1893-03-30,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This appeal is from a verdict and judgment depriving appellant of a section of land situated in Denton County, patented to the heirs of William Wallace. The verdict is sustained by the evidence in establishing the conclusion, that the title to the land in controversy had been vested in appellees (about which there is no dispute here), and that they were entitled to recover, unless the adverse possession of appellant under a tax deed, which was excluded from the evidence, had the effect of defeating that title. If this deed was not admissible for any of the purposes for which it was offered, the judgment must be affirmed, otherwise it must be reversed. The following is a plat of the survey as described in the patent and in that part of the tax collector’s deed which immediately follows the conveying clause, though in the first part of the deed, where the levy under the tax roll is recited, instead of calling for a north course from the southwest corner, the call, evidently by mistake, is to run west 552 varas instead of north:
The deed was excluded on the ground that such an element of uncertainty in the description of the land was introduced by the expression, after setting out the field notes, “ less 60 acres out of the southwest corner of same,” as to render the deed void. Appellant offered to prove in connection with the deed, that the extreme southwest and northwest corners of this survey could be found distinctly marked upon the ground as it had been originally run and established, and that the distance between these marked and well defined points was in reality 587 varas, instead of 552 varas, as called for in the field notes.
The contention of appellant is, that the 60 acres should be taken in a rectangular form out of the southwest corner of the survey, and hence that the deed on its face was sufficiently certain as a predicate for his five years adverse possession. This construction of the deed seems to us the natural and reasonable one. Several cases hold that a deed which conveys a definite quantity of land to be taken out of a specified corner will be sustained when it can be taken in a square. Smith v. Nelson (Mo.), 19 S. W. Rep., 734; Doe v. Clayton (Ala.), 2 So. Rep., 31; Green v. Jordan (Ala.), 3 Am. State Rep., 711.
It seems to us, that the principle upon which these cases rest requires that the 60 acres, which can not on the face of the deed in question be taken in a square, should be taken in that other form of rectangle, to-wit, an oblong, with the west boundary as a base line. The contour of the survey indicates this as the obvious intention of the grantor in the deed. It would seem also, if this construction be incorrect, that as the uncertainty would relate only to the west limb of the survey, and not to its main trunk, the deed would be admissible in support of the adverse possession of the latter part of the survey. Such a principle of construction seems to have been applied by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin to the description of a tract of land lying upon the east and west sides of a creek, the uncertainty of the description relating solely to the portion on the west side of the creek. Scheiber v. Koehler, 49 Wis., 291.
The rule adopted in this State in passing upon the sufficiency of a tax deed to support the defense of five years limitation seems to be, that the description is sufficient if, unaided by extrinsic facts, it satisfies the mind that the land adversely occupied is embraced within the description contained in the deed. If so, the owner is notified that his possession has been invaded. Brokel v. McKechnie, 69 Texas, 32; McDonald v. Hamblin, 78 Texas, 628; Harber v. Dyches, 14 S. W. Rep., 580. It seems to us, from the description contained in this deed, without the aid of extrinsic evidence, that the land which it purports to convey can be found and identified with reasonable certainty; hence the second contention, that the oral testimony offered rendered the deed admissible, need not be considered. Overand v. Menczer, 83 Texas, 122. This conclusion leads to a reversal of the judgment.
The cause will be remanded for a new trial on the issues of limitation and valuable improvements', which were not submitted to the jury on the former trial; but the issues submitted and passed upon will not be reopened. McConnell v. Wall, 67 Texas, 352; 65 Texas, 397.

216270,Alamo Mills Company v. Hercules Iron Works,1892-12-07,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
The Hercules Iron Works, the appellee, brought this suit May 17,1889, against the Alamo Mills Company, now known as the Crystal Ice Manufacturing Company, and by an amended petition, filed January 10, 1890, alleged, that on the 26tli day of December, 1887, plaintiff entered into an agreement with defendant for the purpose of erecting an icé plant, consisting of two parts, with a daily capacity of forty tons of clear ice, to be produced from condensed steam, one half to be ready by March 1 and the other half to be ready by April 1, 1888, for which said Alamo Mills Company agreed to pay the sum of $13,485, the sum of $6000 to be paid when the first twenty-ton plant had been run fifteen days and demonstrated its ability to perform the work mentioned, and the balance to be paid after a like trial of the second plant of twenty tons, and its satisfactory performance of the work agreed upon for it.
That said plant was to be turned over in good order and condition by plaintiff to defendant, and if anything was necessary to the production of the forty tons of clear ice per day it was to be furnished by plaintiff without charge.
The petition further avers, “that plaintiff complied with its contract in every particular, furnished the machinery of the contract power, with the materials as agreed, and of the quality stipulated, and in every particular complied with its contract, with the exception that, owing to unforeseen circumstances, and the misconduct of defendants .in refusing to furnish labor and material for making ice when the plant was ready, plaintiff did not have the plants producing ice until a few weeks after the date agreed upon; but plaintiff saved defendant from whatever loss it might have incurred thereby, and now is and always has been ready and willing to pay defendant whatever loss it sustained by reason of plaintiff not having the plant in operation on April 1, 1888, if in equity it should; and that when said plant was completed it was turned over to defendant in good order and condition. That defendant continually threw obstacles in the way of plaintiff in completing said plant, and prevented plaintiff making the tests agreed, and expressed at different times its satisfaction with the plant, and though often requested, refused, etc., to plaintiff’s damage $13,813.18 and interest from April 1, 1888.”
The petition further states, that after the plant was turned over to defendant and plaintiff’s workmen had returned to their homes (in Chicago), defendant “grossly mistreated the plant,” and used it so negligently that it was greatly impaired and became worthless, when defendant instructed plaintiff to repair the same, which it did, at an expense and cost for labor and material of the value of $1404, as shown by itemized account.
That after the contract, defendant instructed plaintiff to make the plant more solid and complete, and that defendant would pay therefor; that plaintiff did, as directed, make such improvements (not required to the production of forty tons of clear ice per day), of the reasonable value as set out in bill of particulars. The total of both accounts, beside the amount due on the first contract, amounts to $4262.79.
Prayer for judgment for amounts due as alleged.
Defendant filed general demurrer; and specially excepted to the sufficiency of the allegations in the petition that defendant obstructed the performance of the contract in time, without stating the facts constituting such obstructions.
Defendant also filed a general denial and a number of special answers:
1. A plea in reconvention for $80,000, loss of profits resulting from plaintiff’s failure to furnish and construct the ice factory of the capacity agreed on, and from delay in erecting the same, the $80,000 being the loss of. profits that would have been made during the season of 1888.
2. Plea in reconvention for $14,000, the alleged rental value of the premises for the year, lost by plaintiff’s failure to perform the contract.
3. To recover $7000, rent of the machinery and premises as they were before plaintiff undertook to put in the new machinery, lost by plaintiff’s alleged failure.
4. To recover $6000 paid plaintiff on the contract, under the belief that it would be completed, and showing that there was no alternative left defendant but to take charge of the machinery as left by plaintiff and to utilize it to the best advantage.
5. Plea of payment and setoff, $8502.82.
6. To recover loss incurred by defendant in furnishing one Kampman ice, pursuant to a contract made with him by defendant — a special loss to defendant resulting from plaintiff’s failure.
Other matters of defense were set up.
The case was tried by a jury; there was a verdict and judgment rendered thereon for the plaintiff for $6825, with interest from June 30, 1888, at 8 per cent per annum. Plaintiff entered a remittitur of $2450 as rent of the plant from March 1, to June 30, 1888, leaving, as stated in the order of remittitur, a judgment against defendant for $4375, and interest from June 30, 1888, at 8 per cent per annum.
Defendant appealed.
The contract to furnish and construct the plant by plaintiff, and defendant’s agreement to pay for it, was in writing and is as follows:
“San Antonio, Texas, December 26th, 1887.
“ Agreement made between the Hercules Iron Works of Chicago, and the Alamo Mills Company of San Antonio. <
“ The Hercules Iron Works hereby agree to furnish an ice-making plant complete, with a daily capacity of forty tons of ice, the same to include two tanks, with all coils, valves, pumps, distilling apparatus, filter, air pump, water coolers, charcoal filters, machinery for small water wheel, necessary change in the steam engine, well, condenser house, insulation, and all wood work connected with the plant, etc.
“One-half of the plant to be ready March 1, the second half by April 1, the same to be transferred to the Alamo Mills Company in complete working order for the sum of $13,485 and the cost of the freezing cans.
“The plant is to be two complete twenty-ton plants, capable of producing forty tons of clear ice per day.
“ The Alamo Mills Company agree to pay all railroad freight on goods shipped to them by the Hercules Iron Works; to pay for the freezing cans when requested so to do by the Hercules Iron Works; to pay when the first twenty-ton plant has been run fifteen days and demonstrates its ability to perform the work mentioned, the sum of $6000; and to pay the balance, say $7485, after a like trial of the second plant of twenty tons and its satisfactory performance of the work agreed upon.
“ Further, the Hercules Iron Works hereby guarantees that this plant will not require more than one hundred pounds, say $50 worth, of ammonia per month after the first charge has been put in; also guaranteeing the material and workmanship of the highest order; also that forty tons of ice from condensed steam can be made daily with this plant, with an expenditure of McAlester coal, or its equivalent, not exceeding six and a half tons.
“It is understood that this plant is to be complete in every respect; that it is to be turned over by the Hercules Iron Works in good order and condition; and if anything is necessary to the production of forty tons of clear ice per day by this plant, and has not been mentioned herein, it will be furnished without charge by the Hercules Iron Works.
“Alamo Mills Company, J. S. Lockwood, President.
“Hercules Iron Works, Chas. A. McDonald, President.”
The first error assigned is addressed to action of the court in overruling defendant’s special exceptions to the averment charging defendant with obstructing the completion of the plant, without stating the facts constituting the obstructions.
We think that the allegation is too general and is subject to the special exception.
The plaintiff assumed the burden of showing that its admitted delay in completing the plant in the time required by the contract was owing to something done by defendant. The allegation should have stated what was done — what the obstructions were. Defendant had the right to know, by proper pleading, what acts or omissions it was charged with that interfered with the plaintiff in carrying out its agreement, so as to prepare such defense as there might be to the charge.
Neither the court nor the defendant could know what facts would be relied upon to sustain the charge, or what was intended to be proved to show that defendant had obstructed the completion of the plant in time. Defendant alleged that time was of the essence of the contract. This was reasonable, considering the purpose.
Plaintiff, anticipating this, attempted to excuse itself and make defendant responsible for the failure to comply with the contract in time. It should have stated the facts imposing' this responsibility upon defendant, and not the mere conclusion. This rule of pleading is elementary. Thompson v. Munger, 15 Texas, 523; Ellis v. Singletary, 45 Texas, 27; Caldwell v. Haley, 3 Texas, 317; Morrison v. Ins. Co., 69 Texas, 353.
The allegation that the delay was caused by misconduct of defendant in refusing to furnish labor and material for making ice, was vague and unsatisfactory, and was only sufficient to admit under it the character of proof indicated, and it would be so limited. But clearly, if not allowed under this, no proof could be admitted under the allegation to which the exception was taken showing defendant’s responsibility for the delay.
The court erred as stated in the assignment.
The record in this case is very voluminous, and there are some forty or more assignments of error presented in appellant’s brief, some of which need not be separately considered. A decision upon one of a group will be sufficient to determine the rest. For example, all the evidence predicated upon the foregoing allegation objected to by defendant was improperly admitted, and the assignments of error thereto will be sustained without further notice. When the petition is amended, as it probably will be before another trial, such errors will not occur.
It is insisted by appellant that the court erred in sustaining plaintiff’s exceptions to that part of the answer which set up loss of profits that would have been realized during the ice season from the 1st of March to the 1st of November, 1888, if plaintiff had furnished the plant for manufacturing ice in the time, of the power, and of the kind to produce the quality of ice stipulated in the contract.
That part of the answer set up, that defendant, as a corporation to manufacture ice in San Antonio, was, prior to the contract with plaintiff, extensively engaged in the manufacture of ice, and as such had a large and established trade that required forty tons of ice per day; that it owned and used for its business a valuable factory for producing ice, consisting of site, buildings, machinery, in San Antonio, of the value of $75,000, and it had contracted with one Kampman to deliver him 1000 tons of ice, by written contract (set out in full), for the consideration of $9000, to be delivered to him at the door of its factory in amounts as called for, not to exceed ten tons per day, delivery to begin on April 1, 1888, or if the mills should be running before that date, then the ice to be called for before said date at any time when the mills were in full operation; the contract dated December 3, 1887. That the principal season for selling ice in San Antonio begins the first of March and ends the first of November of each year. That the trade of defendant demanded a machine that would manufacture forty tons of ice daily. That with the view to meet the demands of its trade, and to carry out its contract, it became necessary to increase the capacity of its plant, to remove parts of its machinery and improve with other machinery, as advised by plaintiff, which machinery plaintiff proposed to furnish, and to effect such ends it entered into the contract with plaintiff on the 26th day of December, 1887, which is herein before set out in full. The legal effect of and obligation of plaintiff under the contract are then set out. It is then further alleged that the machines contracted for were manufactured solely by plaintiff, and defendant could not purchase them in any other market (the Chicago market).
That after the time for the completion of the machines by the contract, there was not time to procure other machinery and get the same in operation to produce ice for the season of 1888. That at the time of the contract, and before the first of March, plaintiff had notice of all the facts set out, and the contract was made with knowledge by the parties, and with reference to such facts, that by the agreement and the circumstances the time for the delivery of the machinery, tested and completed, was made of the essence of the contract; that though often demanded, plaintiff wholly failed to furnish the plants contracted for that would produce forty tons of clear ice per day; that pretending to comply with the contract, plaintiff furnished a machine that would not produce more than twenty tons per day, and that of an inferior and unmarketable quality; and this was not furnished until June 1, 1888. That the cost of operating it was greater than agreed, in labor, fuel, and ammonia. That during the delay defendant’s machine was idle. That the ice factories in San Antonio could not supply the demands of their trades, and defendant could not purchase ice in San Antonio to supply its trade, and on account of the cost of shipment ice could not be purchased elsewhere and brought to San Antonio and sold at a profit. That by reason of plaintiff’s failure to furnish the plant contracted for, defendant could not make and dispose of forty tons of ice per day. That ice was worth in San Antonio during each day of the season $10 per ton, and the cost of making ice on the machine agreed to be furnished by plaintiff, during the season, would have been only $1.50 per ton, whereby, by plaintiff’s failure to perform its contract, defendant has been damaged, etc.
The court below sustained plaintiff’s exception to so much of this answer as set up loss of profits as the measure of damages.
The right or not to recover profits for a breach of a contract does not depend upon an arbitrary rule to be adopted by a court, but upon the principles that should control the right. The law does not condemn profits as such as a measure of damages. The question is, would the loss of profits be the direct result of the breach, and would such loss “ reasonably be supposed to have entered into the contemplation of the parties at. the time of making the contract?” Conjectural profits would not be allowed, not for the reason that profits are proscribed, but because they are uncertain; if they become sufficiently certain, are the direct result of the breach, and the parties were in possession of such facts as would charge them, as reasonably intelligent men, with the probable consequences of the breach, then profits fall within the rule, and may be recoverable as damages. Griffin v. Colver, 16 N. Y., 489; 2 Suth. on Dam., 401, 402, et seq.; Railway v. Hill, 63 Texas, 381; Jones v. George, 61 Texas, 345; 1 Sedg. on Dam., sec. 192.
Speculative damages are not allowed, whether of profits or other results. Expected profits in business are generally too uncertain and remote. But every case will depend upon its own facts. In this case, we think the allegations of expected profits from the manufacture and sale of ice during the season would not be a sufficiently reliable and certain basis for estimating the damages for failure to furnish the plant according to the contract; but the profits that would have been made on'the Kampman contract may be recovered if proved as alleged. The allegation makes them ascertainable from elements known to the parties at the time the contract was made. Plaintiff, represented by McDonald, its president, knew that defendant had made the contract with Kampman to furnish him 1000 tons of ice for $9000 paid, as well as the terms of the same as to time of delivery; he, McDonald, knew all the conditions; that the plant lie agreed to furnish would be relied on to make this ice; he knew, it is alleged, the cost of production of ice on his proposed machinery, $1.50 per ton, and that there was to be no further expense on the part of defendant, as the ice was to be delivered at the factory door. It seems that there can be no doubt but that the profits ascertainable from the contract were in contemplation of the parties when they made the contract sued on. The contract sued on was made with special reference to the Kampman contract, and that defendant would be entitled to profits to be had on the latter until it was completed during the time of the alleged delay. The general profits expected from the business lack the necessary elements of certainty of computation; the parties may have supposed there would be profits in the business, yet the amount could not have been reasonably determined, owing to the fluctuations of the market price, and other con-' siderations. The price was fixed for the amount of ice to be delivered to Kampman.
We conclude that there was error in sustaining plaintiff’s exception to so much of the answer as set up profits on the Kampman contract as damages for the alleged breach. This conclusion will also apply to the ruling of the court in sustaining plaintiff’s exceptions to the sixth count in the answer, which sets up actual loss on the part of defendant in procuring ice at great expense for the Kampman contract. The cost of supplying the ice above what it would have cost if plaintiff had furnished the machinery contracted for would be the measure of damages, provided defendant exercised ordinary care in procuring ice for Kampman.
The court did not err in the charge to the effect that defendant could not recover rent for the time the construction was delayed if defendant had waived the time of performance of the contract. The assignment is, that there was no pleading or testimony to authorize the charge. The pleading might have been made more definite, but we think the point is sufficiently pleaded to admit testimony thereunder. Without intimating any opinion as to the weight of the testimony, we conclude that it was not improper to submit the issue. There was some testimony that the delay was caused by the attempted use of the Tainter process of producing steam, and that defendant consented to the trial of it. Defendant told Tainter that it would make him a present of $100 if he succeeded with the system. There are some other circumstances in proof which have a tendency to establish the proposition submitted in the charge, which the jury might have considered. It is not our province to determine the effect of the testimony offered; that was for the jury. We can determine the competency and admissibility of testimony and whether there was testimony or not, but its weight is left to the jury.
We are not prepared to say that there was testimony sufficient to warrant the court’s charge as to defendant’s liability for Tainter’s services. He was employed by plaintiff, was in charge of the work, and was allowed to experiment with his system of using steam made in a vacuum — a cheap process if it could have been utilized in making ice; and it may be the defendant consented to the trial of its use. But defendant was not to construct the machine or be in charge of the work, and we are unable to find the testimony which shows that defendant was to pay for any part of Tainter’s time before he left, in June. When he returned, in 1889, to run the plant and to test its capacity, he was employed by defendant, but that is not the time in question.
Plaintiff was required to furnish the plant and put it in working order, with certain ice-producing power, for a price stipulated, and which price is o sued for. While Tainter was working to accomplish this result, he was in plaintiff’s employ, and there could be no extra charge for his services.
The item of charge for Tainter’s services is: “ S. B. Tainter’s time, furnished defendant by plaintiff at defendant’s request, from May 20 to June 20, 1888, thirty days, at $15 per day, $450.” McDonald, plaintiff’s president, testified that Tainter’s services were for defendant’s benefit, but that defendant did not request them.
The allegation was not sustained by the proof.
In regard to McDonald’s time, traveling expenses, etc., made an item m plaintiff’s account, we may say that defendant would not be liable for it if rendered for the plaintiff company in complying with its contract to furnish and construct the plant, as required by the written contract. If, however, the contract had been fully complied with, and he rendered other services under the alleged distinct verbal contract (if there was any in fact upon which defendant would be liable), if the charge was reasonable, defendant would be liable.
In regard to the item for 1 ‘ Davis’ time, labor, and traveling expenses, from August 11 to September 25, inclusive, $732;” if the plaintiff had completed its contract to furnish the plant according to its terms, and defendant took charge of it, and while operating it, it was injured and impaired by negligent use of defendant, and upon request of defendant that plaintiff should repair it, Davis was sent by plaintiff to make the repairs, and did render the service as alleged, defendant would be liable for the reasonable value thereof; but if the plant was not fully completed according to contract, and defendant had not accepted the work as a full performance, and Davis was sent by plaintiff to make the machine operate according to the terms of the original contract, or if plaintiff was still bound to so complete its contract, defendant would not be liable for work and material so furnished.
In presenting the case to the jury, the distinction should be observed between the duty of plaintiff to fully comply with its contract, and for any extra material and labor, furnished upon request of defendant, or necessitated by the defendant’s misuse of the machine after its completion or its acceptance as completed by defendant. Whatever work or expense may have been incurred by plaintiff in performing its contract or making it good according to its terms (unless waived by defendant) was provided for in the original contract, and its price fixed, and no extra charge could be made for any of it. But if extra work and material were furnished after the plant had been completed according to contract and delivered to defendant, they would be a proper charge if declared on.
The memoranda of articles and prices made prior to the contract, and furnished by McDonald as estimated cost of the plant, allowed to be read by plaintiff, was improperly admitted in evidence, unless defendamt had before offered some part of its contents. The contract itself was the final depository of the agreement of the parties, which could not be changed or modified by contemporaneous estimates or negotiations. Milliken v. Callahan County, 69 Texas, 210.
There was no ambiguity or uncertainty in the written contract; no fraud or mistake that authorized the introduction of the memoranda. 2 Whart. on Cont., 665.
Appellant assigns as error the refusal of the court to give the following requested charge:
“ The jury are instructed that if they believe from the evidence that the machinery furnished by plaintiff was not tested by running same fifteen days and producing forty tons of ice per day, as provided in the contract, then plaintiff can not recover the contract price of same, unless you find from the evidence that defendant accepted same as being of the .capacity called for in the contract; but if you believe that plaintiff did erect machinery which did not comply with the contract, and if you further believe from the evidence that defendant has taken possession of and used the same, then defendant must be charged with the reasonable value of the machine instead of the one contracted for.”
Some such charge should have been given. If the machine was not of contract capacity, and it was left on defendant’s hands, and it did not accept it as a compliance with the contract, it should not be required to pay the contract price for it, but the price it was reasonably worth — that is, the contract price, less the damages for deficiency, which would be the difference between the agreed price and the value of the machine left on its hands.
The court, over the objection of defendant, permitted McDonald, the president of plaintiff company, to testify that Lockwood, president of defendant company,.told him, about the last of May or first of June, 1888, that he (Lockwood) was satisfied with the machine, and that it was not necessary to make a test. The contract required a test of fifteen days running of the machine to demonstrate its ability to perform the work agreed. Lockwood might have accepted the plant without the test. 1-Ie could waive the test. The testimony was admissible.
There was no error in permitting the witness Davis to testify that the records of the plant, kept by the engineer while being run by defendant, showed an abuse of it. The record gave the amount of ice drawn each day from June 29 to August 12, 1888, and the starting and the closing temperatures for each day. It was in proof that the machine could not be run successfully unless the temperature was considerably below the freezing point, and that a higher temperature indicated that more ice was being drawn from the machine than it was able to manufacture. Davis was allowed to state that the record of temperature 'showed that more ice was drawn than the machine could properly freeze, and that the tank was being robbed. ■ He was qualified to testify as an expert. There was no error in admitting his opinion on the issue of defendant having impaired the machine by negligent use.
Delivered December 7, 1892.
There are a number of assignments of error that we have not specially noticed; but most of them have been disposed of, indirectly at least. We have sufficiently indicated our opinion of the rights and liabilities of the parties, and of the questions raised, to obviate error on another trial.
Some questions are necessarily eliminated by this decision in approving some portions of defendant’s pleas that were stricken out below.
The right of defendant to claim profits as limited herein for the alleged breach of plaintiff’s contract, need not create any confusion upon the subject of its right to rent, or the value of the use of the machine to be furnished in case there was a breach as alleged. Of course it is not intended that it could have a double recovery. There could be no rent for such part of the power of the machine as would be employed in supplying the Kampman contract during the time of delivery thereunder, profits being allowed under that contract; but rent would be the measure of damages for the balance of the power of the machine not so employed during the time of delay,, if it should appear that the delay was a breach of the contract.
We are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is so ordered.
Reversed and remanded."
219202,J. J. Hoffman v. Cleburne Building and Loan Association et al.,1893-03-30,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
The decision of our Supreme Court on the question referred to it by us holds, that a plea to the jurisdiction of the trial court on the ground that the amount in controversy has been fraudulently stated, must be filed in the due order of pleading before an answer to the merits. The action of the court below in overruling the motion of appellant to strike out such plea interposed by appellees, after they had filed a general demurrer and general denial, must therefore be held error which will require a reversal of the judgment.
The allegations in appellant’s petition in the court below upon which he sought a recovery are, in substance, that on the-day of November, 1889, plaintiff was the owner and in possession of the following described property, to-wit, six bales of cotton of the value of $59 per bale. That the said defendants on said day did wrongfully, unlawfully, with force, and without the consent of plaintiff, seize and take all of said property from his possession, and convert it to their own use. The petition also alleges such taking to have been willful and with full knowledge, and claims both actual and exemplary damages. To sustain his allegations, appellant offered evidence tending to show, that in the spring of 1889 his father gave him the use of 20 acres of land, which was a part of his homestead, and that the cotton in controversy, except one bale, was raised on this land, and that at the time alleged appellees took it from his possession by virtue of an execution against L. Hoffman, the father of appellant.
Appellees answered by a general denial; and appellant contends, that in this state of the pleading the only issue in the case was that of possession.
This question of pleading, in a case strikingly similar, is so fully considered in Willis v. Hudson, 63 Texas, 678, that we shall not undertake to add anything to what is there said. We understand that case to hold, that if the cotton was placed in the name of appellant to hold for his father, with no intention that as between them the title should pass to the former, this can be shown under a general denial, even though the transaction may have been undertaken to defeat the creditors of the latter. In such case, the ownership of the cotton would be in the father, and the son’s possession would be the father’s possession, just as the servant’s possession is the master’s possession. But if the parties to this transaction really intended the title to the cotton to vest in the son as between them, and the appellees relied upon their right to defeat such transfer as being in fraud of their rights as creditors of the father, special pleading on their part would be required.
In submitting the case to the jury, the court instructed them, in general terms, if they found that plaintiff was the owner of any of the cotton at the time of the levy, to find in his favor for its value, otherwise to find for defendants; and under this charge the jury returned the following verdict: “ We, the jury, find in favor of the plaintiff actual damages in the sum of $59, with interest at 8 per cent per annum from the 5tli day of November, 1889. We, the jury, find no sum in favor of the plaintiff as exemplary damages. We, the jury, find that the amount in controversy was falsely and fraudulently stated by the plaintiff to be more than the sum of $200, for the purpose of giving this court jurisdiction of the case, and therefore we find for the defendant on his special plea setting up those facts.” Upon this verdict a straight judgment was rendered for the defendant. Under the decision of our Supreme Court, it will be necessary that this judgment be reversed and here rendered for appellant for $59 and interest thereon at 8 per cent from the 5th day of November. 1889, together with all costs of this court and the court below.
Appellant contends, that the verdict finding him not to be the owner of the remainder of the cotton can not be sustained by the evidence, but we can not agree with this. The evidence was undisputed, that one bale of the cotton was raised upon land rented by appellant from other parties than his father, and this is evidently the bale the jury allowed him. As to the cotton raised on L. Hoffman’s land, we think the verdict amply sustained.
The evidence shows that L. Hoffman had a large family, and owned only a small place with from 40 to 45 acres in cultivation. The 20 acres upon which this cotton was raised was all the land on that place cultivated in cotton that year. This cotton was cultivated and picked by L. Hoffman, aided by his other children as well as appellant, in the way we would expect to find it done had it belonged to him. Appellant was a minor, and had several acres of cotton on land rented from other parties. Of the cotton that had been sold prior to the levy, L. Hoffman had received by far the greater portion of the proceeds, ostensibly as a gift from Ms son. A witness who worked in the same field with appellant and his father while the crop was being cultivated, testified to several conversations with both of them, in which they agreed that the cotton on the father’s land belonged to him, and that on the rented land to appellant. The father was in debt beyond his ability to pay. So that without considering the statements of the father made in the absence of appellant, introduced for the purpose of contradiction, we think the circumstances amply sufficient to sustain the conclusion of the jury, that there was no intention as between father and son that this cotton should belong to the latter. We incline to think, that had we been trying the case in the court below, we would have arrived at the same conclusion.
We find no error in the rulings of the court below in the admission and rejection of evidence.
The assignment calling in question the action of the court below in refusing special charges requested by appellant is too general to authorize its consideration by us over the objection of appellees.. We think it would have been better had the court below been more specific in applying the law to the issues raised by the evidence, but we can not remand on this account, in the state of the record as presented to us, without extending to the assignments of error a degree of liberality denied in other cases.
Let the judgment of the court below be reversed and here rendered as indicated in this opinion.
Reversed and rendered.
Delivered March 30, 1893."
219219,Bacon and Graves et al. v. The State of Texas,1892-12-06,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
We adopt the findings of fact filed by the court below, except from finding 20 strike out the words, “ were not responsible parties,” and add to finding 23 the following: “ By the word ‘ protest,’ as used in this finding, is meant that the Treasurer of the State-had several times refused to accept this money, and at the time he received it in January, 1891, the parties paying fully understood that the State would contest their claim to this land, and the Treasurer did not-receive the money as a legal payment therefor.”
The subject matter of this controversy is 466 sections, or 298,240 acres-of land, situated in Scurry, Borden, and adjoining counties.
In 1873 the Houston & Texas Central Railway Company, for the purpose of locating its land certificates thereon, had a large amount of surveying done in Scurry, Borden, Howard, Kent, and Fisher Counties. This surveying was done by dividing large blocks of land into sections containing 640 acres each, as will be seen by reference to our conclusions of fact, and was done upon the ground in such way as might be regarded as work in the field. The surveying so done by said railway company embraced all of the land in controversy in this suit, but its right thereto-failed by reason of the land at that time being within what is known as the Texas & Pacific Railway Reservation.
On December 1,1882, E. M. Bacon and E. G. Graves made application-to the proper surveyor to survey for them a large part of this Houston & Texas Central Railway Company land, embracing that in controversy in this suit, which they desired to purchase under the Act of July 14, 1879,. amended March 11', 1881, which was generally known as the fifty-cent act.
The surveyor, instead of doing this work upon the ground, simply adopted the work which had previously been done by the railway company, and copied their field notes from the records in his office, and the field notes so obtained were returned by Bacon and Graves, as to the land in controversy, to the General Land Office within the time required by the law above cited. Bacon and Graves, at the time they returned the field notes, knew how the surveyor had obtained them, and that none of the work had been done in the field. The deputies of the surveyor, however, who appeared from the certificates to the field notes to have done this work, had previously been upon the ground in making other surveys, and had seen enough of the railway work to satisfy them of its correctness.
The act under which Bacon and Graves were attempting to acquire this land provides, that “Any person, firm, or corporation desiring to purchase any of the unappropriated lands herein set apart and reserved for sale, may do so by causing the tract or tracts which said person, firm, or corporation desire to purchase to be surveyed by the authorized public surveyor of the county or district in which said land is situated;” •and the question as to whether or not the obtaining of the field notes in the manner above set forth should be considered as their having had the land surveyed within the meaning of this act, constitutes the most important question for our decision in this case.
Prior to the adoption of our Revised Statutes, in prescribing the manner in which surveys were to be made, our law provided, that “The courses of the lines shall be determined by the magnetic needle, and care shall be taken to determine 'its variation from the pole in the district where the surveys are made. The surveys shall be made with great caution, with metallic chains made for the purpose, and care shall be taken that the place of beginning the survey of each parcel of land be established with certainty, taking the bearings and distances of two permanent objects at least.”
Under this law, at an early day, the practice became so common among surveyors to disregard its provisions, by making out field notes in their offices from data obtained otherwise than by work done upon the ground, that the courts in a great number of cases have felt constrained to hold that where the question was raised by subsequent locators, dr third parties adversely interested, such acts on the part of the surveyor would ■constitute a valid appropriation of the land as against such claims. Horton v. Pace, 9 Texas, 84; Jenkins v. Chambers, 9 Texas, 231; Jones v. Burgett, 46 Texas, 293; Styles v. Gray, 10 Texas, 506; and in Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, 392, strong language is used recognizing the adoption of field notes previously surveyed as being a legal survey within the spirit of our law as it stood previous to the adoption of our Revised Statutes. At the same time, it is not to be denied that to constitute a survey strictly within the terms of our law as it has always been, it would be necessary for the work to be done upon the ground in the manner prescribed by the statute.
In Stafford v. King, 30 Texas, 269, it is said: “It is the duty of the surveyor to run round the land located and intended to be embraced by the survey and patent, to see that such objects are designated on it as will clearly point out and identify the locality and boundaries of the tract, and to ""extend a correct description of these objects, natural and artificial, with courses and distances, into the field notes of the survey, in order that they may be inserted in the patent, which will afford the owner, as well as other persons, the means of identifying the land that was in fact located and surveyed for the owner.” In Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 284, it is said: “Actual surveys by which lands granted by the State shall be specifically described and distinguished have always been contemplated and prescribed by our laws. It is true, that under the laws in force when the surveys in controversy were made for the railway company, it was not always regarded as indispensable, however desirable, that the lines of the survey should be actually run and measured on the ground.”
Recognizing the great inaccuracies that had frequently resulted from the practices of the different surveyors in attempting to make out field notes in their offices without surveying the land upon the ground, our Legislature, in adopting the Revised Statutes, inserted this provision, (article 3908): “The field notes of each survey shall state: (1) The county or district in which the land is situated. (2) The certificate or other authority under or by virtue of which it is made, giving a true description of same by numbers, date, when and where issued, name of original grantee, and quantity. (3) The land by proper field notes with the necessary calls and connections for identification (observing the Spanish measurement by varas). (4) A diagram of the survey. (5) The variation at which the running was made. (6) It shall show the names of the chain carriers. (7) It shall be dated and signed by the surveyor. (8) The correctness of the survey, and that it was made according to law, shall be certified to officially by the survey or whomade the same; and also, that such survey was actually made in the field, and that the field notes have been duly recorded, giving book and page. (9) When the survey has been made by a deputy, the county or district surveyor shall certify officially that he has examined the field notes, has found them correct, and that they are duly recorded, giving book and page of record.”
We think the principal object of the Legislature in requiring such strictness in the certificate to be made by the surveyor was to correct the abuse to which the previous law had been subjected as above indicated; and we think it must be conceded, that if the Legislature has the power to condemn what is commonly known as an office survey or office work, and to require its officers, before parting with the public land of the State, to have the surveying actually done in the field, it has done so by the passage of this statute. We know of no case in which the question has been raised as to the validity of an office survey, or the adoption of previous field notes for a survey which should have been made in the field, since the adoption of our Revised Statutes: but our Supreme Court, in several cases, has given strong intimations that its rulings under previous laws would not apply to such surveys.
In Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, cited above, in which the very strongest language is used in upholding such surveys under previous laws, it is said: “ The manner of making surveys was not so specifically prescribed, nor the requirements so exacting, in the year 1874 as are they by the law now in force,” etc. Also, Chief Justice Stay ton, in a dissenting opinion delivered by him in Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 290, uses this language: “I do not understand the holding to be that the field notes returned into the General Land Office were void because not based -on the actual survey of each of the four lines of every section embraced in the block. If such were the holding, it would be useless to refer to -decisions made under the laws in force prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes for the purpose of showing that the rulings of this court have in all preceding cases been to the contrary.” Also, see the opinion of the majority of the court in Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 284, quoted above.
In Jumbo Cattle Company v. Bacon and Graves, 79 Texas, 12, in speaking of what would constitute a survey of this land under the Acts of 1879 and 1881, it is said: “ We think, too, that the agreed statement shows that they have taken all the steps required of them to perfect their right to the land had these acts remained in force. However improbable it may be that this vast quantity of land could have been surveyed into sections of 640 acres each within two days, we feel bound to follow the explicit agreement, that on January 19 and 20, 1883, the said surveyor of Palo Pinto Land District surveyed the lands in controversy into tracts of .640 acres each.”
It will be borne in mind that the question presented for decision in this case is not whether the field notes, made out as indicated in the first part of this opinion, constitute such a survey as the officers of the State could adopt, should they see proper to do so, nor whether it is such an absolute nullity as could be taken advantage by a third party; but the question is, does it constitute such a survey within the meaning of the law as the State can be compelled to accept in opposition to its wishes ? The appellants are seeking to enforce against the State an executory con-tract, and base their right to do this upon the ground that they have complied with their part of such contract. In such case, we think they should show that they have obtained the field notes in the manner the State said they should be obtained in its prqposition, and not that they have got as good field notes in some other way as would have been obtained had they complied with the State’s offer. Had an individual owned this large body of land, and had published and offered to sell to any person 640 acres, who would have it surveyed by the authorized public surveyor of the county in which the land was situated, arid that such surveyor must certify that the work was actually done in the field, we think it would hardly be contended that the proposed purchaser could file his petition against the owner, setting up that the surveyor had copied some field notes for him from the work which had been done by some other surveyor years before, and that by reason of the field notes thus obtained he had a right to compel the owner to accept such field notes as a compliance with his offer, and to execute a deed for the land embraced therein; and we see no reason why a different rule should be applied to the State than that applied to an individual under similar circumstances. We know of no case in which the State, as a compliance with an executory contract, was held bound against its wish to accept one of these office surveys, even under the old law; and still less do we believe that it could be compelled to accept such field notes under the law as it was at the time these surveys purport to have been made.
We think the court did not err in overruling appellants’ special exceptions to the petition of the State. Appellants had filed an application to purchase land under the Act of 1879, giving the description of their desired purchase substantially as set forth in the petition in this case, thereby showing that they assert claim to that part of the State’s land, and we think they can not be heard to say that such description was not sufficient in a petition brought to cancel their claim; besides, the answer filed by appellants contained a sufficient description of that part of the land embraced in the State’s petition which they claimed, and we see no reason why such description would not serve as a basis for the judgment rendered.
We also see no objection to the form of the State’s petition. State v. Delesdenier, 7 Texas, 76; The State v. Kroner, 2 Texas, 492; Day Land and Cattle Co. v. The State, 68 Texas, 535.
We do not now consider it ah open question in this State, that the State, in a suit of this kind, is not required to make a tender of the money received by it. The State v. Snyder, 66 Texas, 687; The State v. Thompson, 64 Texas, 690; The State v. Rhomberg, 69 Texas, 220; Randolph v. The State, 73 Texas, 485.
It will be seen from the conclusions of fact adopted by us, that we are of opinion that the finding of the court below, that Graves was an employe in the Land Office at the time he entered into the contract with Bacon to acquire this land, is supported by the evidence. We think the circumstances disclosed by the record lead to this conclusion, and would have justified a finding that, before he tendered his resignation, Graves and Bacon had come to an understanding as to the terms of their contract, and that Graves’ resignation was tendered in pursuance of this understanding, to enable him successfully to carry out the arrangement that had previously been understood would be made when it might be legally done; but as what we have said disposes of all the land in controversy, and as we have not fully decided as to the effect the agreement above indicated would have in a case where all steps prescribed by the law in the acquisition of the land from the State were taken, after the resignation had become complete, we have thought it best to express no opinion, thereon.
We are of opinion that the first conclusion of law by the court below, that Bacon and Graves were not responsible parties at the time they applied to purchase this land, and could not purchase under the law, can not be sustained. We incline to the opinion that the question of responsibility, within the meaning of the Act of 1879, was for the surveyor to decide; and if he held them responsible parties and made the survey, this, would be sufficient to hold the land until the expiration of the time allowed the purchaser in which to make payment. We do not believe it was the policy of the law to restrict such sales to persons who, upon investigation of their financial condition, would be found able to pay for the land proposed to be purchased out of their own means, and thereby preclude those equally worthy, who, while not actually owning sufficient property of their own to make the payment, might yet be able, in the time-allowed, to make the necessary financial arrangements. White v. Martin, 66 Texas, 340.
If the court, in its third conclusion of law,' intended to hold that because some of the surveys had a greater frontage of permanent water than is permitted under law, this would invalidate all of the surveys, we do not think the conclusion correct. It will be noted, that under this law the land was only to be sold in tracts of 640 acres, and we think that, under these provisions each tract must be treated as a separate purchase; and while the sections having such excessive water frontage might be held invalid, in so far as it would enable the proposed purchaser to demand title from the State as to them, yet these invalid sections could still be used as a basis to locate and identify the other surveys in the block.
We are also of the opinion, that the fourth conclusion of law by the court below, to the effect that Bacon and Graves did not make a sufficient tender, can not be sustained as to all of the land. As.stated above, we think each section must be taken as a separate purchase, and the tender made by them sufficiently identified all sections upon which they proposed to pay; and the fact that they did not make tender upon all of the sections embraced in the field notes returned by them would only have the effect to invalidate such part of the proposed purchase as was not. designated in their offer to pay.
By the decision in Jumbo Cattle Company v. Bacon and Graves, 79 Texas, we understand it to be settled that the tender was in time, and that the Treasurer could not defeat their right to purchase by refusing to receive the money .
We are of opinion, that the court below erred in admitting the certificate of the Commissioner of the General Land Office to prove that surveys 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 of block M were never returned to the General Land Office (Buford v. Bostick, 58 Texas, 67); but we are not prepared to say that the evidence outside of this certificate was not sufficient to sustain the finding of the court below that these surveys were never in fact so returned. There was no objection to the certificate of the Commissioner to prove that he had made search for the field notes of these surveys, and had been unable to find them in the General Land Office, and that they were not at the time of making said certificate in their proper places; and we think it quite as probable that these field notes-had been lost or mislaid before they reached the Land Office as after, and for this reason the judgment of the court below as to these surveys could be sustained without reference to the objectionable part of this certificate; but as the bill of exceptions shows that the court below must have considered this part of the certificate of the Commissioner as important evidence to sustain its finding upon this point, we are of opinion, that were, it material in the disposition of the case, it would necessitate a reversal as to these surveys.
We think what we have said sufficiently disposes of the other- assignments of error made by appellants; and as we find no error in the judgment rendered by the court below, we are of opinion that it should in all things be affirmed.'

216299,"Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company v. Bridget Daniels",1892-12-14,"KEY, Associate Justice.
1. Error was committed by the trial court in stating to the jury the issues involved, in omitting to state some oí the defenses interposed by appellant. But this was an omission, and if appellant was not satisfied with it, a special charge should have been asked supplying the defect.
2. After submitting appellee’s theory of the case, as alleged in her petition, the court instructed the jury as follows:
“If, however, you believe the defendant corporation did, and had done, all that could be required to render said bridge secure and safe for the passage of trains, and that the destruction of said bridge and the death of said Horace Daniels was the result of an unprecedented rainfall, and of such a character that no human foresight or skill could provide against, you will find for the defendant.”
This charge is complained of, among other reasons, because it required of appellant a higher degree of care for the safety of its employes than is imposed by law.
This objection is well taken, and must result in a reversal of the case. A master, whether a common carrier or not, is only required to exercise ordinary and reasonable care for the protection of his servants. Our Supreme Court, in considering the liabilities of railway companies to their employes, has frequently applied this doctrine, and held that in furnishing appliances for their use, or in constructing and keeping in repair road beds and bridges, the true test of liability is, whether or not reasonable and ordinary care was exercised; in other words, whether or not the railroad company was guilty of negligence. Railway v. Oram, 49 Texas, 341; Railway v. Lyde, 57 Texas, 505; Railway v. McCarthy, 64 Texas, 632; Railway v. Bell, 75 Texas, 50.
Ordinary care is such care as an ordinarily prudent man would exercise under the circumstances; and a failure to exercise such care is negligence.
This charge required the jury, before they could return a verdict for appellant, to find, first, that it did all that could be required to render the bridge secure and safe for the passage of trains; and second, that the destruction of the bridge and the death of appellee’s husband was the result of an unprecedented rainfall, and of such a character that no human foresight or skill could provide against.
, The first part of this charge, though not accurate, as it omits the word “reasonably” before the word “required,” certainly stated and submitted all that the law required of appellant, and it was error to state, as an additional prerequisite to a verdict for appellant, that the jury must also find that there was an unprecedented rainfall, and especially to require them to find that the rainfall was of such a character as no human foresight or sTcill could provide against.
Even if the question of an unprecedented rainfall had been submitted disjunctively, the language in which it was submitted did not state the law correctly in cases of this kind. It must be borne in mind that the injured party was appellant’s employe; that when he entered the service in which he was engaged at the time of his death, he assumed all of the risks and hazards ordinarily incident to such service; that appellant is not liable to appellee for damages resulting from his death, unless the same was caused by appellant’s negligence, as set out in appellee’s petition, and that the burden rested upon appellee to prove, and not upon appellant to disprove, such negligence. In cases of loss or injury to freight while in the custody of a common carrier, the rule is different. In such cases the carrier is an insurer, and when sued for loss of or damage to freight received by it for transportation, all the plaintiff has to show is the delivery of his freight to the carrier, its loss or damage, and its value or the extent of the injury; and then the burden is cast upon the carrier to show such facts as will relieve it from liability. And it is generally in this class of cases that the rules of law which determine liability for loss or injury resulting from natural phenomena, called in the law books 1: the acts of God,” are discussed. This arises out of the fact that in such cases proof of the utmost care and diligence will not excuse the carrier, and the acts of God and a few other special defenses are the only grounds upon which nonliability can be established. Laws, on Cont. of Carr., 5.
In the present case, it is true that appellant averred in its answer that the accident which caused the death of appellee’s husband was occasioned by an act of God, consisting of an unprecedented rainfall, which no human agency could have foreseen or prevented.
But this was not all of its answer. It pleaded a general denial, and especially denied all charges of negligence. The general denial was all that it was necessary for it to plead to avail itself of the rules of law governing the liability of a railway company to its employes, as announced in the cases above cited; and the fact that it went further, and averred that the injury complained of was caused by the act of God, did not change the rules of law applicable to the case. The correct test of appellant’s liability was whether or not it had been guilty of negligence as charged. And having filed a general denial, the burden was on appellee to prove negligence; and any evidence tending to disprove it, whether it showed that the accident resulted from an act of God or not, was admissible under the general denial.
Appellant asked, and the court gave, a special charge in reference to the alleged freshet, which was correct; but it did not cure the vice in the main charge, because they were in conflict, and the jury could not know which was the better law. Railway v. Robinson, 73 Texas, 277.
The other complaints as to charges given are not well founded.
3. Appellant has several assignments of error based upon the refusal of the court below to give instructions asked, which in effect attempt to maintain the doctrine that if appellant selected ordinarily careful and competent employes to construct and maintain the bridge upon which the accident occurred, or exercised ordinary care in selecting said employes, and did not itself know, and by the exercise of ordinary diligence could not have known, of the insecure condition of the bridge, then it would not be liable.
The statute allowing suits for injuries resulting in death has been amended since this suit was brought, but at the time in question it gave a cause of action when the death of any person was caused by the negligence or carelessness of any proprietor, owner, charterer, or hirer of any railway, steamboat, or stage coach, or other vehicle for the conveyance of goods or passengers, or by the unfitness or gross negligence or carelessness of their servants or agents.
The apjiellee’s cause of action, as disclosed by her petition, is founded upon the alleged negligence of appellant in the construction and maintenance of the bridge, and not upon the negligence, ordinary or gross, of its servants or agents.
The law imposed the duty upon appellant to construct and properly maintain all necessary bridges on its railway; and if it failed to do so, it can not escape liability because its employes to whom it had delegated the performance of these duties, personal to itself, were guilty of negligence, nor because it had exercised due care in selecting such employes.
Such negligence, as against the injured employe, was held in Railway v. Dunham, 49 Texas, 181, to be the negligence of the railway company, and not of the fellow servant; and we think the same doctrine applies to this case.
The case of Hendrick v. Walton, 69 Texas, 192, referred to in appellant’s brief, is not analogous. There was no averment in that ease that the defendant had failed to discharge any duty he owed to the plaintiff, but the charge was that his deputy (the agent) had committed a wrongful act which resulted in death.
The assignments of error that raise this question are not maintainable.
4. It appears that appellee served notice on appellant to take the deposition of Charles Miner ly; that appellant filed cross-interrogatories to the witness; that a commission was issued and returned with a deposition signed and sworn to by Charles Mmley. Appellant objected to this deposition being read as evidence, upon the ground that no notice to take said deposition had been served upon it, and no commission had issued to take said witness’ deposition. This objection was correctly overruled. In our judgment, the two names are idem sonans. Besides, appellant crossed the interrogatories, and it is not made to appear that any injustice resulted to it. We do not think that the same strictness, in excluding testimony because of a variance, should apply in matters of this kind as is properly applied in many other instances.
Delivered December 14, 1892.
5. A. F. Dignowity, John Gilerease, and Charles Emley, nonexpert witnesses, were permitted, over appellant’s objections, to state their opinions as to what caused the bridge to break down, producing the wreck which resulted in the death of Horace Daniels.
All of these witnesses stated the facts upon which their opinions were based, which brought their testimony, except a part of Charles Emley’s, hereafter referred to, within the exception to the general rules which exclude the opinions of nonexpert witnesses. Railway v. Jarrard, 65 Texas, 560; Railway v. Locker, 78 Texas, 279; Whart. Ev., secs. 511, 513.
The witness Charles Emley was permitted to state, as his opinion, that had the timbers of the bridge been larger and sound, the bridge would have been sufficient for the uses of the railway company, except in extraordinary rainfalls.
The rule allowing nonexpert witnesses to give opinions based upon facts within their own knowledge, and stated to the jury or court trying the case, ought not to be extended so as to allow the witness to indulge in argument, or state how, in his opinion, the particular thing ought to have been, unless required to do so in an answer to questions on cross-examination. We think this part of Emley’s testimony should have been excluded.
6. The question based upon the ruling of the court in permitting appellee to enter a remittitur after appellant’s motion for a new trial had been overruled will not be considered, as it is not likely to arise again. Nor shall we pass on the assignment of error asserting that the verdict is not supported by the evidence.
The judgment is reversed and cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded."
216188,John King v. Nathan Mitchell,1892-12-14,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
The appellee, Nathan Mitchell, on the 25th day of August, 1887, sued John King, the appellant, in -trespass to try title for a strip of land on the north end of survey No. 25 — that is, a strip 78.42 varas wide. Survey 25, in the name of Anselmo Gallan, is described as south of survey 24, in the name of Thomas Thatcher, the former calling for the south line of the latter.
Defendant answered not guilty; that the land sued for was vacant land and had been pre-empted by him; and if it was held not to be vacant when pre-empted, that it was a part of survey 24, adjoining 25; and since the suit was brought, to-wit, on June —, 1888, he had purchased the same from Ed. Braden, who owned the southern portion of 24, which title he pleads. *
Plaintiff replied, denying the answer, and alleging that the land in suit was not a part of 24, but was a part of 25; also, that some twelve years before, Ed. Braden, being in possession of that part of the land of survey 24 next adjoining the land in suit on the north, erected a division fence on what was then considered by him and plaintiff the division line between the two surveys, plaintiff then owning survey 25; that the fence has remained where it was placed, and is now standing; that it was tacitly, if not expressly, agreed by plaintiff and Braden at that time and ever afterward to be the division line between the two surveys; that in 1884, plaintiff being the owner of survey 25, desiring to enclose the land, obtained Braden’s consent and agreement that plaintiff should join on to the division fence, which both had considered and agreed was the division line, whereby both parties acted on the former understanding and tacit agreement that the fence was on the line; and plaintiff did join to the same, enclosing the strip in question, since which time he has been in the quiet possession of the same until ejected by defendant, as alleged in original petition.
A jury was waived, and the cause submitted to the court, who rendered judgment for plaintiff, stating therein the grounds of the judgment as being of opinion that there was no vacancy between surveys 24 and 25, and that therefore there were no pre-emption rights; and “ the court being of the opinion that the south boundary, line of survey No. 24 and the north boundary line of survey No. 25 being one and the same, and that said line had long since and for many years been established and acquiesced in by the owners, and is now, as it has been for many years, marked by a line of fence extending along said line, erected by one Ed. Braden, the same is hereby established as the true and correct boundary line,” etc.
Defendant appealed, and assigns errors by the court:
1. In holding that there was no vacancy.
2. In holding that the excess belonged to survey 25.
3. The evidence shows that survey 24 is the older survey, and is entitled to the land in controversy, if it is an excess.
4. The holding that the land is an excess and belongs to survey 25 changes all the original calls; while holding that it belongs to survey 24, or defendant, harmonizes with the calls.
The material facts, as we find them, are:
There are about 1118 acres of land in survey 24, and 464 acres in"" survey 25. The alleged vacancy is not quite 38 acres; the strip between the surveys is 78.42 varas wide.
Survey 24 was made in February, 1838, and survey 25 in June, 1838. Survey 24 calls its south line as running from a mound, west 1547 varas to a stake, from which two mesquites are named as bearings. The north line of survey 25 calls for the south line of No. 24, and to run with its full length 1547 varas between two other surveys, and at the northwest corner of 25 the same witness trees are called for that are named to identify the southwest corner of 24. There is evidence tending to show that the line of 24 is where plaintiff claims it to be — enough to support such a conclusion if the court had so found; but there is testimony tending to show that it can not be identified on the ground, and that distance will leave a vacancy between the two surveys.
It is shown that defendant has complied with the preliminary requirements of the law as a pre-emptor of the land in suit, by making application, supported by affidavit, and having the land surveyed as such by the proper surveyor, and by residence upon the land; the application being made February 9, 1885, the survey February 3, 1886.
It was admitted that plaintiff owned survey 25, which was patented in June, 1881. Survey 24 was patented in February, 1849.
It was proved that Braden built his fence on what he believed was his south line (the south line of survey 24) in 1878; that he at no time claimed any land south of his fence, and has since claimed the fence as the line.
It was also proved that plaintiff, owning survey 25, though he thought the fence too far south, recognized it as the division line between the two surveys, and that he acted upon it by enclosing all of survey 25, and joining to the fence by Braden’s consent. He says, and the court below having so found if necessary to his conclusion upon this subject, we find, that Braden was present when he joined fences and agreed that he should do so.
Delivered December 14, 1892.
In out opinion, the conclusion of the court below, that there was no vacancy between surveys 24 and 25, is correct; and this being so, no right of pre-emption could be acquired in the supposed vacancy.
It was evidently the intention of the locating surveyor to include all the land; and though there may be some excess, it is not so great as to defeat that intention. Survey 25 being the junior survey and calling for the south line of 24, will extend to that line wherever it is established, there being no unreasonable discrepancy in the distance, even though the south line of 24 may'be an open line. We do not intend to say that it is an open line, for there is some evidence to fix it on the ground as identical with the Braden fence, and quite enough to sustain that conclusion, if it had been so found by the court below. Moore v. Reiley, 68 Texas, 668; Moore v. Stewart, 7 S. W. Rep., 774; Freeman v. Mahoney, 57 Texas, 626; Anderson v. Stamps, 19 Texas, 460.
There was no error in the court’s finding that there was no vacancy between the two surveys.
The judgment of the court below is not based upon the fact that the excess belongs to survey 25, but upon two facts: that there is no vacancy, and that the line has been established by acquiescence of the owners.
There is no error assigned to the latter conclusion; and there being no fundamental error, it will not be disturbed. Floyd v. Rice, 28 Texas, 341, and authorities cited; Browning v. Atkinson, 46 Texas, 606.
Finding no error in the judgment of the court below, it is affirmed.
Affirmed."
216209,The Bank of California v. John F. Marshall,1892-12-14,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
The appellant has a single assignment of error, which is as follows:
“The court erred in holding that the property in issue, and claimed by the defendant in this case, was not subject to plaintiffs’ writ of attachment, and in rendering judgment for the defendant; because it appears, from the agreed case, that the plaintiffs were creditors of Eaton, Guinan & Co., who made the deed of trust to Marshall, under which he claims, before the execution and delivery of the deed of trust by them to him; that the property was seized under an attachment regularly sued out and issued upon plaintiffs’ debt, being a stock of merchandise theretofore held by said Eaton, Guinan & Co., and being disposed of by them as wholesale and jobbing merchants; that the firm of Eaton, Guinan & Co., and each and all the members thereof, were, at the time of making said deed of trust, wholly insolvent, and had no other property than that levied upon; that said debt and judgment rendered thereon is still in full force and effect; that the deed of trust exhibited with the agreement, together with the property, was delivered to the trustee, and the deed was immediately registered as a chattel mortgage; and it appearing from the deed of trust that the trustee was authorized to sell the merchandise so conveyed in the usual course of trade to pay off the debts scheduled therein, provided that if at the expiration of three months a sufficiency of the property was not sold to pay the debts, that the trustee, after having been requested by a majority in interest of the secured creditors, might advertise said property and effects for sale at auction; it appearing also that the most of said debts were already due, and it not appearing that any of the creditors named have accepted said deed.”
Under this assignment, appellant makes the proposition, “ that as Eaton, Guinan & Co., having made a deed of trust, to secure certain preferred creditors named therein, to the claimant, John F. Marshall, on a stock of goods, wares, and merchandise, and said firm and its members being at the time of the execution and delivery of said deed wholly insolvent, and having no other property out of which plaintiffs could make their debts, and said deed of trust providing that said Marshall should sell said goods in the usual course of trade for three months, and until requested in writing by a majority in interest of the creditors secured by the deed of trust, and it not appearing that said creditors or any of them ever accepted said deed of trust, the same was void, because, in connection with the uncontroverted facts, the effect of the same was to hinder, delay, and defraud their creditors.”
It is apparent that John F. Marshall, the trustee, accepted the terms of the trust, and in the absence of a repudiation of its terms by the beneficiaries, his acceptance will enure to their benefit. Bew. on Assign., 5 ed., 400, 401, 402; 1 Jones on Mort., 4 ed., sec. 88; Wallis v. Beauchamp, 15 Texas, 305.
The main question in the case presented by appellant is, that as the deed of trust requires the trustee to sell the merchandise in the usual course of trade, its effect is to hinder, delay, and defraud other creditors, and for this reason the instrument, upon its face, should be held void, taken in connection with the fact that Eaton, Guinan & Co. were insolvent at the time of its execution.
It is a well established principle of law that a debtor in failing circumstances may secure and prefer á bona fide debt of his creditors, although the effect of such preference would be to hinder and delay other creditors. The limitation imposed by law upon this right prevents the debtor from transferring to the creditor more property than is reasonably sufficient to satisfy the debt, and denies the creditor the right to give the debtor a moneyed consideration for the property in addition to his debt. In such cases, and in others that may be mentioned, the effect of such transactions would be to give the creditor the right to control and dispose of property not necessary to the payment of his debt, and to place the debtor in a position to hinder, delay, and defraud his creditors.
The court can not determine from the face of the instrument that it will have the effect of defrauding other creditors. That can only be ascertained from the facts of the case.
If it be true that the debtor has transferred to the trustee all of his property for the benefit of the preferred creditors, and the property is less in value than the debts secured, and the instrument permits a sale in due course of trade or otherwise, we fail to see how such fact is calculated to hinder and delay and defraud other creditors. It is true that the effect of such a transaction would be to hinder and delay, and possibly defeat, the claims of the unsecured creditors; but this is successfully answered by the law permitting an insolvent debtor to prefer a creditor when no advantage or benefit results to the debtor by such transaction, or the creditor gets no more than his debt.
In appellant’s assignment of error it is admitted that “Eaton, Guinan 6 Co., and each and all the members thereof, were at the time of making said deed of trust wholly insolvent, and had no other property than that levied upon.”
It is seen from the facts that the value of the property as levied upon by the writs of attachment in the several cases mentioned in the findings of fact is much less than the amount of the debts secured by the terms of the deed of trust. Under the facts, we do not see how the fact that the trustee can sell in the usual course of trade operates as a fraud upon the appellant, as it is apparent that a disposition of all of the goods is not sufficient to satisfy the claims of the preferred creditors.

We find no error in the record, and affirm the judgment of the court below.
Affirmed.
Motion for rehearing refused."
216292,Guadalupe County v. William Johnston,1892-12-21,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
This action was brought by the appellee, William Johnston, against Guadalupe County, the appellant, for specific performance of a contract, by which it is claimed that the county was to purchase plaintiff’s farm of 271 acres of land for a poor farm, and to pay him $6000 therefor, and' also for damages for breach of the contract. Before the trial closed plaintiff abandoned his claim for damages, and relied only upon his right to specific performance.
Defendant filed a general demurrer and special exceptions to the petition, which were overruled. It also filed a general denial and special answers.
The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiff for specific performance, and for $6000, from which defendant has appealed, and assigns errors, two of which are as follows:
“ The court erred in overruling defendant’s general demurrer to the petition herein, in that the petition does not state facts sufficient to entitle plaintiff to decree for specific performance.”
“The court erred in overruling defendant’s third special exception to the petition, to the effect that tlie petition alleges that the Commissioners Court, on the 13tli day of October, 1888, made and entered of record the order of which the paper thereto attached and marked exhibit 1B ’ is a copy, and does not allege the tenor, contents, or effect of said order, and thus attempts to make an exhibit supply material averments to the petition, in contravention of the rules of pleadings prescribed for the court.”
The petition relating to specific performance is as follows:
“ That heretofore, to-wit, at the-term of the County Commissioners Court of Guadalupe County, he entered into an agreement with the County of Guadalupe, said county acting through and by the said Commissioners Court, to sell to said county the tract of land described in the deed hereto attached as a part of this petition, marked ‘A.’ That said county, through said court, had previously advertised for property and prices for the purpose of establishing a poor farm, or place to keep and take care of the paupers of the county, and in' obedience to said advertisement petitioner placed his property at the disposal of said county at the sum of $6000, being the property described in said deed; and thereupon said Commissioners Court, on the 13th day of October, 1888, made and entered of record the order of which the paper hereto attached marked 1 B’ is a copy. That the proposal of petitioner was made in writing. Thereupon, and being induced thereto by said order ‘ B ’ and the offer of acceptance by said county, through said court, petitioner purchased a 40-foot road, in all respects complying with the requirements of said order and acceptance, for which he paid the sum of $300; that on procuring said road, petitioner presented a deed from the owner of the land over which said road runs, and a deed from petitioner for said land, said deed being exhibit ‘A,’ and demanded a fulfillment of said contract and pay for his property, according to contract; whereupon said Commissioners Court, acting on behalf and for said county, refused to accept said deeds and pay for said property, for no other or better reason than that said contract was distasteful to some persons, and subjected said commissioners to some adverse criticism. Petitioner alleges that he has in all things complied with the letter and spirit of said contract. That on the faith thereof, and relying upon the good faith of said Commissioners Court, he purchased said roadway at a cost of $300, for which petitioner has no other use than to comply with his said contract. That said roadway would not have been purchased except to comply with said contract, and said Commissioners Court and Guadalupe County was aware of the fact when said executory contract was made, that if petitioner furnished a road so as to enable him to comply with said contract, that he would have to purchase the same.”
Prayer for enforcement of the contract.
Exhibit “A” is a general warranty deed by plaintiff and his wife to the county for 271 acres of land, acknowledged in due form, deed dated November 15, 1888.
Exhibit “ B” is as follows:
“ Saturday, October 13, 1888.
“ Court met pursuant to adjournment. County judge and all the commissioners present, and proceeded to business.
“ In the matter of purchasing a farm for a poor farm:
“Motion was made by J. N. Bishop, and seconded by R. D. McGee, to accept Wm. H. Johnston’s bid, upon the condition that he furnished a 40-foot open road from his northwest corner to the Seguin and Gonzales road, on suitable ground; which motion being put to a vote, was carried. J. N. Bishop and R. D. McGee voting yea; F. C. Weinert and F. M. Beyer voting nay. There being a tie vote, the county judge decided the motion by voting yea.
“It is further ordered that W. H. Johnston have until November term of the court to accept.’ ’
The general demurrer and special exception should have been sustained. No legal liability on the part of the county is alleged. It is not enough to state that a contract was made, as shown in the exhibit, but the legal obligations created by the contract should have been set forth by appropriate averments. Exhibit “ B” may be evidence of a contract, but its terms can not take the place of allegations of its legal effect. The pleader must make “ a full and clear statement of the cause of action, and such other allegations pertinent to the cause as plaintiff may deem necessary to sustain his suit.” A historical statement of the transactions between the parties is not such a statement. The legal import of the transactions and the undertakings imposed must be stated, as well as the failure to perform them. The allegation of performance on the part of plaintiff, and the failure of performance on the part of defendant, may be sufficiently stated, if it had been shown what was required to be performed.
Delivered December 21, 1892.
We are compelled to hold that both the above assignments of error should be sustained. Dist. Ct. Rule 19; Macdonell v. Railway, 60 Texas, 594; Jones v. Jones, 49 Texas, 690; Holman v. Criswell, 13 Texas, 38; Whitaker v. Record, 25 Texas Supp., 382; Crawford v. Hagood, 40 Texas, 398; Gray v. Osborne, 24 Texas, 158; Ross v. Breeding, 13 Texas, 17; Fortune v.

Welch, 22 Texas, 418; 15 Texas, 179; 5 Texas, 585; 15 Texas, 403.
The necessary allegations omitted are not supplied by defendant’s answer nor by plaintiff’s supplemental petition in reply thereto.
This being the condition of the ease, we are not required to consider other assignments of error claimed to have occurred on the trial.
The judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is so ordered.
Reversed and remanded."
216304,"Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company v. Charles Porfert",1892-12-21,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
This suit was instituted in the District Court of Bexar County, by appellee, against appellant, to recover damages for she alleged negligence' of appellant in running an engine operated by its servants against him while he was attempting to cross the railway at a crossing, thereby severely and permanently injuring him.
Defendant answered by general denial, and that appellee was guilty of contributory negligence.
Verdict and judgment were in favor of appellee for $7250.
The second error assigned is as follows: “ The plaintiff having testified that his statement on this trial was different from his statement on the former trials of this case as to the distance the train was from him when he first saw it, and having in answer to the question, 1 Have you read the opinion of the Supreme Court reversing this case ?’ said, ‘ Yes, I have,’ the court erred in not permitting defendant’s counsel to ask the plaintiff the following question: ‘ Have you not made a different statement in your testimony on this trial as to the distance the train was from you when you first saw it, from the statements you made in your testimony on the former trials of this case, by reason of the Supreme Court having reversed the case and you having seen the grounds upon which the case was reversed ?’ because said question was legitimate for the purpose of showing plaintiff’s motive in making such different statements, and thereby to discredit his testimony.”
The former opinion of the Supreme Court in this case reversed and remanded the case for the reason that it appeared from the facts, as then shown, that the appellee was guilty of contributory negligence in not getting off the railway track before he was hit by the locomotive, it appearing that he saw the approach of the engine, and that at such time it was such a distance from him as would have enabled him to leave the track before it reached him, and his failure so to do constituted negligence upon his part.
The testimony of the appellee in the present case upon this point tended to show, that the locomotive was much nearer to him when he first observed it than testified to in the former trial; and that the locomotive being so near and coming with such speed, he did not have time, by the use of diligence, to leave the track before he was struck.
If it be true that the appellee was induced to make this change in his evidence, and to testify upon the second trial differently from what he had testified to on the former trial, about a matter of such importance, by reason of the decision of the Supreme Court referred to, then we believe it was permissible for appellant to prove the fact. The effect of such evidence would be to show the motive of appellee in changing his evidence to be that he was not guilty of the act denounced by the Supreme Court as fatal to his right- of recovery. And it would be a legitimate inference that the jury might consider with other facts in the case that his purpose in testifying differently was to make a case that would meet the objections of the decision rendered in reversing the former judgment. It would be also admissible as a fact or circumstance tending to discredit the appellee, to be considered by the jury for what it may be worth. We think the evidence was admissible.
Delivered December 21, 1892.
There is no merit in the remaining assignments of error.
The facts of this case are in several essentials different from those developed in the former trial, and we can not say that the evidence shows that appellee was guilty of contributory negligence, and will not disturb the verdict for this reason.
As to the°point that the verdict is excessive, that has been settled adversely to the contention of appellant by the judgment of the Supreme - Court in the first appeal of this case. 72 Texas, 344.
For the error in refusing to permit appellant’s counsel to ask the appellee the question as heretofore stated, upon the trial, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause.
Reversed and remanded."
219267,"T. M. Campbell, Receiver, v. Ed. B. Wiggins, Tax Collector",1892-12-15,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
Action by T. M. Campbell, as receiver of the International & Great Northern Railway, brought in the District Court of Smith County, to enjoin appellee, as collector of taxes of said county, from collecting certain taxes assessed against said railway on money in the hands of appellant as receiver for the years 1890 and 1891, and to enjoin the sale of certain property which had been levied on by said collector therefor. A temporary injunction was granted by the judge in chambers. On trial of the cause, March 17, 1892, the court sustained general and special demurrers to the petition and trial amendment; and plaintiff having declined to further amend, the cause was dismissed at his cost, and as receiver he was ordered to pay the taxes sought to be enjoined.
The seizure of the property was made on February 4, 1892, and plaintiff at once applied to the court, by a petition filed in the cause No. 3123, Jay Gould v. The International & Great Northern Railway Company, and obtained a temporary restraining order for five days until he could prepare an original petition for injunction. This order was granted by the judge, and this suit for injunction was then instituted.
Plaintiff’s first amended original petition, filed March 15, 1892, and his trial amendment filed March 16, 1892, show his cause of action substantially as follows:
That plaintiff was the duly appointed and acting receiver of the International & Great Northern Railway in a suit of Jay Gould v. The International & Great Northern Railway Company, No. 3123, and as such receiver was, and had been for more than six months past, in possession of and operating the International & Great Northern Railway, together with all its property; that defendant, Ed. B. Wiggins, was the tax collector of Smith County; that on February 4, 1892, said tax collector, under the provisions of article 4746, Revised Statutes of Texas, levied on, seized, and took into his possession, and from the possession of plaintiff as receiver, certain cars, fully described by number and character, and certain real estate, also fully described; all of said property being the property of the International & Great Northern Railway Company, in the hands of plaintiff as receiver.
It was averred, that the ears were situated upon the main line and track of the company in the city of Tyler, and were necessary to the operation of said railroad; that by the levy the main line and switches were blocked, and the traffic upon the main line of said railway through the city of Tyler was impeded and materially interfered with.
Plaintiff averred, that on February 4, 1892, the court had granted a temporary injunction, to continue in force no longer than five days, provided that plaintiff did not file within said time an original suit by injunction for a temporary and permanent injunction to restrain the defendant. The plaintiff feared that said property, or other property in his hands, would again be seized and was threatened with seizure by the defendant; and he charged that said levy and impending seizure would work irreparable injury to him as receiver, and to the property in his hands, by in a measure suspending and blocking the traffic upon said road and rendering him liable to shippers for delays, for failure to furnish cars, and in receiving and forwarding shipments, and by clouding and complicating the title to said real estate by a sale for taxes.
It was alleged, that said seizure was made for the purpose of satisfying certain assessments made by the tax assessor of Smith County for State and county taxes upon the property of the International & Great Northern Railway Company, on account of certain supposed deposits with the bank of Bonner & Bonner, in Tyler, Smith County, Texas, assessed as “ money on hand;” that said assessments were on the sum of $402,598.90 for the year 1890, and on the sum of $274,485.41 for the year 1891; and the taxes for which the seizure was made amounted for the year 1890 to the sum of $3925.33, and for the year 1891 to the sum of $2584.48.
Plaintiff alleged, that all of the money on which the tax was levied was money earned by the International & Great Northern Railway, and not acquired by virtue of the charter of the Great Northern -Railway Company or the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, and was therefore exempt from taxation under the special act of the Legislature of Texas, approved March 10, 1875, the whole of which act he set out in his trial amendment, as well as the act of the Legislature incorporating the International Railway Company, passed August 5, 1870.
Plaintiff further alleged, that he was informed and believed, and so charged, that the receivers of the International & Great Northern Railway had no such amount of funds in the hands of said bank at the dates mentioned, nor indeed any amount above the liabilities of the receivers to other roads and individuals on account of debts and freight balances due on account of exchange of freight with other roads. That all of the funds arising from the operation of the railway were deposited by the receivers with said bank pursuant to the order of the District Court of Smith County, and all freight balances and dues to other lines and individuals were paid therefrom; that in fact a very large percentage of the funds so deposited was not the property of the receivers, but belonged to other lines.
Plaintiff attached to his petition as an exhibit a copy of a protest filed for plaintiff by his cashier .with the Commissioners Court of Smith County, sitting as a board of equalization, on July 23, 1891, which he alleged was a true and correct statement of the condition of said deposit; and that on August 6, 1891, the said board of equalization fixed the assessments at the amounts as before alleged.
Said statement showed the amount of the deposit with Bonner & Bonner to be on January 1, 1890, $604,990.54. It showed liabilities of the receivers of that date, which were claimed as deductions:
(1) Cash collections for other railways, on account of
freight, tickets, and car service in transit........$152,391 64
(2) Rent on Colorado River bridge....... 15,500 00
(3) Lease of Galveston, Houston & Henderson Railway... 25,850 00
(4) Cash on Jay Gould judgment, actually paid, but not
credited in books for want of voucher............ 50,000 00
(5) Pay rolls and pay checks................... 142,982 83
Vouchers for supplies and salaries of officers......... 281,741 79
Total............................................ $668,466 26
604,990 54
Balance .......................................... $63,476 72
It also showed credits due the International & Great Northern Railway from other roads on account of freight, tickets, and car services on January 1, 1890, $403,785.16.
There was also a similar statement made by exhibit for January 1, 1891.
That there was a memorandum made on each assessment as fixed by the board, signed by W. S. Herndon as “general solicitor for the receivers,” as follows: “ This assessment agreed to by the receivers of the International & Great Northern Railway, August 6, 1891.” That at the time of the signing of said memoranda, plaintiff was one of the receivers of said railway jointly with T. R. Bonner, and that the said W. S. Herndon had not the power and authority, without the knowledge and consent of plaintiff, to enter into, in the name of the receivers, any such contract or agreement, and that the same was made without the knowledge or consent of plaintiff, and was not binding on plaintiff or the property which he represented.
He further charged, that although the books of Bonner & Bonner showed that on January 1, 1890, and on January 1, 1891, the receivers had large sums of money on deposit, yet in truth the said bank had in its vaults or in its possession on January 1, 1890, from all sources, in money, only the sum of $59,557.85, and on January 1, 1891, in money, only the sum of $38,722.77; that of the money on hand in said bank on January 1, 1890, $54,569.85 consisted of the United States nontaxable notes, and of the amount on hand January 1, 1891, $31,722.77 consisted of United States nontaxable notes, leaving the amount of taxable moneys on hand in said bank on January 1, 1890, from all sources, $4988, and the amount of taxable moneys on hand from all sources on January 1, 1891, the sum of $7000, which sums were assessed against Bonner & Bonner, as shown by the assessment rolls; and if the said receivers had any balance in their favor on deposit account with Bonner & Bonner on said respective dates, the same was merely a debt or credit with them, not liable to assessment in the county of Smith, but, if at all, in the county of Anderson, where it was alleged the principal office and domicile of the International & Great Northern Railway Company and of the receivers were; and which credits could only be assessed as to such sum as should appear as a balance, after deducting all liabilities as before set out.
Wherefore, it was alleged the said assessment and the attempted collection of taxes was without authority of law and wholly void; and plaintiff prayed for an injunction restraining defendant and his successors in office from further interfering with the property of the International & Great Northern Railway Company in the hands of plaintiff as receiver on account of taxes, and commanding him to desist from further levies, and to release the property levied on and to restore it to the possession of plaintiff.
Defendant excepted to the petition, that it was wholly insufficient to entitle the plaintiff to the relief for which he prayed. He also addressed special exceptions to the sufficiency of the petition, and his general demurrer and special exceptions sufficiently presented the questions raised.
The principal question in the case is presented by the appellant’s first assignment of error, as follows: “The court erred in dissolving the injunction, because, under the special statutes set out in full in plaintiff’s trial amendment, the property or money upon which their tax is levied is exempt from taxation.”
The incorporation of the International Railway Company by the Legislature of the State of Texas, by the Act of August 5, 1870, and the granting to that company of bonds of the State amounting to 810,000 a mile, and an exemption of its property from taxation for five years, as well as the Compromise Act of March 10, 1875, by which lands were substituted in place of the bonds, and an exemption of the property of the company from taxation for twenty-five years was made, is familiar history in the legislation of this State. By the Act of August 5, 1870, which was the charter of said company, the route over which the line of railway was to be constructed was designated; the usual charter powers and provisions were conferred and made; the bonds were granted, and the property of the company was exempted from taxation. Afterward the International Railway Company was consolidated with the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company. When the controversy about the bonds of the State to the International Railway was settled by the Compromise Act of 1875, the consolidation of the two companies had already taken place, and was recognized by said act.
The act was entitled “An act for the relief of the International Railroad Company, now consolidated with the Houston & Great Northern Railroad Company, under the name of the International & Great Northern Railroad Company.” The preamble to said act recited the act of incorporation of the International Railway Company; the grant of the bonds of the State to said company by said act; that about two hundred miles of said railway had been constructed; and that said company had been consolidated with the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, It also referred to the questions that had arisen as to the legal liability of the State to deliver said bonds, and declared the purpose of the act to be that “ these questions should be definitely settled by a just and reasonable compromise.” Section 1 of the act is as follows:
“ Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, that in full settlement of and satisfaction of all claims of the said The International Railroad Company and of the said The International & Great Northern Railroad Company against the State for bonds under the provisions of the ninth section of the aforesaid Act of August 5, A. D. 1870, there is hereby granted to the said last named company, its successors and assigns, twenty sections, of 640 acres each, of the unappropriated public lands of the State, for each mile of railroad which has been and which may hereafter be constructed pursuant to the authority conferred by the said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870. And the said company, its successors and assigns, shall have the right to locate said lands as head-right certificates were formerly located, without being under obligations to locate alternate sections for the State; and the said lands, and the certificates issued therefor, are hereby exempted and released from all state, county, town, city, municipal, and other taxes for the period of twenty-five years from the date of the respective certificates issued therefor. And the said railroad company, and its successors, and its and their capital stock, rights, franchises, railroads, constructed and to be constructed pursuant to the Act of August 5, A. D. 1870, and this act, rolling stock, and all other property which now is or hereafter may be owned or possessed by said company or its successors in virtue of the said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870, is hereby exempted and released from all state, count)-, town, city, municipal, and other taxes for a period of twenty-five years from the 5th day of August, A. D. 1875, except county and municipal taxes in such counties, cities, and towns as have donated their bonds to aid in the construction of said railroad; but this exception shall not remain in force in favor of any county, city, or town which, having thus donated bonds, shall make default in the payment of either the interest or principal thereof: Provided, that this exemption from taxation shall not be construed to include or apply to the lands or railroads which at the time of the consolidation herein before recited belonged to the Houston & Great Northern Railroad Company, or which has since been or hereafter may be constructed or acquired under its charter: Provided, nothing in this act contained shall be so construed as to exempt from taxation any lands to-which the company may be entitled by virtue of the charter of the Great Northern Railroad Company, or the franchise, roadbed, rolling stock, or any property acquired or hereafter to be acquired by virtue of the charter of the Great Northern Railroad Company; and the lands granted by this-act shall not be sold to any other corporation, or to any person in trust for the use or benefit of said company: And provided further, that the State shall not be liable for any deficiency of the unappropriated public domain on which to locate said land certificates, nor shall any of such unlocated certificates ever constitute a claim against the State.”
Section 2 provides for the issue of the land certificates by the Commissioner of the General Land Office for twenty sections “ for each mile of railway which has been heretofore constructed pursuant to the aforesaid Act of August 5, A. D. 1870.” Section 3 provides for the inspection of the railway in sections of ten miles constructed 11 as authorized by the said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870.” Section 7 provides for the acceptance of the provisions of the act by the stockholders of the International & Great Northern Railway Company, and upon such acceptance, that after compliance therewith by the State, the said act “ shall be and constitute a full, final, and conclusive settlement of all the claims and demands of said company against the State for bonds under ninth section of the said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870; and this act shall also be held to constitute an irrepealable contract and agreement between the State and the said company, its successors and assigns.”
The consolidation of the International Railway Company with the Houston & Great Northern was authorized by section 14 of the Act of August 5, A. D. 1870, incorporating the International Railway Company, is recognized in the compromise act, and the benefits of the act are extended to the consolidated International & Great Northern Railway Company as to all rights and property acquired under the charter of the International Railway Company. It must be observed that the compromise act does not in any manner interfere with the charter of the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, and only “such parts of the said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870, entitled ‘An act to incorporate the International Railway Company, and to provide for the aid of the State of Texas in constructing the same,’ and all other laws inconsistent with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed.”
A clear distinction is made and observed between the two railways which were originally chartered by the Legislature, and the ownership of the consolidated company of its railway property is recognized by the Legislature as derived from two sources, namely, that “ which now is or hereafter may be owned or possessed by said company [International & Great Northern Railway Company] or its successors in virtue of the said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870;” and the lands and railways ‘ ‘ which - at the time of the consolidation herein before recited belonged to the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, or which has since been or hereafter may be constructed or acquired under its charter;” also lands, franchise, roadbed, rolling stock, or any property “ acquired or hereafter to be acquired by virtue of the charter of the Great Northern Railway Company.”
The original act of incorporation of the International Railway Company exempts from the payment of all taxes ‘ ‘ the capital stock and property of said company;” while the compromise act, after exempting from taxation the lands granted in lieu of the bonds, makes the following exemption: “And the said railway company and its successors, and its and their capital stock, rights, franchises, railways, constructed and to be constructed pursuant to the said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870, and this act, rolling stock, and all other property which now is or hereafter may be owned or possessed by said company or its successors in virtue of said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870, is hereby exempted and released from all state, county, town, city, municipal, and other taxes for a period of twenty-five years, from the 5th day of August, A. D. 1875.”
The exemption of “ said railway company and its successors,” and “ its and their capital stock,” etc., does not give any greater scope to the exemption than as to the property enumerated, for if such were the purpose it would be useless to enumerate the property that was to be exempted; and the property enumerated was such as belonged to the International & Great Northern Railway Company, acquired from the International Railway Company by reason of the consolidation of the two companies, which included the railway constructed or to be constructed pursuant to the charter of 1870. and the Compromise Act of 1875, as well as all other property then owned or possessed by the International Railway Company, or that might thereafter be owned or possessed by said company or its successors in virtue of the charter of International Railway Company.
In order to leave no doubt as to what property should be exempted, the law, after expressing as plainly as it could, that it was to be only such property as the new company was entitled to by reason of its acquisition of the charter rights and privileges of the International Company, makes two provisos, in which it is expressly stated, first, that the exemption should not apply to the lands or railways which at the time of the consolidation belonged to the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, or that might since have been or might afterward be constructed or acquired by its charter; and second, after repeating that the lands to which the Great Northern Railway Company might be entitled should not be exempt, the law stated also that nothing in the act contained should be so construed as to exempt from taxation the franchise, roadbed, rolling stock, or any property acquired or thereafter to be acquired by virtue of the charter of said company. This was as it should be. The act was for the relief of the International Railway Company, and in view of the consolidation such relief should have been, and was, granted only so far as the right thereto existed under the charter of 1870 incorporating the International Railway Company.
While the Legislature and the International & Great Northern Railway Company, as the successor of the International Railway Company, may have made the consideration for the release of the State from its obligation to issue its bonds manifest in some other manner, as by the exemption of all the property of the consolidated company, still the design is apparent to make it applicable as nearly as possible to the rights of the International Railway Company as they existed under its charter, and restrict the grant of lands to such railway as should be built along the route designated in the charter, and the exemption from taxation to the property the acquisition of which might be traced to the exercise of the franchise granted thereby. This was well expressed in the discussion of this act in the case of the International & Great Northern Railway Company v. Anderson County, 59 Texas, 661, by Judge Stay ton, in delivering the opinion of the court, in the following language:
“ The act further evidences that the exemption from taxation of property belonging to the consolidated company was to be restricted narrowly and closely to such property as it held or might hold under the charter originally granted to the International Railway Company, and that the benefits otherwise to the consolidated company should be for and on account of acts which the International Railway Company had already performed under its charter, or such as the consolidated company might perform after the date of the act under that charter or the act now in consideration.”
The assessment in this case was against money deposited by the receivers of the International & Great Northern Railway with Bonner & Bonner, bankers, in the city of Tyler.
Money is property in a legal sense. At the time of the passage of the Compromise Act and now, the laws of this State, in providing for the rendition of property for taxes, mention money as property subject to taxation. 2 Pasch. Dig., art. 7713; Rev. Stats., arts. 4671, 4710.
But the appellee has invoked for the construction of the word “ property,” as used in the act, the rule of noscitur a sociis, and contends that the meaning of the word in this instance must be ascertained by reference to the kind of property that is exempted in terms, and that the word as used in the act can apply only to property of a like character to that which is exempted by name, and that money is not exempted from taxation by a proper construction of the act.
We do not deem it necessary, however, to determine whether we may resort to this construction in this instance or not, for the appellant has not by the allegations in his petition brought the property upon which the tax has been assessed within the exemption. His allegation is, 61 that all the money on which this tax is levied was money earned by the International & Great Northern Railway, and not acquired by virtue of the charter of the Great Northern Railway Company, or the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, and is therefore exempt from taxation under said special act,” which he sets out in full.
This allegation may be very true; the money may have been earned by the operation of the International & Great Northern Railway of all its lines as a system, and not acquired by virtue of the charter of the Great Northern Railway Company, or the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, and still not be exempt.
It is not shown that the money, or a part of it, was not earned by the operation of the line of railway constructed in accordance with the charter of the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, or the Great Northern Railway Company, by the International & Great Northern Railway Company. Such being the case, it is not necessary for us to decide whether or not the term u property,” as used in the act, would include money, and so exempt the deposits assessed for taxation. Nor is it necessary to consider whether or not the exemption from taxation applies only to property peculiar and necessary or convenient to the construction and operation of the railway constructed and to be constructed by virtue of the charter of the International Railway over the route designated in that charter; and upon this point the court expresses no opinion.
Appellant’s second assignment of error is as follows: “ The court erred in dismissing the plaintiff’s petition, but should have held it over for a hearing on the merits, because said petition was sworn to, and showed that plaintiff was not liable for near all the taxes claimed by defendant and stated in the judgment, but for a much less amount only, if said property was not protected by said special exemption law; and defendant’s answer not being sworn to, the court should have heard proof of the amount of taxes actually due, as that was an issue made in the cause by the pleadings.”
If the plaintiff’s petition failed to disclose a good cause of action, there was no error in sustaining the defendant’s exceptions thereto. In such event, the plaintiff having declined to amend, the proper practice would be to render judgment for the defendant, dismissing the plaintiff’s cause, as was done by the court. Such would be a trial on the merits.
As we have already held that the petition did not allege facts sufficient to show that the money was exempt from taxation, the suit was properly dismissed, unless the court erred in some other respect as to the sufficiency of the facts to show a cause of action. The fact that the petition was. sworn to will not be claimed to give aid to the legal sufficiency of the allegations, if it should appear from the facts stated that plaintiff would not be entitled to have the valuation of the property reduced below the assessment as made. A demurrer would reach such defects in allegations,, although there might not be a sworn answer denying the facts.
Appellant contends that the assessment should be reduced, because, first, the deposit was subject to setoff by the liabilities of the receivers; and in the second place, because the amount of the assessment was not in the hands of Bonner & Bonner in actual cash, although the deposit account showed more than that amount to the credit of the receivers. Facts were also stated showing that the Commissioners Court, sitting as a board of equalization, had fixed the amount of the assessment. Although a deposit subject to the sight check of the depositor is usually held to be nothing more than a debt against the bank, still it is regarded by the law of this State providing for the rendition of property for taxation as cash, and as such it is not subject to be offset by the liabilities of the tax payer Rev. Stats., arts. 4672, 4692(6).
This can not be disproved by showing that as a matter of fact the bank did not have so much money in its vaults at the time, because sufficient funds of the bank may be on deposit in other banks to meet its draft for the entire amount, and under well known banking rules, a percentage of the deposits are usually loaned to customers; still, whenever the sight check of the depositor is presented, it must be paid, and in ordinary business affairs such deposits are treated as money; and the statute defines money as including 11 every deposit which any person owning the same or holding in trust, and residing in this State, is entitled to withdraw in money on demand.” Taking the statement as furnished by the plaintiff, it would seem that the board of equalization had allowed greater deductions than he was legally entitled to
As it was not necessary for the defendant to furnish proof of the ■amount of taxes due, the same fully appearing from the facts stated in the plaintiff’s petition, there was no error on that ground, as set out in appellant’s third assignment of error, in rendering judgment requiring him to pay the taxes as the receiver appointed by the court for the property against which the tax had been assessed.
The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.

219254,James K. Schmick et al. v. N. W. Noel,1893-01-03,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This case has been twice before the Supreme Court, and may be found reported in 64 Texas at page 406, and in 72 Texas at page 1.
In the year 1883, J. H. Wood, who was then a retail merchant in the town of Cisco, sold his stock of goods to appellee. At the instance of his creditors, these goods were seized under attachment by the sheriff and taken from the possession of appellee, and hence this litigation.
The proof on the last trial tended, to some extent at least, to show, (1) that Wood was insolvent when he made the sale; (2) that his purpose in making the sale was to convert the goods into money in order to place them beyond the reach of his creditors (including those who afterwards attached); (3) that appellee had notice, either actual or constructive, of these facts when he purchased the goods. The. jury, however, must have found in favor of appellee on one or more of these issues, unless they were misled by the charge of the court complained of in the fifth assignment of error, which charge reads as follows:
“ You are further charged, that if at the time of the sale of the goods in controversy to plaintiff (if you believe there was such a sale), Wood was solvent and had sufficient property within reach of his creditors, independently of the goods in controversy, to meet his liabilities, said sale did not have the effect to hinder, delay, and defraud the creditors of said Wood in the collection of their debts, then such creditors would not be permitted to question the terms or purpose of the sale by Wood to plaintiff; and if you so believe, and also believe that such sale was made to plaintiff, then you will find for plaintiff and against the defendant and his sureties.”
This charge needs only to be quoted to show that it is erroneous. That an existing creditor can not be permitted to question the purpose of a solvent debtor in disposing of any portion of his estate subject to execution, where sufficient remains within reach of the creditors undisposed of to meet their liabilities, and that in such case the court may declare that the sale, though fraudulent in fact, does not have the effect to hinder, delay, and defraud such creditors, are propositions so radically wrong that their necessary tendency is to mislead. For this error in the charge, the judgment must be reversed and the cause again remanded for a new trial.
We are urged by the appellants to pass also on the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, but this we must decline to do. Although there have been three trials, we can not anticipate what facts the fourth may develop; nor can we presume, though we should deem the evidence insufficient (upon which we express no opinion), that under a proper charge the jury would return an improper verdict upon the identical evidence here disclosed. If the case had been submitted to us upon ■ this-issue alone, it would have become our duty to pass upon it; otherwise,, we must follow the precedents, and in view of another trial, withhold the expression of comment or opinion on the evidence.
The other assignments of error are not well taken.
Solely for the error in the charge, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered January 3, 1893."
219217,The Western Union Telegraph Company v. J. M. Haman & Co.,1893-01-03,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This appeal is prosecuted by the appellant from a judgment rendered by the County Court of Parker County in favor of appellees in the sum of 8561.12. The judgment was for damages found by the court to have resulted from a failure to deliver a telegraphic message delivered to the agent of the company at Albany, Texas, to be transmitted to Weatherford, Texas.
We find from the record the following conclusions of fact:
1. On and before June 21, 1889, the appellees constituted a firm composed of J. M. Haman, J. E. Dunbaugh, and R. W. Ellis, engaged at Weatherford, Texas, in the business of buying and selling wool.
2. On Friday, June 21, 1889, J. E. Dunbaugh was at Albany, in Shackelford County, for the purpose of purchasing wool for his firm. Finding a quantity of wool for sale, he telegraphed his house through defendant as follows:
“June 21, 1889.
“J. M. Haman & Co., Weatherford, Texas:
“ Can buy some light bright medium at nineteen. Best can do. If can not buy will come home. Answer quick.
“J. E. Dunbaugh.”
To this telegram he received the following reply:
“ Weatherford, Texas, June 21, 1889.
“J"". E. Dunbaugh, Albany, Texas:
“ If not over 10,000 pounds and twelve months, buy it and come home.
“J. M. Haman & Co.”
3. Thereupon Dunbaugh purchased of one E. A. Rose 14,444 pounds of wool, for 13,444 pounds of which he paid 18-J- cents per pound. The remainder was of inferior quality. After this purchase he delivered to the defendant’s agent at Albany for transmission the following dispatch:
“Albany, Texas, June 21, 1889.
“J"". M. Haman & Go., Weatherford, Texas:
“ Bought seventy-six sacks, fourteen thousand, one thousand off One-third, eighteen and a half. All light wools. Twelve months. Be home Sunday,
“J. E. Dunbaugh.”
4. Dunbaugh delivered this message to the agent about 7 o’clock p. m. June 21, 1889, paying the price of the message, 55 cents. He told the agent that it would be in time if sent next morning. He also informed him that the message was important; that he expected his house had probably sold the wool, meaning that his house had probably contracted the sale of it. To be certain that no mistake should be made, Dunbaugh, having written the message, had the agent to transcribe it and himself signed the copy.
5. The defendant did not transmit the message, nor did it on the trial offer to show any excuse whatever for failing to send it. The members of the firm at Weatherford were not informed of the purchase until the arrival of Dunbaugh on June 25.
6. Thirteen thousand four hundred and forty-four pounds of this wool were, on June 21 and June 22, 1889, worth in the market 21 cents per pound. On June 25, 1889, when the firm at Weatherford were first informed of the purchase of the wool, the price had declined. Immediately on receiving the information that the dispatch had not been received, plaintiffs wrote and wired with great diligence to secure a purchaser for the wool. They could not find a purchaser willing to pay more than 14 cents per pound. The wool at the trial remained unsold.
7. Had the dispatch been received on June 22, the plaintiffs could and would have sold the wool at 21 cents per pound.
The facts embodied in the foregoing conclusions would have justified the court, on the application to them of a proper rule for the measure of damages, in awarding to the plaintiffs a greater sum than that included in the judgment. The circumstances surrounding the delivery of the telegram were sufficient to apprise the company, through its agent, of the importance of the message and of the consequences of a failure to deliver it. The loss sustained by the plaintiffs, exceeding under the facts the amount of the judgment, must be held to have been within the contemplation of the parties at the time of the delivery of the message for transmission. The appellant can not complain that the loss of a sale contemplated by the plaintiffs, resulting as it did from the failure to transmit the message, should be measured by the difference “ between the market value of the wool at the time the message should have been delivered and at a reasonable time after the omission to transmit had been discovered.” 2 Sedg. on Dam., sec. 683.
It follows that the court committed no material error in overruling the special exception to plaintiffs’ petition, which exception was to the effect, that the damages sought to be recovered were too “remote, uncertain, and contingent.” The facts stated in our conclusions were amply covered by the averments of the plaintiffs’ petition.
The court did not err in sustaining the motion to suppress the interrogatories propounded to the plaintiffs and the answers thereto. These answers were taken by the officer without the issuance of a commission authorizing them. Eev. Stats., art. 2239-2241.
Nor did the court err in overruling the application, on the ground of newly discovered evidence, praying for a new trial. The plaintiffs, or one of them, had testified that had the message in question been duly delivered, Haman & Co. would have sold the wool to one Loupheimer. The purported newly discovered evidence consisted in a statement by Loupheimer, which defendant expected to procure, contradicting this testimony of plaintiffs. No affidavit by Loupheimer, however, that he would make a statement of such a character was attached to the application. As & substitute for such affidavit, the defendant attached to the application a telegram from one of its employes, that he had interviewed Loupheimer, and that the latter had communicated to him certain facts stated in the telegram and indicating that the testimony of the plaintiffs was untrue. This was manifestly insufficient.
The judgment is therefore affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered January 3, 1893."
219221,Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. C. Behee,1893-01-03,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
In September, 1883, appellee was in the-employ of appellant as brakeman, and on the 25th of said month voluntarily quit said employment. In December following, appellant, for its-own use, printed a pamphlet entitled, “ Missouri Pacific Railway Company, leased and operated lines. List of employes discharged for cause during the months of April, May, June, July, August, September, and-October, 1883.” In said pamphlet appeared a large- number of names, among which was that of appellee, and opposite his name, and in the-column which gave the cause for which employes named in said list were-discharged, was inserted the word “incompetent.” This list was distributed by appellant to its agents who had charge of the employing and discharging of its employes. Appellant at this time was operating something near 6000 miles of railroad, and had in its employ something over 20,000 employes, and this list was issued to prevent men who were found to be unsuitable from being re-employed on other parts, of its road. After ■ appellee learned that his name was in this list he called on T. J. Ray, appellant's train master at Fort Worth, who had previously employed him, and called his attention to the injustice done him by this publication, and Ray, after investigating the matter, gave him a written statement that he had not been discharged on account of “ incomptency,” but had left the service of his own volition. After this, however, in March, 1884, appellant reissued this pamphlet, bringing it down to said month, and in ■ said list appellee’s name appeared as before.
On account of the publication of his name as aforesaid appellee was several times discharged upon the different lines of railway operated by appellant, and for the damage caused him by this publication he instituted this suit, and recovered judgment for $2000, from which this appeal is prosecuted.
Under previous decisions of our Supreme Court, it is quite plain that this publication, made under the circumstances and for the purposes set forth in the conclusions of fact, must be regarded as privileged, and although false, damages can not be recovered therefor against appellant unless express malice be shown. Behee v. Railway, 71 Texas, 424; Railway v. Richmond, 73 Texas, 568; Bradstreet Co. v. Grill, 72 Texas, 121.
That corporations can be made liable in damages for the publication of a libel is now well settled (see authorities cited above; also Railway v. Quigley, 21 Howard, 202; Fogg v. Railway, 148 Massachusetts, 513; Townshend on Slander and Libel, 470-475); and that they can also entertain the express malice necessary to render them liable for such publication seems also to be settled. Townshend, 475, cited above, with authorities referred to in note, some of which are not accessible to us.
As to what is meant by the express malice necessary to render the publisher of a privileged communication liable therefor, has been the subject of much controversy. Mr. Townshend, on page 68 of his work, in defining the terms express and implied malice, says; “ Probably the phrase ‘ implied malice’ is identical with the phrase 6 malice in law,’ and the phrase 1 express malice ’ with the phrase 6 malice in fact.’ ” And again, on page 300, the same author says; “ Few rules of law are of greater practical importance than that which requires proof of express malice where the words were spoken under circumstances which make the communication privileged. The malice required to deprive communications of this sort of protection arising out of the making of the publication must be such as to induce the court, or any reasonable person, to draw the inference that the occasion has been taken advantage of to give currency to an unfounded charge.”
It is well settled that this express malice, or malice in fact, can be proven by circumstances, and one of the most frequent methods of proving it is to show the falsity of the publication and a repetition thereof after notice. Behee v. Railway, 71 Texas, 424; Hays v. Railway, 46 Texas, 272; 1 Whart. on Law of Ev., 31.
In this case it is made to appear that the lists in question were published by order of A. A: Talmage, the general manager of appellant, and it is quite plain that Talmage personally entertained no ill will toward appellee, he not being acquainted with him or knowing that his name was in the book. Talmage, however, only had the publication made; and it is not made to appear to whom the duty of ascertaining the information in reference to these employes was entrusted, nor how the appellee’s name came to be inserted in these lists. This information must have been accessible to appellant. It must have known which one of its employes furnished this information. In addition to the total lack of foundation for the charge against appellee, the publication was reissued after appellant’strain master had full notice thereof. This may have been done through mistake, but if so it would seem that appellant could have shown this more satisfactorily than is disclosed by this record. As stated above, this is one of the methods of proving malice in fact, and in the absence of a clearer showing on the part of appellant, we are not prepared to say that the verdict of the jury finding that such malice should be imputed to it should be disturbed.
We realize how important some such system as this must be for the protection of persons or corporations employing large numbers of men, as well as to the public. At the same time, where an unfounded publication has been repeated, under the circumstances detailed above, we can not say that the verdict of the jury finding malice in fact is not sustained by the evidence.
It seems that after appellee gave the notice to Ray, and received from him the statement referred to above, he several times sought employment on the different lines of appellant’s railway, and after being engaged in good positions was discharged on account of his name appearing in the lists aforesaid, by reason of which he lost much time and was caused mental suffering and annoyance; and under the circumstances we do not regard a verdict of 82000 as excessive.
Let the judgment of the court below be in all things affirmed.
Affirmed.

A motion for rehearing was overruled."
219150,"The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. W. R. Buford",1893-01-10,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On July 3, 1888, appellee, while en route from Brenham to Waco, was a passenger upon the cars of appellant; and ■desiring to change from the said train to the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway, running from Temple Junction to Waco, when appellant’s train ■■stopped at said junction appellee undertook to leave the car, but before he could get entirely off, the train started, and he continued his attempt to leave while the train was in motion, and in so doing was thrown upon •the ground and sustained the injuries for which he recovered.
The evidence sustains the verdict of the jury, that appellant did not stop its train long enough to reasonably enable its passengers to leave the cars; and also, that the cars were moving so slowly that appellant acted as an ordinarily prudent person would have done in making the attempt to leave as he did, and was therefore not chargeable with contributory negligence. The amount of the verdict is not complained of.
. Appellant complains of the action of the court in overruling its special exception to plaintiff’s petition, on the ground that the same was duplicitous, in that in one count it alleges that appellee was thrown from the car without fault on his part, and in another that he was injured by voluntarily attempting to leave the train. We are of opinion that the action of the court was correct, and that the petition was properly framed to meet the different phases of the case as it might be developed by the evidence.
Appellant also complains at the action of the court in giving the following paragraph of its charge to the jury, viz.:
“If plaintiff was injured, and the proximate cause of the injury was defendant’s negligence, plaintiff would be entitled to recover; but if the proximate cause of the injury was plaintiff’s contributory negligence, defendant would be entitled to a verdict, even though defendant may have been negligent also; and if plaintiff and defendant were equally negligent, plaintiff could not recover.”
The ground of appellant’s objection is, that this charge recognizes the erroneous doctrine of comparative negligence. If this charge stood alone, it might very well be held that it was calculated to lead the jury to understand that even though plaintiff was negligent, yet if his negligence was not equal in degree to that of defendant, he would not be precluded from recovering against it. This, of course, would be error. Railway v. Gorbett, 49 Texas, 573. But we are of opinion that there is no positive error in this charge, and that its only defect consists in its liability to mislead, and that this liability was sufficiently corrected in other parts of the main charge given the jury, as well as in the special charge given at the request of the defendant. This special charge is as follows:
“If you believe defendant guilty of negligence as alleged in plaintiff’s petition, in order for you to find for plaintiff you must believe that negligence to have been the proximate cause of the injury, without any contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff. By proximate cause, is meant the actual, direct cause of the injury. By contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff, is meant such imprudent or negligent conduct on his part, without which the accident would not have occurred.”
The giving of the charge complained of is therefore held not to be sufficient cause to require a reversal.
Appellant also complains of the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain this verdict, and we have had great hesitancy in affirming the judgment of the court below upon this ground: It seems to us that the strong preponderance of the evidence tends to show that appellant did stop its train a reasonable time to enable appellee to alight therefrom, and was therefore not guilty of any negligence in starting it when it did. We also think that the preponderance of the evidence tends to the conclusion that appellee, at his age (72), was guilty of contributory negligence in attempting to leave a moving train; but after a careful examination, we believe it would not be proper for us to disturb the finding of the jury upon these questions, after such finding has been approved by the trial court.
As to the length of time the train s'topped for the passengers to leave, the witness Rison, who was with appellee, testified: “ When the train reached the junction I spoke to plaintiff as soon as the train stopped, saying, this is our getting off place. He got up at once. I don’t think the train stopped ten seconds.” And appellee for himself testified: “As soon as the train stopped Mr. Rison told me that was our getting off place, and I immediately got up and walked right out, without stopping to talk or speak to any one. I don’t know whether the car was in motion or not. If it was, I did not notice it.” A number of other witnesses, however, including passengers, as well as employes of appellant, testify, that the train was stopped the usual time, and appellee did not attempt to leave until about the time it started.
As to the speed the train was going at the time appellee got off, his testimony as above set forth was corroborated by that of appellant’s brakeman Bennedetti, who says: “The train was in motion when he got off. The train was just beginning to move up grade, and was moving very gently and slowly, and had gone but about half the length of a car at the time plaintiff got off.” The testimony of several other witnesses, including appellee’s witness Rison, however, tends very strongly to show a much higher rate of speed.
In this state of the evidence as above shown we do not feel authorized to disturb the verdict of the jury, but we would have been better satisfied with a different result. Railway v. Smith, 59 Texas, 406; Railway v. Leslie, 57 Texas, 83.
We are therefore of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.

219210,Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. B. W. Pennell,1893-01-17,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
Appellee was plaintiff in the court below, and received the injuries for which he recovered damages on the 14th of January, 1890, while he was engaged in loading a car of lumber in the yards of appellant for his employer. While he was thus engaged, appellant negligently allowed other cars to come down on the track on which the car he was loading was standing and run against the same, causing a stick of lumber to fall on his leg. The judgment in the court below was for $600, from which this appeal is prosecuted.
This case was submitted to us at a former day of this term upon a suggestion of delay made by appellee under rule 43 of this court. The case had been properly prepared for submission by appellant, and the brief filed by appellee is not in any respect an attempt to comply with the rules of this court in its preparation.
In this state of the record we would be authorized to look alone to the brief of appellant, and in such cases this is the practice we shall adopt in the future. The rule under which this submission was taken does not contemplate that in such cases the labor of examining the record in passing upon appellant’s assignments of error shall be incurred; and where appellee suggests delay, and fails to file a brief in compliance with the rules, all the statements of appellant in his brief as to the contents of the record will be considered as acquiesced in. With this rule enforced in this case, we are of opinion that it would be necessary to reverse the judgment rendered by the court below.
In its first assignment of error appellant complains of the action of the court in giving the following charge to the jury:
“ If the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff was engaged at the time of the alleged injury in loading a car on the track of defendant company, and if they further believe from the evidence that while so engaged agents or servants of the defendant company propelled another car against the one the plaintiff was so engaged in loading, and in so doing were guilty of negligence, etc., they should find for plaintiff.”
This charge, unless the evidence was of that undisputed character which authorized the court to assume that plaintiff was rightfully on appellant’s track, would be objectionable in assuming such to be the case. It does assume that appellee had the right to be where he was at the time of the injury, and unless the evidence was of the undisputed character indicated above, this would be a question for the jury and not for the court. In order to ascertain whether or not this was in fact the state of the evidence, we have been compelled to go outside of appellant’s brief and examine the record, and upon such examination we have arrived at the conclusion that the court did not err in so assuming in its charge. There seems to have been no conflict in the evidence in showing that appellee at the time he was injured was engaged in loading a car that had been placed by appellant on its side track for this purpose, and while so engaged it is settled in this State that appellant owed him the duty to exercise ordinary care to avoid injuring him. Eason v. Railway, 65 Texas, 577; Bonner and Eddy v. Bryant, 79 Texas, 540. We are, however, of opinion that the court’s action in taking this question from the jury was of such doubtful propriety that appellant should not be visited with the penalty of 10 per cent damages for taking this appeal from the judgment .so rendered.
The only other assignment presented in the brief of appellant calls in question the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict, and in passing upon this assignment we have also been compelled to look through the record. Upon an examination of the record, however, we are of the opinion that the evidence preponderated in favor of the verdict.
The judgment of the court below will therefore be affirmed without damages, with the assurance, however, that in future when parties elect to submit their cases upon a suggestion of delay, seeking thereby to gain precedence over other cases ahead of them on the docket, no liberality will be indulged in their favor by examining the record further than we are required to do by the rule.
Let the judgment of the court below be affirmed without damages.

219183,M. J. Dooley et al. v. M. M. Miller,1893-01-17,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This controversy involves the title to a lot of jewelry, recovered by appellee from M. J. Dooley and G. W. Cotter, appellants. It became a material inquiry on the trial in the court below, whether the jewelry was the property of appellee M. M. Miller, or her son, R. A. Miller, as a member of the firm of R. A. Miller & Co., of which firm appellant M. J. Dooley was the other partner. The jewelry had been deposited with appellant Cotter, to indemnify him as the surety of the firm for a firm debt, which debt was afterwards paid. Dooley claimed that the jewelry had not only been deposited for this purpose, but also that it had become a part of the firm assets. This was denied by appellee and her son, R. A. Miller.
The first assignment of error complains of the exclusion of testimony, as appears from the bill of exceptions, substantially as follows: “The plaintiff having introduced the witness R. A. Miller, after the conclusion of the direct examination of said witness, defendant’s counsel, on cross-examination, asked the witness the following question: ‘ Did you or not, on or about the-day of January, 1887, write a certain letter to defendant M. J. Dooley, in which you stated that you would send to Louisr ville, Kentucky, and redeem certain jewelry, and after you secured the same you would put it into the business of R. A. Miller die Co., and defendant M. J. Dooley could use it, or sell it to raise money for said business ?’ To which said witness replied that he did not write any such letter. Whereupon defendant’s counsel exhibited a certain letter, of date -day of January, 1887, purporting to have been written by said witness R. A. Miller to said defendant M. J. Dooley, and asked said witness if he wrote said letter, to which said witness replied that he did; and after plaintiff had closed her testimony, defendant M. J. Dooley offered said letter, dated-day of January, 1887, purporting to have been written by said witness to defendant M. J. Dooley, and containing in it the statement that witness R. A. Miller would send to Louisville, Kentucky, and redeem certain jewelry, and after he received it he would put it into the business of R. A. Miller & Co., and said defendant M. J. Dooley could use it, or sell it to raise money for said business.”
The first objection urged by appellee to the introduction of this testimony was, that she had called the witness only to prove the purpose for which the property had been pledged, to-wit, to secure the firm debt, and that this debt had been paid, and that she had interrogated the witness only on these issues. This objection is not sustained by the record. In his testimony in chief the witness stated, “ Said jewelry is my mother’s, and has always been.”
The second objection was, that the declaration was not shown to have come to the knowledge of appellee, and she could not be bound thereby.
The third and last objection was, that it was an immaterial inquiry, and hence the witness could not be contradicted thereon.
It seems perfectly clear to us that the testimony was admissible, at least to contradict and discredit the witness. The evidence was very conflicting between witnesses for plaintiff and defendants below, and therefore the question of credibility was one of prime importance. Miller & English v. Jannett, 63 Texas, 82. The exclusion of this evidence, therefore, necessitates a reversal of the judgment.
Complaint is also made of the court’s action in giving and refusing charges. Without reviewing in detail the charges given and refused, in view of another trial, we suggest that if the pleadings and proof should be substantially the same as this record discloses, that the following issues should by appropriate instructions be submitted:
1. Whether or not the property belonged to appellee.
2. If the title to the property was in her, whether or not, by her consent, it had become a part of the assets of the firm of R. A. Miller & Co., as claimed by Dooley.
If the jury should find the affirmative of the first isssue, and the negative of the second, the verdict should be for appellee, otherwise it should be against her.

219081,E. A. Paffrath v. The State of Texas,1893-01-17,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On the 22d day of November, 1886, one S. M. Hutchins filed his application and affidavit in compliance with the regulations adopted by the State Land Board on December 2, 1885, to purchase the land in controversy as agricultural land, under sections 6 and 8 of the Act of 1883. In said application it is stipulated, among other things, as follows:
“It is'further understood, that any violation of any of the provisions of the law, or any violation of the rules and regulations of the State Land Board prescribing the manner of purchasing said lands, or a failure to settle upon and improve the land within ninety days from date of award by the board, or any failure to make any of the payments required by law or said regulations, shall work a forfeiture of all money paid on, and all claims to said land, without judicial proceedings. It being understood and agreed that the object of the sale to me is for the purpose of securing a bona fide settler on the land.”
Upon this application the land was awarded by the board to Hutchins on December 20,1886. On the 16th day of August, 1887, said Hutchins, joined by his wife, without ever having settled upon the land in compliance with his contract or the law, by deed conveyed all his interest in the land to appellant, Paffrath. Appellant has also failed to settle upon the land. This suit was instituted by the State on August 21, 1890, to recover the land in controversy, alleging the forfeiture by Hutchins and his vendee Paffrath, by reason of their failure to make settlement as required by the law and their contract. Upon the trial of the case in the court below judgment was rendered for appellee, from which this appeal is taken.
The only question of importance presented in the brief of appellant is the failure of the court below at Ms request to charge the jury that the State was barred of its right of action by failing to institute this suit within one year, as, it is claimed, is required by section 6 of the law under which this purchase was made. That section of the law is as follows:
“Lands when placed upon the market shall be sold in the county or land district in which it is situated, under such authority and under such system of competition as may be prescribed by said Land Board: Provided, that no person, either in person or by agent, shall purchase from the State more than one section of land classed as agricultural land or as watered land, or seven sections of unwatered land: Provided, the board may in their discretion require the purchaser of any particular section of watered pasture land to take with the same such a number of dry sections as they may designate, not to exceed seven sections; and every attempt to evade the limitation of this act as to the amount or class of land one may purchase, by any device whatever, shall be deemed fraudulent, and the fraud may be shown and the purchase cancelled by the State within one year from the date of sale: Provided, that the agricultural lands shall be sold only to actual settlers,” etc.
Section 8 provides: “That no sale of agricultural land shall be perfected until the proposed purchaser files an affidavit that he intends that the land shall be actually settled within six months; and in case of failure to settle the same within that time the proposed purchaser shall forfeit the money already paid on the land.”
We are of opinion that the limitation prescribed by section 6 does not apply to the case made by this record. The limitation prescribed by that section was intended to fix a time within which fraud perpetrated at the time the contract was entered into could be investigated, and was not intended to have application to a failure on the part of the purchaser to comply with a contract made in good faith at the time it was entered into. If appellant had induced the Land Board to award him agricultural land under a contract for pasture land, or had attempted to purchase more land than he was entitled to under the law, this limitation would apply; but we find no intention disclosed by this statute to relieve a purchaser from the forfeiture declared for a failure to comply with his contract to purchase, the contract itself being valid at the time it was made.
The only question submitted by the court in its charge was as to whether or not the purchaser Hutchins had settled on the land within six months after the 20th day of December, 1886; and the jury having found that he had not, we are of opinion that the limitation of one year prescribed by section 6 did not bar the State.
Let the j udgment of the court below be in all things affirmed.

219265,D. D. Swearingen v. T. C. Wilson,1893-01-24,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
Appellee T. C. Wilson sued C. W. Israel- & Co., in the District Court of Wichita County, for a debt amounting to $2818.85, and on the 16th day of December made affidavit and gave bond to obtain writs of garnishment against J. T. Craig, the State National-Bank of Fort Worth, and the City National Bank of Fort Worth; and on the 30th day of December, 1887, plaintiff filed an additional affidavit and application to obtain a writ of garnishment against appellant, D. D. Swearingen, whose residence was alleged to be in Hardeman County, Texas; but to obtain this garnishment no additional bond was given.
Appellant first filed his motion to quash the garnishment against him upon several grounds, among which was the failure of appellee to give bond at the time the garnishment against him was sued out. This motion does not appear from the transcript to have been acted upon, unless the following entry therein should be taken as a part of the record to show that this had been done, to-wit:
“ 182. T. C. Wilson v. D. D. Swearingen, garnishee. Cobb & Boyd. Motion to quash writ of garnishment and dismiss suit. November 12, 1890,. Overruled 5d 3 w.”
On April 24, 1888, appellant answered the writ of garnishment, and after denying any indebtedness to defendants, or either of them, in the usual form, added to his answer the following: “ Defendant D. D. Swearingen, the garnishee herein, further answering, says, that on or about the-day of May, 1886, he purchased from one John Craig, who was acting as assignee of C. W. Israel & Co., or J. N. Israel and C. W. Israel, certain bank fixtures for the sum of $800, and thereupon gave his promissory note for said sum, payable to said John A. Craig as assignee of C. W. Israel & Co , or J. N. Israel and C. W. Israel. That said note was not payable until all litigation between John A. Craig as assignee and the creditors of said bank was settled. Defendant says that he does not know who is now the owner of said note herein referred to, but is informed that said note has been transferred by said Craig to other parties. Wherefore he asks that the said John Craig, as assignee as aforesaid, who is a resident of Clay County, Texas, be made a party to this proceeding, and that citation issue to him commanding him to appear and answer whether or not he as assignee is the owner of said note, and' if not, then to answer who is the owner of said note. Defendant asks that he be allowed a fee of $50 as attorney fee for preparing an answer in this proceeding.”
The record does not show that Craig was ever served with citation or appeared in the case. On the 19th of November, 1890, judgment was rendered against the garnishee for the sum of $770, with interest from the 14th of February, 1886, at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, aggregating the sum of $1135.75, and in favor of appellant for all costs, including the $50 attorney fee claimed in his answer, and adjudging that this judgment be a bar in his favor against all liability upon his debt to C. W. Israel & Co. This judgment recites that both plaintiff and garnishee appeared by their attorneys, and that all matters of fact as well as of law were submitted to the court, and the court, after hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, and being fully advised in the premises, finds that the garnishee D. D. Swearingen was indebted to C. W. Israel & Co. as above set forth. No affidavit seems ever to have been filed controverting the answer of the garnishee, nor does it appear affirmatively from the record that any issues, either written or verbal, were made up under the direction of the court, as required by the statute. It does not appear from the record that the garnishee ever made any objection to the’trial of the case in Wichita County on account of his residence in Hardeman. Ho statement of facts or special findings accompany the record.
We are of opinion that the purported copy in the transcript from the motion docket should not be treated as a part of the record. In the case of Stark v. Miller, 63 Texas, 164, it is said: “ The judge’s notes are for his own convenience and that of the clerk making the entries, and form no part of the record, and in case of a discrepancy between these notes and an entry in the minutes, the latter would prevail.” Whittaker v. Gee, 63 Texas, 435; Eastham v. Sallis, 60 Texas, 576. We think the only effect that should be given to this entry would be to enable the parties to have an order entered nunc pro tune showing the action of the court upon this motion. Ximenes v. Ximenes, 43 Texas, 458.
The record not showing that the motion was called to the attention of the court below, or that any objection was insisted upon by the garnishee to the alleged irregularities in obtaining the garnishment, it will not be necessary for us to consider several interesting questions presented by the brief of appellant.
The action of the court in proceeding with the trial of this case without requiring the issues to be formed as required by the statute certainly presents grave irregularities, but we are not prepared to hold that they are such as must be deemed fatal to the judgment. It seems that appellant entered into the trial without making any objection on account of the failure of appellee to file a controverting affidavit, and without taking any steps to have formal issues made. The contest seems to have been waged not to test the truth or falsity of any of the statements made in the answer of the garnishee, but only to show that by reason of the facts therein stated the note therein named as due to Craig, assignee, should be held liable for the debts of the assignor C. W. Israel & Co., and in such case it does not seem to us that a controverting affidavit would be necessary. Appellee did not controvert any of the statements made in the answer, and he therefore could not have sworn that the answer of the garnishee was not correct. See Moursund v. Priess, 84 Texas, 554.
The failure to form the issues before entering into the trial, however, presents a more difficult question. It has been held that our statute in such cases does not require formal pleadings (Insurance Company v. Willis & Bro., 70 Texas, 12; Davis & Bro. v. McCormick, 2 Willson’s Civil Cases, 628); and it has also been held that these issues may by consent be joined verbally and need not be in writing (Kelly v. Gibbs, 84 Texas, 143); and after a careful consideration of the question we are of opinion, that under the recitals in this judgment we ought to presume that the parties did by consent form the necessary verbal issues to sustain it, and that appellant having gone through the trial without objecting to the manner of proceeding, should not now be heard to complain that the record fails to show that the necessary issues were made. It was as much •his duty to see that the necessary issues were formed as it was that of his adversary.
We think it clear that the objection that the trial was had in a county other than that of the residence of appellant comes too late when presented for the first time in this court. Bonner & Eddy v. Hearne, 75 Texas, 251.
We are therefore of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be in all things affirmed.

A motion for rehearing was refused."
219181,The Fort Worth & Denver City Railway Company v. Robert Thompson,1893-01-24,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
The appellee, Robert Thompson, sustained the personal injuries on account of which he brought this suit while he was in the employ of appellant railway company as an engineer, and at a point on appellant’s line of railway about three miles northwest of Henrietta, Clay County, Texas. He was at the time of the injury, on April 21, 1885, engaged in propelling backwards, with tender in front, the engine of which he was in charge, with two cabooses. It was derailed, and plaintiff was seriously scalded and bruised. The evidence justifies two conclusions which, in our opinion, the verdict of the jury imports, namely: (1) That the injuries were due to a low joint in the line of defendant’s railway caused by the negligence of the company in failing to properly inspect and repair its track. (2) That the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence, as charged by appellant, in running the engine at a dangerous and reckless speed.
Appellant first assigns as error the action of the court in excluding the evidence of the witness Ford, by whom it offered to prove that “ an engine with tender in front and two cabooses, in the condition of this train, could not be run with safety with a greater rate of speed than from ten to fifteen miles per hour.” This witness was a lawyer by profession, and had been engaged as a claim agent for the defendant company. While thus engaged he posted himself “ thoroughly as to the construction of engines, watched them in the shops, questioned the engineers about them, and noticed the effects of the speed of a train.” He was in the habit of “ riding on the engines perhaps two-thirds of his time with the engineers and other railroad boys, and would fire for them and frequently run their engines.” When asked as to his ability to testify regarding the comparative safety of running an engine backward, he answered: “ I can only answer from my conversations with engineers and mechanics and the results I have seen from running at a high rate of speed.”
We are not prepared to say that the trial court erred in declining to consider this witness as an expert with reference to the subject about which he was called to testify. He does not appear to have been educated in this business, or to have any ‘1 special knowledge and skill in the particular calling to which the inquiry relates.” Goldstein v. Black, 50 Cal., 462.
In its second assignment of error appellant complains, that the court erred in refusing to permit it to prove by the witness J. G. Williams, conductor of the train at the time of the injury, that “ ordinarily the defendant keeps its track in good condition.” This language, as we interpret it, imports that the company is in the habit of keeping its track in good condition. The court correctly held such evidence to be immaterial. Another portion of the bill of exceptions raising the assignment indicates that the purpose of appellant’s counsel might have been to prove that the defendant exercised ordinary care ‘1 in building up low joints and in keeping its track in good condition.” To this end the witness was asked to state “ whether or not the defendant was ordinarily careful in building up low joints and in keeping its track in good condition ?” The answer to this question, in our opinion, could but have expressed the opinion of the witness as to the exercise of ordinary care by the defendant. The question of ordinary care vel non is one peculiarly of fact, to be determined by the jury, and not of opinion to be fixed by a witness. The general rule applies here, that “ witnesses must testify to facts and not to opinions.”
We do not think that appellant can reasonably complain of the action of the court in permitting the appellee to prove that “ fast mail trains on well ballasted roads could run safety at the rate of sixty miles an hour.” In an inquiry of this kind, involving as it did the rate of speed at which the train was running at the time of the accident, it was not improper that the jury should be made acquainted with all the different conditions under which a train could be operated with greater or less rapidity.
The court did not err in permitting plaintiff to testify as to the length of time he had been out of employment. There is no merit in appellant’s proposition that such proof -was without basis in plaintiff’s pleading. The petition averred that on account of the injuries he was “ confined to his bed for the space of about three months,” and u that by reason thereof he has been disabled and prevented from pursuing his occupation.”
Appellant complains of the refusal of the court to grant the following special instruction asked by it:
“ If the jury should determine from the evidence that the cause of the wreck, if you should find that there was a wreck, was what the witnesses term a low joint, and if you further find that low joints are common to railroads generally, which fact was known, or could have been by plaintiff by the exercise of ordinary care, plaintiff will be held to have assumed any risk that may have arisen from said low joint, and can not recover.”
This instruction was property rejected. The injury complained of was due to a derailment of the train. If this derailment is to be ascribed to a low joint, there is no evidence that low joints of such a character “ are common to railroads generally.” It is quite elementary that an instruction should be refused unless it rests upon evidence. Besides, the instruction is subject to the criticism that it gives undue prominence to a special feature of the evidence as indicating contributory negligence. Railway v. Shearer, 1 Texas Civ. App., 343.
Appellant in its fifth assignment of error complains of the rejection by the court of its following special instruction:
“ It is the duty of a railway company to use ordinary care in the construction and maintenance of its roadway, and to keep it in a reasonably safe condition for proper use. It was the duty of plaintiff to conform to the reasonable and known rules and orders of the defendant regulating the rate of speed at which trains should be propelled over its roadway; and if you believe that defendant’s roadway was in a reasonably safe condition, and that its trains with safety might have been propelled over its said railway at a reasonable rate of speed, not in excess of the rate prescribed by said company, and that plaintiff of his own accord propelled said train over said roadbed at a higher rate of speed than was required of him by said company, and that such increased rate of speed caused or contributed to the cause of the derailment of the engine or' train by reason of which plaintiff may have sustained injury, you will find for defendant. ’ ’
The instruction was properly refused:
First. The charge of the court had sufficiently guarded the rights of the defendant on its plea of contributory negligence. The court had instructed the jury, that “ where a person enters into the service of a railway company he assumes all the risks ordinarily incident to the service in which he engages, and he can not recover for an injury received in such service unless the injury be caused by the negligence of the company, and without fault on his part contributing thereto.” Again : “ Unless you believe that the alleged injury was caused by negligence on the part of the defendant’s agents having charge and maintenance of its roadbed, without fault on the part of plaintiff contributing thereto, you should find for the defendant.” Again: “ If the plaintiff’s injuries were caused by his own negligence, and not by reason of a defective track, as alleged, or if you believe that the plaintiff, in running his engine over said track, himself failed to use that care which a person of ordinary prudence would have used with the knowledge possessed by him, and that such want of care on his part contributed to the alleged injury, you will find for the defendant.”
Second. The special instruction, in effect, included the proposition, that the fact of running at a greater speed than was permitted by the rules of the company was of itself negligence. This would have been in contravention of the rule forbidding the trial court to say, in the absence of statutory declaration, that any particular act or omission constitutes negligence. Railway v. Lee, 70 Texas, 501; Railway v. Roberts, ante, p. 111.
A careful inspection of the court’s charge constrains us to dissent from appellant’s very general assignment of error, that the charge does not “ present the law applicable to the case, and does not present all the questions material to a correct determination of the case.”
We are thus brought to consider the question of fact presented in the several concluding assignments and propositions of appellant, namely: Did the evidence justify the verdict? There is no controversy with reference to the extent and gravity of the injuries sustained by the appellee. We have scrutinized the very voluminous statement of facts, and concluded, as already indicated, that the derailment of the train, and the consequent injuries sustained by the appellee, are most reasonably to be ascribed to a low joint of unusual character in appellant’s track; that this low joint might have been avoided or corrected by a proper inspection of the track, which appellant failed to give to it; and while there was a sharp conflict in the evidence with reference to the speed at which the appellee was operating the engine, there was sufficient testimony to warrant the finding by the jury that he was not guilty of contributory negligence.
The judgment is therefore affirmed.

219118,R. O. Prideaux v. W. L. Glasgow et al.,1893-01-31,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
In April, 1879, the land in controversy being vacant public domain, one William Hutton settled thereon and made such improvements as entitled him to be classed as an actual settler under the Act of May 26,1873. Hutton remained upon the land until in the summer of 1881, when on account of the excessively dry weather he moved his family with his flock of sheep about eight miles, to obtain water, and never afterward returned thereto with his family, although a part of his furniture remained in the house until the summer or fall of 1882, and the forage for his stock which was raised on the place in 1881 remained thereon. In July, 1880, Hutton made application in writing to the proper surveyor to have this land surveyed for him as a pre-emptian homestead, but this application was not accompanied with an affidavit as required by law. The surveyor, however, surveyed the land and returned the field notes with this application to the Land Office in August, 1880. In November, 1883, Hutton filed his own and two supporting affidavits, proving three years occupancy by him as required by law, with the Commissioner of the General Land Office. In May, 1883, Hutton, joined by his wife, conveyed all his interest in the land in controversy to appellant, who has never resided upon it. In February, 1890, appellees settled upon different parts of this land for the purpose of acquiring preemption homesteads thereon. They made the necessary applications and affidavits, and had the survey made and the field notes returned to the General Land Office in compliance with the law to entitle them to the land, if at that time it was vacant public domain. In 1884, appellant applied to the Commissioner of the General Land Office for patent on the I-Iutton claim, and was informed that this land was embraced in an older survey, and as appellant was then the owner of such older survey, he made no further effort to procure the patent until after the settlement by, and the surveys for, appellees were made; but when he learned of this adverse claim, he again applied to the Commissioner for a patent, which was issued in the name of William Hutton, on the 8th day of August, 1890. The field notes of appellees’ surveys were filed in the General Land Office July 11, 1890.
The case was tried by the court below without a jury, and judgment was rendered in favor of appellees for that part of the land covered by their claims, and in favor of appellant for the remainder.
No special findings of law or fact accompany the record.
At the time appellees made their settlement, the land was enclosed in the pasture of appellant, and they were notified by him that he claimed it under the Hutton settlement.
There being no special findings of fact in the record, we think the judgment rendered by the court below must be held to import a finding that I-Iutton’s application was not accompanied by the necessary affidavit to authorize a survey for him under the pre-emption laws in force at the time of such application. That the failure to accompany his application with such an affidavit is fatal to the claim of appellant, seems to be settled by the decisions of our Supreme Court. Miller v. Moss, 65 Texas, 179; Bledsoe v. Cains, 10 Texas, 455; 1 Sayles’ Real Estate Laws of Texas, sec. 322.
Appellant contends, that under the evidence the court should have presumed that the necessary application and affidavit were made by Hutton. It is true that Hutton swears that he made an application and had a survey made in 1879, and it may be that had the court found in favor of appellant, we would have been constrained to hold that the evidence justified such finding; but the court having taken a different view of the evidence, and, as we must presume, having found .that the only application that was made was the one returned to the Land Office in 1880, and that this application was not accompanied by the necessary affidavit, we must hold that such finding was justified by the evidence in support of the judgment rendered. We are also not prepared to say that a finding by the court below that Hutton had permanently abandoned the place before he had occupied it the full three years would not be sustained by the evidence. It is true that a mere temporary absence would not work a forfeiture of such a claim (Bledsoe v. Cains, supra; Calvert v. Ramsey, 59 Texas, 490); but it may be that the court viewed the evidence in this case as showing an intention on the part of Hutton not again to make his-home upon this land; and if such was the finding, we would hardly be-be authorized to disturb the judgment.
Let the judgment of the court below be in all things affirmed.

219226,Ashby S. James et al. v. J. H. Lamb et al.,1893-01-31,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
In September, 1885, one William Still undertook to purchase from the State, through the Land Board, 333 acres of school land situated in Wichita County. He applied to purchase it as agricultural land, and obligated himself to live upon it as an actual settler, as provided by the law then in force. The sale to him in accordance with the regulations of the Land Board was not in compliance with the Act of 1883, and did not confer title upon him, among other reasons, because the sale was not made in the county or district where the land was situated, as required under that act. He also failed to become an actual settler. The State v. Opperman, 74 Texas, 136; Martin v. McCarty, 74 Texas, 128.
In March, 1887, he conveyed this land by warranty deed to appellant James, who assumed the payment of the notes executed by Still to the State. James likewise failed to become an actual settler, and in February, 1889, conveyed the same by a deed with covenant of general warranty to appellee J. H. Lamb and one Edwards. Lamb and Edwards paid James $200 cash, and executed four negotiable promissory notes for $294.05 each, and assumed the payment of the original Still notes, in consideration of this conveyance from James. Soon thereafter appellee Lamb acquired the interest of Edwards, ■ and became an actual settler upon the land and continued to reside thereon.
When the act, passed April 8, 1889 (page 50), giving preference in the sale of school land to the actual settler took effect, he was residing upon the land. Soon thereafter he seems to have applied to the State, under the law then in force, to purchase this land; and this was followed by a suit to recover from appellant James the $200 previously paid him, and to have the notes, then in the possession of the Panhandle National Bank, cancelled. As grounds of recovery, he charged that appellant James had fraudulently represented himself to have title when he had none; that he had been deceived and defrauded in the transaction; and also alleged a breach of the covenant of general warranty. These allegations of fraud were wholly unsustained by the proof, and that issue was not submitted to the jury. The State intervened in this suit (presumptively at the instance of Lamb), and obtained a cancellation, as against appellant James, of the original contract of purchase made in the name of William Still.
Appellee Lamb recovered judgment against James for the $200, and against appellant bank for the cancellation of the notes. From that judgment this appeal is prosecuted.
The court submitted as the measure of damages for a breach of the warranty, the purchase money paid and secured to appellant James, as set forth above. In his original petition, appellee Lamb alleged that in order to protect himself in the use, occupation, and enjoyment of the land, and to save the improvements he had placed thereon, he had been compelled to purchase and acquire title to the same from the State of Texas. In his first supplemental petition, in reply to the answer of appellant James, he alleged that he was in possession of the land described in his petition, holding the same from and under the State of Texas and pursuant to the law of the land, and not under the void title sold him by James.
The only assignments of error presented by appellants which seem to us to be well taken relate to the question of the measure of damages. The correctness of the rule followed in the trial below is not questioned in cases where the title has failed and the purchaser has lost the land. It seems to us, however, that this rule is not applicable to the case here submitted, inasmuch as appellee Lamb admits in his pleadings that he has acquired a title from the State, which we understand to mean that he has acquired such title as appellant James purported to convey to him. We are of opinion that the loss which he has sustained, if any, in securing by purchase from the State such right to the land as he would have acquired under the deed from James had the original purchase of Still been valid, is the true measure of his damages, as compensation for this loss will place him in statu quo. His purpose, as contemplated by all parties, in acquiring the land in the first instance seems to have been that he might settle upon it and enjoy it as a home, and after making full payment to the State, receive a patent. To the extent that the failure of the title which James’ deed purported to convey rendered the accomplishment of this result more onerous and expensive to appellee, appellant James should respond in damages on his warranty.
Appellee Lamb relies upon the cases of Wheeler v. Styles, 28 Texas, 240, and Rodgers v. Daily, 46 Texas, 578, as authority for the proposition, that where the land sold turns out to be vacant public domain, the vendee may resist the payment of the purchase money, or recover it back when paid, without a surrender of the possession to the vendor, and at the same time acquire from the State a title to the vacant land. In each of those cases the contract of purchase was executory, there being only a bond for title and no covenant of warranty; hence the correctness of the rule as therein applied is not questioned. Where the contract is executed and a warranty of title is relied upon, as in this case, in the absence of fraud or other circumstances which would authorize a cancellation of the contract, we think it must be held that the covenant of warranty is a suffieient consideration for the money paid and notes executed to obtain the warranty deed, and that the proper remedy is for damages for a breach of the warranty.
In the case of McClelland v. Moore, 48 Texas, 363, there was such a conveyance and covenant; and the land sold had been surveyed, but the certificate by virtue of which it had been surveyed was not returned to the General Land Office within the time required, and the survey , was therefore forfeited and the land became subject to reappropriation. Thevendee had it located and surveyed by virtue of a certificate belonging-to him, and subsequently obtained a patent for it. In that case the rule was announced and applied, that “ when the covenantee purchases the-paramount title, the measure of damages is the actual loss thereby sustained; it is incumbent on the purchaser, in order to recover more than nominal damages, to prove the amount paid by him to extinguish the paramount title.” We think this rule should be followed in measuringappellees’ damages; compensation for the loss sustained being the desideratum of all the rules.
For the error of the court in submitting to the jury an incorrect rule-for measuring the damages, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.

219248,Victor Beze v. Priscilla Calvert,1893-01-11,"KEY, Associate Justice.
This is an action of trespass to try title, commenced May 14, 1885, by Priscilla Calvert, Mattie Shelby, Alfred Shelby, and Mary Watkins, against Victor Beze, John Twohig, Angel Martinez, and Benito Lopez. The plaintiffs’ petition described the land sued for as follows: “Two thousand acres of land in Wilson County, Texas, bounded and described as follows, to-wit: Beginning at the lower corner of the Arocha eight leagues grant, at the mouth of the Pajaritos Creek; thence up said creek with its meanders, and with the southeast boundary line of said survey, 2200 varas to a stake set on said line for the northwest corner of- Hernandez survey; thence with the back line of Hernandez survey south 61° east 2460 varas to a stake; thence south 50° west 4850 varas to the San Antonio River; thence up said river with its meanders to the beginning.”
The defendants Lopez and Beze filed pleas of not guilty and five and ten years statutes of limitations. Defendant Martinez disclaimed, and before trial plaintiffs dismissed as to defendant Twohig.
Mary 1ST. Cortez, Rusu de Cortez, Jennie Davis Cortez, Amelia Laplace, Josephine Summars, Alice Laplace, Clemente (Jortez, John Carr, Emma Carr, Clara Carr, Maria Carr, and Maud Evite Kunneman intervened, and claimed the land as the heirs of Juan Cortez.
October 12, 1888, J. B. Dibrell, administrator of the estate of the plaintiff Priscilla Calvert, made himself a party plaintiff.
December 3, 1889, plaintiffs and intervenors dismissed as to defendant Lopez.
The cause was tried, and upon a verdict of a jury to that effect, judgment was rendered for plaintiffs for the land, and for defendant Victor Beze for $300, the value of his improvements. The latter and the intervenors have prosecuted appeals.
The briefs of appellant and intervenors present a number of questions; but we decide the case on one point only.
The deed executed by J. C. Morgan, as deputy sheriff of Bexar County, to Thomas M. Dennis, dated October 2, 1839, constitutes a link in the chain of title upon which the plaintiffs and the intervenors rest their claims to the land involved. The introduction of this deed in evidence was objected to by appellant Victor Beze, because of its failure to describe the land in controversy. Error is assigned upon the action of the court in overruling this objection.
The deed describes the land which it purports to convey as follows: 6 £All the right, title, and claims of the said Mariano Rodiguez in and to the aforesaid interest in the old Hernandez tract, the said interest being one-half of that part and portion of the said tract which was transferred to the Manchacas; the said part and portion being on the east bank of the San Antonio River, below and adjoining the lands of the Arochas, commencing at Pajaritos Creek and running down, and known as the Manchaca tract, the interest and half of the same above sold and herein conveyed being the upper half.”
The only preceding references in this instrument to the land it purports to convey are contained in the following extracts therefrom: “Which said execution was by the said J. C. Morgan, deputy sheriff as aforesaid, levied upon divers real properties (therebeing no goods or chattels found), to-wit: *' * * and an interest in a tract of land known as the old Hernandez tract on the San Antonio River,” and, “I, the aforesaid deputy sheriff and party of the first part in this indenture, did on the specified day offer the same, to-wit, the aforesaid interest in the Hernandez tract, for sale.”
The rule is well settled, that less indulgence will be shown in favor of descriptions of property contained in deeds based on compulsory sales under judicial process than applies to descriptions given in deeds and other instruments voluntarily executed by the owner of the property. And in the former class of cases, if there is a patent ambiguity in the description of the land, it can not be aided by paroi evidence, and the deed is void. Wofford v. McKinna, 23 Texas, 36; Norris v. Hunt, 51 Texas, 615; Mitchell v. Ireland, 54 Texas, 301; Wooters v. Arledge, 54 Texas, 395.
In our opinion, the description contained in the deed under consideration involves more than one patent ambiguity, which, considered in the aggregate, render it void for uncertainty. For instance, it does not name the county, state, or other political division wherein the land is situated; it does not give the name of the original survey of which the land conveyed is a part, but merely calls it “ the old Hernandez tract;” it describes the land conveyed as “ one half ” of the portion of said Hernandez tract transferred to the Manchacas, without disclosing whether the “ one half” so conveyed isa segregated moiety of, cran undivided interest in, the whole of the Manchaca tract; it calls it one half the portion which was transferred to the Manchacas, but fails to show when or by whom it was transferred, and to how many and which of the Manchacas the transfer was made, and the quantity of land so transferred to them; and gives no other means of identifying the Manchaca land than the statement that it is on the east bank of the San Antonio River, below and adjoining the lands of the Arochas, commencing at Pajaritos Creek and running down, and known as the Manchaca tract. And the final clause, “ the interest and half of the same above sold and herein conveyed, being the upper half,” is equally as uncertain. If “ the interest” constitutes the upper half, it is difficult to perceive how ‘' half of the same ’ ’ can also be the upper half. And the word “upper” may mean up the river, up the creek, or the natural ascent of the land.
The plaintiffs and intervenors having failed to show any title in either of them to the land in controversy, and for which they are suing, the judgment of the District Court will be reversed, and judgment here rendered, that they take nothing by their suit and pay all costs of both courts.
Reversed and rendered.
Delivered January 11, 1893."
219165,Leon & H. Blum v. W. R. Bratton,1893-01-18,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
The appellants Leon & H. Blum, as creditors of J. H. Brodie & Co., sued out a writ of attachment from the District Court of Comanche County, which was levied by the appellant T. E. Wilson, sheriff of Comanche County, upon a stock of merchandise in the possession of the appellee, W. R. Bratton, who claimed the same as assignee of the firm of J. H. Brodie & Co. Appellee brought suit against the appellants for the conversion of the said stock of merchandise. Trial was before the court without a jury. There was a judgment in favor of the appellee for $1881.56, from which judgment appellants prosecute this appeal.
We find the facts to be as follows:
1. That J. H. Brodie & Co., a firm composed of J. H. Brodie and W. B. Brodie, was before the 1st day of October, 1889, engaged in the mercantile business in Comanche, Texas.
2. That said firm was on the 1st day of October, 1889. insolvent, and that upon that day the firm, through W. B. Brodie, made and delivered to appellee the following deed of assignment, to-wit:
''■The State of Texas, County of Comanche.—This indenture, made this 1st day of October, A. D. 1889, by and between J. H. Brodie & Co. and W. R. Bratton, all of Comanche County, witnesseth: That whereas the said J. H. Brodie & Co. are jointly indebted in divers sums of money, which they are unable to pay in full, to different creditors, whose names are stated in the annexed list, and they desire to make a fair distribution of their property and assets among those of their creditors who will consent to accept their proportional share of their estate and discharge them from their respective claims in accordance with the statute.
“Now therefore, in consideration of the premises and of the sum of one dollar to them in hand paid by the said W. R. Bratton, the said J. H. Brodie & Co. do by these presents bargain, sell, convey, release, and set over unto the said W. R. Bratton all their real and personal estate, other than that which is by law exempted from execution, to have and to hold, unto him, the said W. R. Bratton and his successors, in trust for the benefit of the creditors of the said J. H. Brodie & Co. as aforesaid. And the said W. R. Bratton on his part covenants and agrees to faithfully perform his duties as assignee in accordance with the statute concerning assignments for the benefit of creditors.
“ In testimony whereof, witness our hands, October 1, 1889.
“ J. H. Brodie & Co.,
6* By W. B. Brodie.”
This assignment was duly and properly acknowledged on the 1st day of October, 1889, by the said W. B. Brodie for the firm of J. H. Brodie & Co., before a notary public of Comanche County, Texas.
3. That at the time of the execution and delivery of the deed of assignment, and before that time, J. H. Brodie was an absconding debtor, and left the stock of merchandise of the firm in the possession of W. B. Brodie.
4. That W. B. Brodie had paroi consent from J. H. Brodie to execute the deed of assignment.
5. That J. H. Brodie, at the time of the execution and the delivery of the deed of assignment, had no other property than his interest in the firm of J. H. Brodie & Co.
6. It appears that the property of J. H. Brodie & Co. is a stock of merchandise and accounts, etc., and is wholly personal property.
7. That W. R. Bratton, appellee, duly and legally qualified as assignee under such deed of. assignment, and that J. H. Brodie filed, as required by law, a list and schedule of the creditors and inventory and assets of the property and estate of J. H. Brodie & Co., and the same were duly recorded, etc.
8. That appellants have a valid debt against J. H. Brodie & Co. in the amount of $3325.97, and that suit was filed on said debt in the District Court of Comanche County, and that an attachment was issued and levied on the goods transferred by the deed of assignment by the appellants.
9. That the value of the goods levied upon by the writ of attachment is the sum of $1881.56.
Objections were made in the court below to the evidence of witnesses Hamilton, W. B. Brodie, and Cunningham, as to certain statements made by J. II. Brodie before he left Comanche, and before the assignment was made, tending to show his purpose to be to make an assignment of the property of J. H. Brodie & Co., and also tending to show that he authorized W. B. Brodie to execute the assignment. Objection is also made to evidence showing that J. H. Brodie had no property other than his interest in the firm assets.
Without entering into a discussion of this question and giving our reasons in full, we hold that the evidence objected to was admissible. Coffin v. Douglass, 61 Texas, 406; McKee v. Coffin, 66 Texas, 307.
The next question raised is, that paroi authority given by J. H. Brodie was not sufficient to authorize W. B. Brodie to execute the assignment so as to bind the members of the firm.
The evidence shows, that the assets of the firm are personal property, and that J. H. Brodie owned no other property, and that he authorized his partner, W. B. Brodie, to make the assignment if he did not hear from him by a certain day. Failing to hear from J. H. Brodie within the time agreed, W. B. Brodie executed the deed of assignment.
These facts sufficiently authorized W. B. Brodie to execute the assignment, and it is binding upon him as well as J. H. Brodie. McKee v. Coffin, 66 Texas, 307.
The next question to be considered is, Does the deed of assignment pass the individual property of the partners as well as the assets of the firm ? We think it does. The terms employed in the instrument are in many respects similar to those passed upon in the cases of Shoe Company v. Ferrell, 68 Texas, 638; Coffin v. Douglass, 61 Texas, 406; and Mc-Guffin v. Sowell, 1 Texas Civil Appeals, 187.
The court in those cases holds, that the instruments are sufficient to pass the individual property of the members of the firm as well as the firm property.
We find no error in the record, and affirm the judgment.
Affirmed.

219262,A. B. Frank & Co. v. K. O. de Lopez et al.,1893-01-25,"FISHER, Chief Justice.
March 13, 1890, appellant instituted this suit in the County Court of Wilson County against appellees. General and special demurrers were addressed to the petition. The court below sustained all of the demurrers, and appellant declining to amend, his action was dismissed.
The petition is as follows:
“ Your petitioners, A. B. Frank & Co., a firm transacting a commercial business in the city of San Antonio, county of Bexar, State of Texas, and •composed of A. B. Frank, who resides in the county of Bexar, and M. Goldfrank and Simon Lavenberg, who reside in the State of New York, herein after styled plaintiffs, complaining of Karolina O. de Lopez, who resides in the county of Wilson, and of John Kusch and George Schroeder, who reside in the county of Bexar, State aforesaid, and who will herein ■after be styled defendants, shows unto your honor:
“ 1. That heretofore, to-wit, on the 9th day of August, 1888, Benito Lopez died in Wilson County, leaving an estate of himself and his wife in said county.
“ 2. That the said Karolina O. de Lopez was his lawful wife at the time ■of his death, and after the death of said Benito Lopez made application to the honorable Probate Court of Wilson County to be appointed administratrix of the community estate of herself and her said deceased husband.
“3. That subsequently, to-wit, on the 15th day of January, A. D. 1889, said Karolina 0. de Lopez, as principal, with the other above named ■defendants as sureties, executed and delivered to the county judge of Wilson County, Texas, her bond as said administratrix, conditioned as required by law, and that said bond was duly approved by said county judge on the 16tli day of January, A. D. 1889.
“ 4. That said Karolina O. de Lopez also returned and filed in said Probate Court on the 6th day of October, A. D. 1888, an inventory, appraisement, and list of claims of said estate, which were duly approved by said county judge on the 6th day of October, A. D. 1888, thereby investing said Karolina O. de Lopez with the right to control, manage, and dispose of the community estate of herself and her said husband as she pleased, being responsible on her said bond for any mismanagement of said estate.
“ 5. That the said Karolina Lopez had executed another bond, with N. de las Santos as one of the sureties, before the filing of said inventory and appraisement, at whose request, made to the County Court, she was ■compelled to file a new bond, which she did, with the sureties aforesaid.
“ 6. That the said Benito Lopez and Karolina O. de Lopez possessed at the time of the death of said Benito Lopez a large amount of community property, which said Karolina Lopez took possession and control of ■as said administratrix upon her qualification as aforesaid.
“ 7. That said community estate consisted of personal and real property of great value, to-wit, $13,085.85, and of a large amount of good and collectible claims due said estate, to-wit, of the value of $4719.72, all of which appears by the inventory, appraisement, and list of claims returned into said court and sworn to by said Karolina Lopez and the appraisers of said estate, to-wit, Antonio Flores, N. de la Zerda, and W. A. Scott.
“ 8. That the indebtedness of said estate is far less than the assets, to-wit, the sum of $8500.
“9. That Benito Lopez was indebted to plaintiffs at the time of his, said Lopez’s, death, as follows, to-wit, on a promissory note signed by said Benito Lopez, payable to A. B. Frank & Co., at their office in San Antonio, Texas, for the sum of 8175.35, dated November 1, 1887, payable ninety days after date, with interest at 12 per cent from date and attorney fee of 10 per cent. That said note was credited with the sum of $100 January 24,1888, leaving a balance due plaintiffs on the 16tli day of October, 1888, of 887.35, which was allowed as a claim against said estate by said Karolina Lopez, and approved by said county judge for said sum of $87.35, and to bear interest at 12 per cent from October 16, 1888. That there is now due and owing on said claim to plaintiffs the sum of $102.20, which said note is filed in the papers of the said estate and is referred to and made a part hereof. Also, said Benito Lopez was indebted to plaintiffs for goods, wares, and merchandise sold and delivered to said Benito Lopez in his lifetime at divers dates on an account, on which there was due on the 21st dajr of August, A. D. 1888, the sum of $394.57. That said account was allowed as a claim against said estate-by said administratrix, and approved by the county judge of Wilson County for the said sum, and there is now due on said account the sum of $447.18. Said original itemized account is filed in the papers of said cause by defendant, and is hereby referred to and made a part hereof.
“ 10. That plaintiffs are the owners of said claims, and no part thereof has been paid.
“ 11. That more than one year has elapsed since the filing of said inventory, appraisement, and list of claims.
“ 12. That said administratrix has failed to faithfully and properly administer said estate, and has wasted and misapplied the assets and property of said estate; has sold valuable real estate at far less than its value, and has failed to diligently collect the claims due said estate, and has not paid any of the debts of said estate, and has squandered and misapplied the assets of said estate, sufficient in amount to pay plaintiffs’ and all other claims against said estate. And still there is property of said estate liable for plaintiffs’ debts, not disposed of.
“ Wherefore plaintiffs bring this suit and pray for citation as the law directs, and on a final hearing for judgment for their said claims, the amounts aforesaid, with interest due thereon, and for such other relief as in law and equity they may be entitled to.”
The demurrers are as follows:
“ Now come defendants in the above entitled cause, by their attorney, and say, that this court hath no jurisdiction to try this cause, because:
“1. Plaintiffs’ petition shows, that previous to the institution of this suit, they instituted in the Probate Court of Wilson County a suit upon the same cause of action against these defendants, and that said suit is still pending.
“2. Plaintiffs’ petition shows, that prior to the institution of this suit plaintiffs presented the claims herein sued on to the defendant K. O. de Lopez, as administratrix of the community estate of herself and Benito Lopez, deceased; that said claims were by said administratrix allowed; that said claims were afterward approved by the county judge; and that by virtue of such allowance and approval, said claims were merged into judgment of the said Probate Court of Wilson County against these defendants, and can not now be sued upon, there being no warrant of law for a second suit between the same parties on the same cause of action.
“3. Plaintiffs’ petition shows on its face, that all questions sought to be decided in this suit are res ad judicata in a court of competent jurisdiction.
“4. That plaintiffs having, as shown by their petition, voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the honorable Probate Court of Wilson County, said court being of competent jurisdiction, can not legally institute another suit between the same parties for the same cause of action in a court of this State of an entirely different jurisdiction, but must seek all their redress in the court first chosen.
“ 5. Plaintiffs’ petition shows, that there is an administration of the community estate of K. O. de Lopez and Benito López, deceased, and pending such administration no other court except the Probate Court of the county in which said administration is pending has jurisdiction to render a judgment on claims for money against said estate, in the absence of an allegation by the plaintiffs that said claims have been presented to and rejected by the administratrix, and no such allegation appears.
“ Wherefore defendants say, that this court hath no jurisdiction over either persons of defendants or the subject matter of this suit, and they pray judgment of the court dismissing them with their costs.
“ Should defendants, however, be held to further answer, then they demur to plaintiffs’ petition, and say the same is not sufficient in law or equity to hold these defendants to answer; and for special exceptions to said petition defendants say:
“1. Said petition fails to show that the claims sued on were ever rejected by the defendant K. 0. de Lopez as administratrix.
“2. Said petition shows that there is another suit pending in this State between the same parties for the same cause of action.
“3. Said petition does not set out the items of the account sued on.
“ 4. Said petition does not allege to what class the claims sued on belong.
“ 5. Said petition does not allege and show that all claims against said estate entitled by law to priority of payment have been paid, or that there is property of said estate subject to execution sufficient to satisfy not only the claims sued on but as well those entitled to priority of payment.
“ 6. There is no allegation in plaintiffs’ petition of any finding by the Probate Court of Wilson County, Texas, of such facts as would authorize this action.
“ 7. The allegations of the petition show, that plaintiffs are creditors of the community estate of K. 0. and Benito Lopez, and there is no warrant of law for suit by them against the defendant K. O. de Lopez and her sureties, without first having sought the judgment of the Probate Court as to whether the facts would authorize such suit.”
We believe the petition states a cause of action. The petition does not meet the test ordinarily required in stating a cause of action upon a promissory note and open account. It does not allege that Benito Lopez became bound by reason of the execution and delivery of the note; nor does it set out the items constituting the account or give a bill of particulars of the amounts and items, but refers to an account filed in the papers in the case, showing the several items thereof. The same degree of certainty is required in stating a cause of action against appellee as the representative of the Lopez estate, in seeking to establish a debt against it, or in seeking to make appellees liable for the payment of the claim, as would exist in seeking a recovery against Lopez if he was alive and a party to the suit. But the want of allegations in the respects noticed is cured by the averments of the petition which charge that the appellees allowed and approved the claims sued upon. We know of no law that requires the survivor of the community estate when so administered to allow and approve a claim, nor does the law require such action by the county judge as in other administrations, and the effect of the allegations that the claims were allowed by the appellee, the survivor of the community estate, and approved by the county judge, would not have the effect of merging said claims into a judgment, as would be the effect in a regular administration under the statute; but the effect of such allegations would be, if true, that appellee admits liability upon the note and account sued upon. It is similar to a cause of action based upon an account stated. The fact that the amount has been admitted or agreed upon, relieves the plaintiff from the necessity of proving the items constituting the basis of his claim.
The petition does not state to what class the plaintiffs’ claim belongs. The law requires that the survivor of the community, when administering the estate, shall pay claims in the order in which they are classed, and a demurrer questions the petition for its failure to so state. This allegation was not required to be made under the facts as pleaded.
It appears from the averments that the survivor of the community received assets of the estate largely in excess of the debts of the estate, and that she has misapplied and squandered property of the estate in value much more than all of the debts due by it. The petition seeks to recover of her and her sureties on her bond the amount of debts sued upon; alleging that the waste and misapplication of the property of the estate creates a breach of the bond. The fact that the administratrix has violated the terms of the bond by squandering and wasting property of the estate in value far in excess of all the debts due by it, renders it unnecessary to state to what class the claim belongs, as such facts show the appellees are liable for the claims sued upon as well as all other debts due from the estate.
It does not appear from the record what was the principal reason why the court below held the petition defective and why it sustained all of the demurrers; but from the manner in which the case is presented here, we are inclined to believe that the court below sustained the demurrers upon the ground that the County Court had no jurisdiction to render the judgment asked, and that if the plaintiffs had a remedy, it was on the probate side of the docket, as given by articles 2176, 2177, and 2178 of Sayles’ Civil Statutes.
The petition charges a devastavit and appropriation of the assets of the estate by the administratrix of the community, and a failure to pay the claims sued upon, and her and sureties’ consequent liability therefor. We are of opinion that these facts authorize a remedy by suit against her and the sureties on her bond in any court that has general jurisdiction of the amount involved in the suit.
We do not believe that the remedy provided by article 2176 of Sayles’ Civil Statutes was intended to be exclusive, but was simply intended as a remedy cumulative of others that exist by virtue of the jurisdiction conferred upon the courts. Such is evidently the construction placed upon the law by the case of Huppman v. Schmidt, 65 Texas, 585, although the controversy there was between distributees of the estate and the survivor administering the community estate and his bondsmen.
There is nothing in article 2176 that expressly confines the creditor to the remedy there given. It simply provides a method of ascertaining the condition of the estate and if the facts exist that authorize the creditor to sue. The survivor when administering the community estate is free from the control of the Probate Court, and acquires over the property of the estate the same right of management, control, and disposition possessed by a managing partner during the life of the partnership. How the trust shall be administered, the law does not direct. Leatherwood v. Arnold, 66 Texas, 416.
The bond required of the survivor administering the estate is for the protection of creditors and others interested in the estate. And when its conditions and terms are violated to the injury of the creditor, he has the right to go into any court that has jurisdiction of the amount, as is provided for other litigants, and determine his rights there, and is entitled to all the rights and privileges granted other litigants. The facts that he has a claim against the estate and that it is unpaid, and that circumstances have arisen that make the survivor of the community and her sureties liable for its payment, are facts that can only properly be adjudicated in a court that has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit; and in ascertaining if these facts are true, it is a valuable privilege that the parties have in having them passed upon by the verdict of a jury. This they can not do if the jurisdiction of the Probate Court is exclusive as given by articles 2176, 2177, and 2178 of Sayles’ Civil Statutes.
Without extending the argument further, we hold that the County Court had jurisdiction, and that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer. Judgment reversed and cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered January 25, 1893."
219208,S. D. Killough v. C. H. Lee,1893-02-02,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
This was a suit for specific performance, brought by appellant upon the following instrument:
“Galveston, February 24, 1890.
“Received from Dr. D. S. Killough §50 for an option to buy within six days from 12 o’clock Monday, February 25, A. D. 1890, the northeast and southeast blocks of outlot number 85, city of Galveston, Texas, and improvements thereon, except lot number 85; and it is further agreed and understood, that a one-sixth interest in the within named property is owned by a minor son of C. H. Lee, and the sale of his interest is contingent upon authority from the court. The price agreed upon is §12,000 cash, upon payment of which the said Charles H. Lee will make deed for his five-sixths interest, and make application to court for the sale of interest of his minor son. This option closes and expires by limitation at 12 o’clock, March 2, A. D. 1890, being six days from this date.
[Signed] “C. H. Lee,
“By J. W. Riddell, Agent.
“Accepted.
[Signed] “ D. S. Killough.”
The petition alleged, that within the six days allowed in which appellant could buy the property, he notified the agent of appellee that he would take it, and offered to deposit with the agent such an amount as might be required of him to bind the purchase; that the agent declined to accept any less sum than §12,000, stipulated in the agreement as the price of the land; that it was the custom of Galveston, on purchase of real estate, for the purchaser to deposit a reasonable amount of money with the seller as earnest of his good faith and intention to carry out the contract of purchase, to be held by the seller pending the examination of the title. It appeared from the petition that the purchase money of the land was neither paid nor tendered within the six days. Exceptions to the petition were sustained and the cause was dismissed by the court below.
The only question which is presented for our determination is whether or not the failure of appellant to pay the price stipulated for the land before the time fixed when the option should expire put an end to his rights under the agreement.
Appellant contends that his notice to appellee’s agent that he would take the land upon the terms proposed was an exercise of his option, and that he thereby acquired the right to pay for and acquire the land within such reasonable time thereafter as was necessary to enable him to satisfy himself as to the title, and that the payment of the price within the six days was not by the contract made essential.
We can not assent to this view of the transaction. The option which appellant had was to buy within six days. Therefore whatever was requisite in order to buy, was by the express terms of the writing required to be done within that time, and was therefore essential to invest appellant with the right to a conveyance of the land. Consequently, unless it can be said that notice to the agent of his acceptance of the proposed trade constituted a purchase of the property by appellant, he must fail. In our opinion this conclusion is forbidden by the terms of the contract, which prescribes in what manner appellant may buy the land, viz., by the payment of $12,000 cash. The word “buy” in the writing means not simply an acceptance of the offer, but a purchase, completed by payment.
It is true that in ordinary contracts for the sale of lands on a credit the time fixed for payment is not ordinarily deemed by courts of equity to be of the essence of the contract, so as to defeat specific performance after the expiration thereof; and there is always a strong inclination to relieve defaulting vendees from forfeiture of their right to have their purchase enforced, especially where interest may be considered adequate satisfaction to the vendor for the delay. The reasons by which courts are guided in their decisions upon questions of that character have very little, if any, force in the determination of cases like this. Even in them, payment at the time stipulated may be made essential by the contract of the parties or the circumstances of the case. Edwards v. Atkinson, 14 Texas, 373.
In cases of options, there is some conflict of authority as to the essentiality of the time of payment. The principles applicable are thus stated: “Where the contract is really an offer on one side, with a proviso that this offer must be assented to and accepted when a mere acceptance is contemplated, or payment must be made when payment was the act of acceptance contemplated, at or before a specified date, then of course the net of assent or of payment must be done within the prescribed time; and time is from the very form of the contract essential. If, therefore, a vendor agrees to convey if payment be made at or before a given date, or if an option is given which is to be accepted by payment within a given time, then the time of payment is certainly essential; in fact, payment is a condition precedent to the vesting of any right in the vendee. If, however, the offer or option given requires assent and acceptance within a given time, such assent must be made within the time prescribed, and the contract thereby becomes concluded and mutual; but whether time is essential with respect to subsequent performance must depend upon"" its object or the nature of its subject matter.” Pome, on Con., sec. 387.
The contract under consideration required not simply that appellant should assent to the terms proposed within the six days, and pay the price at some subsequent time, but that he should buy within that time, paying the price in cash. Thus payment was made essential by the agree•menl of the parties, which the court can not disregard without infringing upon their right to shape their own contracts as they deem best.
The judgment is therefore affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered February 2, 1893."
219130,H. S. Smith and Wife v. Joseph Tripis,1893-02-02,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
Tripis brought this suit to recover for a balance alleged to be due by the defendants to him as commissions for the sale effected by him of land which was the separate property of the wife.
Defendants demurred to the petition, because it did not show,that there was any such contract to pay commissions as would bind Mrs. Smith. They also defended, and denied their liability, because in effecting the sale plaintiff had fraudulently acted also as the agent of J. B. Rosborough and J. M. Rosborough, the purchasers of the land, and was himself interested in the purchase.
Mrs. Smith pleaded in reconvention for the sum of $1000 already paid to plaintiff by her husband out of the proceeds of said land, which was her separate estate. She alleged fully the want of authority on the part of her husband to make the contract with plaintiff to pay him such commissions; and averred that if any trade or contract was ever made between the plaintiff and her said husband, it was without her knowledge or consent, and was made in fraud of her rights. She denied that she had ever consummated the trade as alleged by plaintiff, or that she had ever recognized the plaintiff as her agent in the sale of the land, or that she had ever paid or agreed to pay plaintiff any sum of money for his pretended services. She alleged, that said sum of $1000 was paid out of her separate funds by her husband, without her knowledge or consent, and in utter disregard of and in fraud of her rights; and that the payment was made through the false and fraudulent representations of the plaintiff, and through the ignorance and mistake of her said husband, and that the money was wrongfully and illcgalty received by the plaintiff; wherefore she prayed judgment for the recovery of the money, with interest.
As shown by a bill of exceptions, the plaintiff made a verbal motion Ur strike out the plea in reconvention, which was sustained, and an exception was taken.
On presentation of the demurrer to the petition, that it did not show a cause of action against Mrs. Smith, the demurrer was sustained, and Mrs. Smith was dismissed from the suit and judgment was rendered in her favor on the cause of action set up by the plaintiff.
On trial by the court, the plaintiff recovered judgment against the defendant S. H. Smith for the amount sued for. Both defendants have appealed.
The court should not have entertained an oral demurrer to Mrs. Smith’s plea in reconvention. The plea also showed a good cause of action in Mrs. Smith for the recovery of the $1000 already paid by the defendant S. II. Smith to the plaintiff, and the court erred in dismissing the same.
The petition itself failed to allege sufficient facts to show the liability of Mrs. Smith for the commissions claimed by the plaintiff. Her plea in reconvention alleged that she was not liable; that she never ratified the sale, nor in any manner bound herself to pay the money that was paid; and that the same was paid in fraud of her rights and without her consent or knowledge. The facts set out in the plea are fully sufficient, if true, to authorize a recovery by Mrs. Smith from Tripis of the money already paid to him.
It appeared from the evidence, that sometime in December, 1890, Smith requested Tripis to sell the land, and fixed the minimum price at $4 per acre. The land was an undivided one-fourth interest in 36,000 acres in Aransas County, and belonged to Mrs. Smith in her separate right. Smith agreed with Tripis to pay him a commission of 5 per cent. Sometime after this, Tripis was in San Antonio, where he met J. M. Rosborough, who inquired of him if he knew of any good investments in lands down in his country, stating that his uncle, J. B. Rosborough, of Salt Lake, had some surplus money that he wanted to invest. Tripis told him of the land, and that it could be had at $4 an acre; and after he returned to Rockport he entered into a correspondence with J. M. Rosborough on the subject. 1-Ie told Smith he thought he had found a purchaser.
The Rosboroughs went to Rockport and wanted to see Smith, but Tripis kept them apart, representing that it would result in breaking up the trade if they met, and that if anything could be effected in reducing the price of the land he could do it better than any one else, and pretended to go and see Smith The Rosboroughs supposed that he was their agent in effecting the trade for the land, and although they paid him no commission for making the purchase, they agreed to let him into the purchase as an equal partner, and J. B. Rosborough advanced him the money to pay his proportion of the first payment of $5000.
Smith and wife signed a contract by which they agreed to convey the land to the Rosboroughs and Tripis, the latter representing to Smith that the Rosboroughs would not take the land unless Tripis was admitted as an equal partner in the purchase. J. B. Rosborough gave a draft for the $5000 cash payment, and when the draft was collected two or three weeks afterwards, Smith paid Tripis out of the proceeds $1000, and Tripis asked him to say nothing to the Rosboroughs about having paid him a commission. In making the sale and purchase Tripis was acting for himself and in his own interest.
Without further statement of the facts, we think that the admitted facts in the case show that Tripis placed himself in hostility to the interests of his principal. The price $4 was given by Smith to Tripis as a minimum price, and it was the duty of Tripis to get as much for the land as possible. When he became interested in the purchase he put himself in hostility to the interests of his principal.
J. D. Rosborough testified, that Tripis was interested with them from the start; that they wanted him to take a less interest, but he insisted that-the land was cheap, and he wanted to buy, and would be valuable to them in colonizing the land. The facts show that Tripis was not entitled to recover, because he became interested adversely to his principal Smith. Although Smith knew that Tripis was interested as a purchaser with the Rosboroughs when he and his wife signed the contract of sale, he was not in possession of all the facts showing the adverse interest of Tripis. The finding of the court that Tripis acted in good faith with Smith is not sustained by the evidence. The objection to evidence on account of variance may be avoided on another trial.
The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded for another trial.
Reversed and remanded. ■

219170,Texas & New Orleans Railway Company v. Georgia Brown et al.,1893-02-09,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
This suit was brought by the widow and children of S. M. Brown, deceased, to recover damages for injuries resulting in the death of said Brown, alleged to have been caused by the gross negligence of the servants of defendant in the operation of a switch engine on defendant’s railway, and over a public crossing, in the town of Orange.
Defendant pleaded contributory negligence on the part of the deceased. The accident occurred March 29, 1887. As the law stood then, the defendant was only liable for the ‘ ‘ unfitness, gross negligence, or carelessness” of its servants. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 2899, and note.
Defendant requested the court to charge the jury, that the evidence was insufficient to establish gross negligence on the part of the defendant, its agents, servants, or employes, and to find a verdict for the defendant. The refusal of the court to give this instruction has been assigned as error. There is evidence tending to show that the switch engine was being run across the public street at the rate of about fifteen miles an hour, and that no warning of its approach was given by the ringing of the bell on the engine or the blowing of the whistle. It was admitted that there was an ordinance prohibiting the running of trains in the town of Orange faster than six miles an hour; and there was evidence that the blowing of the whistle was also prohibited by ordinance. From all the evidence in the case the jury might have found that there was gross negligence on the part of the engineer and fireman in the running of the switch engine that struck .and hurt the deceased, and the charge was correctly refused. But the question of contributory negligence, the fact of which is also raised by proper assignments of error, does not depend upon the freedom of defendant’s servants from negligence. If the want of due care on the part of the deceased was the proximate cause of the injuries which resulted in his death, then the plaintiffs can not recover, although the defendant’s servants may have been guilty of negligence. Railway v. Peay, 20 S. W. Rep., 57.
The evidence shows that just before the accident the engine had passed over the crossing, going east on the main track, and was returning, going west on the switch. Deceased had started on the usual way to his home, along a plank sidewalk over a marsh. Some of the witnesses testified that he was on the sidewalk, where it was a part of the public crossing, but others place him below the crossing. Some say that his side was to the engine, and others that his back was to it. All of the evidence conclusively shows that deceased stepped upon the track just in front of the engine, where there was nothing to obstruct the view. He said to his son, who ran up to him within two minutes after he was hurt, “ I was on the railway and did not know it was coming back until it struck and killed me.” There is a conflict of evidence as to how far the engine was from the deceased when he stepped upon the track. It varies from fifty feet to two or three feet, as stated by the engineer, Middleton. It would seem from the testimony of some of the witnesses that he was walking alongside of the track, when he stepped upon it, and from others that he approached and went directly on it. It is not made clear just how deceased approached the track, but it is not shown that he exercised any care or precaution whatever. Several school children were passing on their way home to dinner, and the hat of one of them had fallen in the marsh, and deceased in his direction to the child about recovering the hat, seemingly failed to notice the approach of the engine, and was struck.
The accident was a deplorable one, and but for the absorption of the deceased in the recovery of the child’s hat, we have no doubt would not have occurred. He was shown to be a man of most exemplary habits and usually careful. One of the witnesses said that he-had frequently warned the children of the danger at the crossing. But from the evidence we can not escape the conclusion that the accident was contributed to by the want of due care on the part of the deceased in going upon the track of the defendant in front of the approaching engine. It was a public crossing, and deceased, if on the crossing, was not a trespasser upon the track; but he was bound to the exercise of care in the use of the crossing, and the evidence showing that the accident was contributed to 'by negligence of deceased in going upon the track, when by the use of ordinary care he could have discovered the. engine and avoided the accident, plaintiffs ought not to recover.
There are several assignments of error upon the charge of the court. We think that the charge is in the main a very correct one; but the latter part of the eighteenth paragraph is, as contended, inapplicable to the facts. The paragraph is as follows: “It was the duty of Dr. Brown, when he entered upon or onto defendant’s switch, to have used his senses of hearing and sight; and if he failed to do so, even though defendant should by you be found to be guilty of gross negligence, still his heirs can not recover, as such failure to so use his senses would be in law contributory negligence, unless you should find the motion of defendant’s engine was so rapid as to render the exercise of his senses by him useless, and of no avail to avert injury.” Such a charge was calculated to mislead the jury. The deceased would not be excused from the exercise of care in going upon the track because the engine was running at a rapid rate.
The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered February 9, 1893."
219229,Lamb & Wynne v. Beaumont Temperance Hall Company,1893-02-16,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellee, claiming to be a corporation, sued appellants on the 13th day of August, 1891, in trespass to try title, to recover the possession of a house and lot in the town of Beaumont, and also to recover $280 rents for its use. Plaintiff based its demand for rents upon an alleged contract by which appellants, on the 12th day of May, 1883, rented the property at the rate of $10 per month, alleging that the lease had expired, and that appellants were wrongfully withholding the premises. A writ of sequestration was sued out and served, and defendants replevied.
Appellants filed a number of exceptions to the petition, and answered by general denial, plea under oath denying the incorporation of plaintiff, and a plea of the statute of limitations.
Plaintiff filed supplemental petition, alleging that defendants had acknowledged tenancy under it, and were estopped from denying its title; that defendants had, in writing signed by them, acknowledged the debt due under the contract for rents, on the 21st day of July, 1891; setting out more fully the terms of the rental contract, and showing that the defendants’ right to the possession under it ceased on the 31st day of July, 1891, and that the use of the property thereafter was worth $25 per month; that defendants had wrongfully withheld the possession and had replevied the property. Judgment was prayed for rents at the rate of $10 per month until the 1st of August, 1891, and thereafter at the rate of $25 per month against defendants, and also against the sureties on the replevy bond for rents accruing after it was given until the trial.
Defendants excepted also to this pleading, denied its allegations, and pleaded that if they had acknowledged tenancy to plaintiff, they had been induced to do so by the fraudulent and false representations of plaintiff that it was the owner of the property, when in fact it was not. An exception filed by plaintiff to this last plea was sustained. All of the defendants’ exceptions to the plaintiff’s pleadings were overruled.
When the case was called for trial, defendants made application for continuance for the testimony of a witness residing in McLennan County, Texas, stating that they were surprised by new matters alleged in the supplemental petition (which was filed on the day of trial) requiring additional evidence to meet them; that the testimony of the witness was material to the defense; that they had a meritorious defense, which could be shown by her; and that they had taken no steps to procure her evidence, because it was not expected she would be needed. The applicacation was overruled, and a trial was had, resulting in judgment in favor of plaintiff for the property sued for, and for the sum of $324.26 against defendants, and against the sureties on the replevy bond for $91.26 of the first amount.
From this judgment defendants appealed, without moving for a new trial in the court below.
The first and second assignments of error, that the petition showed no cause of action, and that the District Court had not jurisdiction of the case stated, are not well taken. An action of trespass to try title can be maintained to recover the possession and rents of real property, from a. tenant holding over after the expiration of his term. Thurber & Co. v. Conners, 57 Texas, 96. Had the original petition stood alone, some of the exceptions taken to it and presented in the third assignment, might have been good; especially that which points out its failure to show when the rental contract was by its terms to expire.
The allegations necessary to meet the exceptions were, however, made in the supplemental petition. They should have been supplied by amendment of the original petition. No exception was taken based on this irregularity, and any objection which might have been made to this disregard of the rules may be treated as waived. Taking the original and supplemental petitions together, they meet the exceptions. '
The point made in the fourth assignment, which asserts that a sequestration can not issue against a tenant holding over, is involved in the ruling on the first and second assignments. A sequestration may issue in any case where a party sues for the title or possession of real property. Eev. Stats., art. 4489.
The fifth assignment complains of the ruling sustaining exceptions to defendants’ plea setting up false representations by plaintiff as to title. There was no error in the ruling. It was not alleged that defendants had been deprived of the enjoyment of the property by any adverse claimant, and the question of title was wholly immaterial.
The sixth assignment calls in question the regularity of the proceedings by which appellee claims to have been incorporated. By entering into the rental contract, and contracting an indebtedness with appellee as such, appellants estopped themselves to deny that appellee was a corporation in this suit for recovery of such possession and rents. Rev. Stats,, art. 599.
In their seventh assignment of error appellants claim that the court rendered judgment for a greater sum than was warranted by the pleadings and by evidence. As to the first point, the supplemental petition claimed all that was awarded by the judgment.
The second point might be disposed of by saying that it was not presented by motion for new trial in the court below. We have, however, examined the evidence and find that it amply supports the judgment. Indeed, there was no controversy in the trial about the indebtedness of defendants.
The eighth assignment complains of a ruling which is not shown by the record. The findings of fact and of law are not before us. The motion for continuance was plainly insufficient. It pointed out no part of the pleadings which surprised defendants. The only fact stated in the supplemental petition which could not have been anticipated from the pleadings as they before stood, was the alleged acknowledgment of the debt, set up in reply to the plea of the statute of limitations. That was not especially pointed out by the application, and the court could not see from the application what allegation defendants regarded as introducing new matter. Besides, the acknowledgment became immaterial. If we reject all rents which would be barred without it, the evidence still shows an indebtedness quite as large as was found by the judgment. The sum due appellee was admitted by appellants upon the express condition that it be deducted from the rents barred by limitation. As appellants had not pleaded any setoff nor offered evidence of any, they were in no attitude to exact its allowance as a matter of right, and can not have it deducted from the part of the debt unbarred.
The judgment is affirmed.

219164,A. D. Moores & Wife v. John Linney et al.,1893-02-16,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
This case turns upon the sufficiency of the certificate of acknowledgment to a power of attorney, which appears to have been executed by Isabella Moores and her husband, A. D. Moores, to one John R. Peterson, authorizing him to make conveyance of the land in controversy, which was the separate property of Mrs. Moores by inheritance from her father and mother, James and Susan Philips. The certificate is as follows:
“ The State of Texas, Nueces County.—Before me, Cornelius Cahill, a justice of the peace and ex officio notary public in and for said county, personally came Albert D. Moores, to me well known, and to me acknowledged that he executed the foregoing instrument of writing, dated October 25, 1877, and that he signed, sealed, and delivered the same for the purposes and considerations therein stated.' Also personally came Mrs. Isabella Moores, wife of the said Albert D. Moores, parties to the foregoing power of attorney or.instrument of writing, dated the day and year above written, who having been examined by me privily and apart from her said husband, and the said instrument having been fully to her, acknowledged the same to be her own act and deed, and that she willingly signed, sealed, and delivered the same for the purposes, uses, and considerations therein stated, and that she wished not to retract.
11 In testimony whereof, I hereunto sign my name and affix my notarial seal, this October 25, 1877.
[Seal] “ C. Cahill,
“Justice of the Peace and Ex Officio Notary Public.”
The objections urged to the certificate are:
1. It does not appear that Mrs. Isabella Moores was known to the officer who took the acknowledgment to be the person who executed the instrument.
2. It does not appear from the certificate of the notary that the contents of the instrument were fully explained to the said Isabella Moores.
3. It does not appear from the certificate that Mrs. Moores stated to the officer that she wished not to retract said instrument.
We are of the opinion that the certificate of acknowledgment was fatally defective on account of the omission of the word “ explained ” in the certificate of the officer. McKie v. Anderson, 78 Texas, 210; Huff v. Webb, 64 Texas, 284.
The third objection is not well taken. About the first we express no opinion.
Defendants in their answer set up the payment of the purchase money by them and the receipt thereof by Mrs. Moores, and prayed that she be compelled to return it, with interest, before she should be allowed to recover the land. An exception to this portion of the answer was overruled; and the court admitted testimony, over the objections of appellants, that Peterson, the attorney in fact, received the sum of §2434.50 as the purchase money of the land in controversy, and paid the same to the heirs of James Philips, deceased; and that A. D. Moores received for his wife from Peterson §350 on account of all lands sold by him in Refugio and Goliad Counties.
Neither the allegations in the answer nor the proof admitted by the court presented any defense to a recovery of the land by Mrs. Moores.
The case was tried below without a jury, and it appears from the evidence that the interest of Mrs. Moores in the land is seven-twenty-fourths, and that its rental value is 5 cents per acre.
Judgment of the court below will be reversed as to the appellants and here rendered in favor of Mrs. Moores for an undivided interest in seven-twenty-fourths of the land in controversy, and all costs except her proportional share of costs of partition; and that the cause be remanded for partition and setting apart to Mrs. Moores of the seven-twenty-fourths of said land here decreed to her; and the District Court will ascertain and adjust the rents and improvements in accordance with the statute.
Reversed, and reformed, and remanded for partition.

Justice Pleasants did not sit in this case."
219266,W. H. Whitcomb et al. v. The State of Texas,1893-02-16,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
This action was brought in the name of the State of Texas on a liquor dealer’s bond, for a breach of the condition of the bond that the dealer would keep a quiet house.
The petition set out the bond, which is dated March 12, 1891. The following are the only allegations of the breach of the bond: “ That notwithstanding the bond and obligation of the said Whitcomb and his sureties as aforesaid, heretofore, to-wit, on the — day of -, 1891, in violation of his said obligation to the State, the said W. M. Whitcomb did not keep a quiet and orderly house or place of business for the sale of malt liquors capable of producing intoxication, and did allow therein music, loud and boisterous talking, and the use of indecent and vulgar language, and did allow large crowds of negro men and women to assemble in and near his house and place of business, all of which was in violation of his said bond to the State as aforesaid; whereby the defendants have become liable,” etc.
The petition also alleged that the bond was executed for the purpose of enabling the defendant Whitcomb to procure a retail license to sell malt liquors capable of producing intoxication, in the county of Anderson, State of Texas, and that he did procure said license on the 12th day of March, 1891.
Trial was had to a jury, and verdict and judgment were returned and rendered for the State. Defendants filed motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial, which were overruled by the court.
From the statement of the facts in the record, we make the following conclusions:
1. Defendant Whitcomb executed the bond set out in the petition, with the other defendants as sureties, and obtained a license as alleged.
2. Defendant conducted his business of retail dealer of malt liquors in a house in the city of Palestine, Anderson County. In the front part of the house he sold groceries, and in the back part of it had a bar for the sale of beer. Just in the rear of defendant’s store house, and across an alley about twelve feet wide, there was an arbor arranged with tables, at which persons sometimes sat and drank beer, which was sold in the house and drunk in the arbor. A door opened from the side of the house next to the arbor. Defendant Whitcomb had control of the arbor. It was shown that during May, 1891, music was played some three or four times in the arbor. A witness also testified, that there was during the same month loud and boisterous talk and vulgar and indecent language in the house. This, however, Whitcomb denied.
1. There was no error in overruling the motion in arrest of judgment. While the petition was subject to special exception, it would have been good on general demurrer. Maier v. The State, ante, p. 296.
2. The court charged the jury as follows: “ The words house or place of business would include not only the house or room in which the liquor was kept for sale, but any arbor or structure kept by defendant for the purpose of the business of selling liquors. It would not include any other house or structure, however, not kept by defendant and not used for the purpose of such business. It would not, if such other structure was so kept and used for purposes of the business, be necessary that the liquor should be actually sold therein. Therefore, if you find from the evidence that in defendant’s place of business, as just explained, music, loud and boisterous talking, yelling, or indecent or vulgar language was allowed, used, or practiced, you will find for the plaintiff the sum of $500.”
It is contended, that this charge is erroneous, because “ on the weight of evidence, in so far as it defined a place of business, and in effect instructed the jury, that defendant Whitcomb’s house or place of business included the arbor near by, though no liquors of any kind were ever sold in said arbor; and instead of so instructing the jury, the court should have submitted an issue of fact whether said arbor was or not defendant’s place of business.” The charge left it to the jury to say whether or not the arbor was kept by the defendant for the purpose of the business of selling liquors, with the instruction, that it would not be necessary that the liquor should be actually sold therein. This was a correct enunciation of the law, and the charge is adapted to the facts proved on the trial. It is immaterial whether the beer was sold at the bar or in the arbor.
3. Proof that the defendant sold beer in the back part of his store, when it was shown that he had obtained a license for the sale of malt liquors in quantities less than a quart, was sufficient to support the verdict and judgment, if it should be shown that he did not keep a quiet house. It will be presumed, in the absence of other evidence, that the beer was sold lawfully in accordance with the license, and the court will judicially know that beer is a malt liquor. Maier v. The State, ante, p. 296.
It was shown by the evidence, that defendant kept a store, in the front part of which he sold groceries, and in the back part sold beer, which was drunk in the arbor. The jury could very correctly find that Whit-comb kept a house or place for the sale of malt liquors in quantities less than a quart, and that the arbor was a part of his place of business. The verdict is fully supported by the evidence, and there being no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.

Justice Williams did not sit in this case."
219116,"S. M. Swenson v. J. C. McLaren, Tax Collector",1893-02-07,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On the 1st day of January, 1889, appellant was the owner of 22,893 acres of land situated in Stonewall County, which, through his agents, Thomson & Donnan, he rendered to the assessor for taxation at the rate of 81 per acre. This rendition was made out at Austin, and forwarded to the assessor by mail, who, upon receipt of same, notified appellant’s said agents that this valuation was too low, and would be referred by him to the board of equalization. On the 27th of June the board of equalization of Stonewall County raised the valuation of this land from $1 to $3.50 per acre. Prior to this, on the 27th of May, 1889, the Commissioners Court of said county met as a board of equalization and ordered the clerk to give, ten days notice of the sitting of the board, and the clerk, in obedience to said order, in person posted one notice at the court house door of Stonewall County, but did not post such notices in each justice’s precinct in said county. Said, clerk also mailed to Thomson & Donnan a written notice that the board of equalization desired to raise the valuation of said land so rendered by them for appellant, but he did not issue notices in the name of the State of Texas, directed to the sheriff or any constable of Travis County, Texas, or any other constable or sheriff of the State, citing Thomson & Donnan to appear before the said board to show cause why the rendition of S. M. Swenson’s property should not be raised, as it is contended is required by article 1531, 1 Sayles’ Civil Statutes. The board raised the valuation-above set forth without hearing any evidence as to the value of the land, but acted upon their own knowledge in fixing its value.
On the 13th day of February, 1889, the Commissioners Court of Stonewall County, assuming to act under article 3731, Sayles’ Civil Statutes, divided said county into a convenient number of school districts, and thereafter a petition, in form in compliance with the law, was presented to the Commissioners Court of said county praying for an election to beheld in district number 1 to determine whether or not a tax of 20 cents on the $100 should be levied for school purposes. To said petition was signed thirty-two names. In compliance with this petition, said court ordered an election as prayed for therein, to be held on April 20, 1889, which is in words as follows:
“ It is ordered by the court, that the application for an election on school tax in district number 1 be accepted and approved, and that an election be held' on the 20th day of April, A. D. 1889, for the purpose of voting 20 cents on the $100 for such purposes; and that B. C. Wray be appointed manager in election precinct number 1, at Rayner, and that J.. S. Orr be appointed manager in precinct number 2, at J. S. Orr’s, in school district number 1.”
No order was entered by the Commissioners Court directing the sheriff to give notice of such election, as required by article 3733, but on March 19, 1889, the county judge of Stonewall County issued the following notice:
“school election notice.
‘ ‘ The State of Texas, County of Stonewall.—To all whom this may concern : Notice is hereby given that there will be held an election on Saturday, the 20th day of April, 1889, in school district number 1, at Eayner, Texas, and at the residence of J. S. Or in said county. The polls in said district will be opened at 10 o’clock on said day for the purpose of determining whether or not there shall be levied an annual tax of two-tenths (two mills) cents on the dollar for school purposes, as provided for by the acte of the special session of the Eighteenth Legislature of the State.
[Seal County Court, Stonewall County.]
[Signed] “ F. C. Cook, County Judge.”
On the back of one of these notices was endorsed the following:
“ Came to hand March 19, 1889, and executed by posting and causing to be posted one copy of the within notice at the court house door, and one copy at two other places in said district. This 21st day of March, 1889.
[Signed] “J. C. McLaren, Sheriff.”
It does not appear what the result of this election was, but the Commissioners Court levied the tax as indicated in the order, and as no question is raised in the briefs as to this defect in the statement of facts, it will be assumed that the result of the election was in favor of making the levy.
Appellant tendered the amount of taxes due from him upon his valuation in court, and sought to enjoin appellee, as tax collector, from collecting the remainder of the taxes complained of in his petition. This tender, however, did not include the 20 cents school tax in precinct number 1.
The court below refused the injunction as prayed for, and from this judgment this appeal is prosecuted.
By the third paragraph of the Act of March 22, 1879 (1 Sayles* Civil Statutes, article 1517a), it is provided, that “the board of equalization shall have power to correct any errors in the assessment of property at any time before the tax is paid on said property;” and in Duck v. Peeler, 74 Texas, 268, it is held, that until a tax payer has exhausted the legal remedy thus given, the courts should refuse him the equitable remedy by injunction, .and in that opinion it is said: “ This is a broad statute, and covers errors in valuation as well as all others.” And again: “The petition failing to show that appellee had been denied this plain remedy, existing when this suit was brought, or that for some reason it was inadequate,, was fatally defective and should have been so held.”
Appellant in his petition fails to allege that he had applied to the Commissioners Court to correct the alleged irregularity and over valuation complained of by him, and we are of opinion that if it be conceded that the proceedings of the board of equalization were irregular, and that the proper notice was not given appellant or his agents, yet appellant was provided by this statute with an adequate legal remedy to correct such errors, and if he failed to avail himself thereof, the injunction prayed for by him was correctly denied.
If, however, the proceedings of the board were regular and the notice sufficient, then the action of the board was final, and appellant’s petition-showed that he was without remedy, and the injunction for this reason-was correctly denied in so far as it was sought on account of the alleged irregular assessment of his property. Duck v. Peeler, supra.
Appellant contends, that after the first Monday in October, 1884, none of the Commissioners Courts had the power to divide their counties into ' school districts. The part of article 3731, Sayles’ Civil Statutes, relied upon to sustain this contention is as follows: “ It shall be the duty of the County Commissioners Courts of all counties not exempted from this section to subdivide their respective counties into school districts at least one month before the first Monday in October, 1884.”
In Sutherland on Statutory Construction, section 448, it is said: “ Provisions regulating the duties of public officers and specifying the time for their performance, are in that regard generally directory. Though a statute directs a thing to be done at a particular time, it does not necessarily follow that it may not be done afterwards. In other words, as the cases universally hold, a statute specifying a time within which a public officer is to perform a final act regarding the rights and duties of others is directory, unless the nature of the act to be performed, or the phraseology of the statute is such that the designation of time must be considered as a limitation of the power of the officer.” And again, in section 450: “ The assessors of a school district were directed by statute to assess the district tax within thirty days after the clerk had certified the vote for raising the tax, and it was held to be merely directory, as there were no negative words in the statute limiting their power to make the assessment afterwards.” Such we believe to be the general rule (Flatan v. The State, 56 Texas, 93), and we see nothing in this statute which requires a different construction to be placed upon it. We find no negative words in this provision; and in view of the fact that at the time of its passage many of the counties in this State were unorganized, and could not comply therewith within the time named, it would be unreasonable to hold that such counties were intended to be deprived of all benefit to be derived from our district school system. We are of opinion that the action of the Commissioners Court in subdividing Stonewall County into"" school districts in 1889 was legal.
Appellant also complains of the tax of 20 cents on the $100, levied in school district number 1, as being irregular and illegal, because the sheriff, was not ordered by the court to give notice of the election at which said tax was voted, and did not give such notice in the manner required by law. .From the findings of fact it will be seen, that while the sheriff posted up these notices, they were not signed by him, but were signed by the county judge, and there was nothing upon the face of the notices from which an elector could infer that either the sheriff or the Commissioners Court had anything to do with summoning him to vote at this election. Upon its face the notice appeared to be only the act of the county judge.
Mr. Cooley, in his work on Taxation, section 335, in speaking of these special elections to vote taxes, says: “All special meetings must be regularly called as the statute may have prescribed, for no one is under obligation to pay heed to any but the legal notice, and those who come together in pursuance of any other do not, for legal purposes, represent the electors. The following are customary regulations: That the meeting shall be called by the officers of the municipality, either on their own motion or on the application of a certain number of the voters or freeholders; that it shall be notified either by a warning delivered or its contents stated to the several voters, or by notice published or posted in a manner particularly indicated by the statute; and that the subjects to be considered at the meeting shall be specified in the warning or notice. With all these provisions there must be careful compliance, and the meeting when held must confine itself strictly to the subjects indicated in the notice or warning.” To sustain this a great number of cases are cited, in a number of which it is held, that a school district tax voted at a meeting not legally called is void. To the same effect is 2 Desty on Taxation, 1126 to 1133; also, see Reynolds Land and Cattle Company v. McCabe, 72 Texas, 57.
We are therefore of opinion that the irregularities attending the ordering and giving of the notice of this election as above indicated renders the tax voted thereat illegal and void. It will be noted one of the provisions of the statute requires, that “the Commissioners Court shall order the sheriff to give notice of such election by posting three notices in the district for three weeks before the election, and the sheriff shall obey such order,” and no authority is given the county judge to give such notice, and we are of opinion that the tax payers were not called upon to assemble at his call.
Appellant upon the trial below also attacked the election in this precinct, on the ground that twenty of the signers to the petition for this election were not qualified property holding tax paying voters of said district, and to prove this offered in evidence the last assessment roll of Stonewall County. If it be conceded that this could be inquired into after it had been passed upon by the Commissioners Court in ordering the election (which we do not decide; see City of Fort Worth v. Davis, 57 Texas, 225, and Dwyer v. Hackworth, 57 Texas, 245), we are nevertheless of the opinion that the action of the court was correct. If it be desired to show that a certain instrument does not appear of record in a county, it has been held, that the proper practice is to have the custodian of the record make a careful examination, and then prove by him as a witness this fact (Edwards v. Barwise, 69 Texas, 84); and we believe the same rule should apply where it is sought to prove that a name does not appear upon the tax rolls. It would seem to be impracticable to have the entire tax roll introduced in evidence, and the jury required to search through it to see if the name appears thereon.
For the error above indicated, let the judgment rendered by the, court below be reversed and here rendered, perpetuating the injunction as to the tax of 20 cents on the §100, levied for school purposes in district number 1, and dissolved as to all other taxes sought to be enjoined in the petition; appellee to pay the costs in this court and in the court below.
Reversed and rendered.

219131,Cordella A. H. Baker v. John Millman,1893-02-07,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This case was decided by the court without a jury, upon an agreed statement of facts. According to this agreed statement, in July, 1886, Grimes County sold and conveyed to Buffington, McDaniel, and Baker her four leagues of school land, and thereafter said Buffington, McDaniel, and Baker conveyed the same to appellant. The Commissioners Court of Grimes County duly advertised said land for sale, and accepted the bid of the aforesaid parties at $2.45' per acre on twenty years time, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, payable annually in advance, beginning September 1, 1886; and at the July Term, 1886, of the Commissioners Court duly confirmed said sale. These lands were located as the school lands of said county in the-year 1852, and patented in the year 1877. The 160 acres tract of land in controversy is a part of the four leagues of school land.
It was admitted that D. G. Ash was in possession of said 160 acres as an actual settler at the time said land was sold by Grimes County, it having been surveyed for him at the time of his settlement; and that he-was a married man and had no lands elsewhere, and had made improvements on said lands, consisting of a dug-out and cow lot; and that in December, 1886, he sold the land to appellee, having made a verbal contract for the sale thereof a few days prior to the sale of Grimes County, but no money was paid for his claim until December, 1886. It was admitted that appellee was a single man, without any other land, and that he had never lived on the land in controversy. The improvements were valued at $370. It was also admitted that Ash made a tender to Grimes County, and to Buffington, McDaniel, and Baker, in accordance with the terms upon which they purchased the lands, in the manner stated in the case of Baker v. Borroughs, ante, page .337, and that this tender was made as soon as Ash knew of the sale. It also appears that appellee deposited in court money and notes in accordance with the terms of the purchase from Grimes County, claiming the preference right secured by Ash and conveyed to him.
The questions of law arising upon the state of facts indicated above seem to us to have been already passed upon by our Supreme Court. Article 7, section 6, of the Constitution, in reference to the sale of school lands of the counties, provides, that “Actual settlers residing on said land shall be protected in their prior right of purchasing the same to the extent of their settlement,” etc. The words “actual settlers” as here used have received a literal construction. Baker v. Millman, 77 Texas, 46. We conclude, therefore, in view of the agreed statement, that Ash was in possession as an actual settler at the time the land was sold by Grimes County; that he secured the preference right to purchase guaranteed by the Constitution; and as he and his assignee both took the proper steps to make this right available, appellant acquired title to the four leagues subject to this right.
We are of opinion, that the mere fact that Ash had verbally agreed to transfer his right to appellee before the land was sold did not prevent him from being an “ actual settler.” As no further settlement or residence on the land was required, we are of opinion that when his prior right to purchase was secured by actual settlement, and a tender in compliance with the terms of purchase prescribed and accepted by Grimes County, he could lawfully assign all his right and interest to appellee, who would be entitled to assert this right without himself settling upon the land. That this provision of the Constitution applied to future settlers, as well as those who were residing on the land when it was adopted, has been expressly decided in the case of Baker v. Dunning, 77 Texas, 28.
These conclusions dispose of all the propositions of appellant submitted under the first assignment of errors. The remaining assignment of error submits the proposition, that the order of the Commissioners Court approving the sale under which appellant claims is a judgment in rem, and therefore incapable of being impeached in a collateral proceeding. It seems to us that this proceeding of the Commissioners Court should be regarded rather as an act of agency in the sale of land than the exercise of a judicial function.
It follows from these conclusions that the judgment must be affirmed.
Affirmed.

219245,F. E. Dycus v. L. W. Hart et al.,1893-02-07,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This suit was instituted in the District Court of Archer County, by F. E. Dycus as plaintiff, against L. W. Hart as defendant. Subsequently Mrs. E. A. Hart, wife of L. W. Hart, made herself a party defendant. The plaintiff sought to recover 369 acres of land out of the Michael Fanning survey, lying in Archer County. The plaintiff’s claim arose out of a conveyance executed by George Finnin and Mark Lavery, alleged to be heirs of Michael Fanning, in whose name or to whose heirs the original certificate and patent issued. It was proved that George Finnin and Mark Lavery were the heirs of Michael Finnin, and it was also contended by plaintiff, that Michael Fanning and Michael Finnin was the same person. This question of identity was submitted to the jury and was solved against the plaintiff.
It appears from a bill of exceptions, that the defendant L. W. Hart, in March, 1886, purchased the land in controversy from George E. Finnin, a son of the George Finnin under whom appellant claimed by deed previ-' ously executed. By means of this conveyance from George E. Finnin to appellee Hart, the plaintiff sought to place defendants in the attitude of claimants under a common source of title. Defendants, evidently and naturally solicitous to sever themselves from this embarrassing connection, and preferring to occupy the position of naked trespassers, filed a plea disclaiming all title in the land through George Finnin, or George E. Finnin, and giving notice that they would not rely upon any interest of George Finnin, or George E. Finnin, or Mark Lavery,' or “any of the Finnin family.” This disclaimer was sustained by the court, and the plaintiff was forbidden to use the deed referred to for the purpose of showing that the parties deraign title from a common source. In this we think the court erred. In the case of Burns v. Goff, 79 Texas, 236, our Supreme Court holds, that a defendant “may not defeat the rule of common source by a declaration that he does not claim under it.” If, as a matter of fact, the defendants deraign their title from the heirs of Michael Finnin, they thereby admit the validity of that title, and they will not be permitted to defeat it by showing an outstanding title in the heirs of Michael Fanning with which they are not in any way connected. Glover v. Thomas, 75 Texas, 506.
Plaintiff’s title is derived through a deed from one John L. Scott to plaintiff, executed in May, 1889. John L. Scott claimed under a deed to himself by the heirs of Michael Finnin, dated March 6, 1855. In 1871 John L. Scott conveyed the land in question to his brother Levi Scott, a resident of another State. The deed recited the condition that Levi, would remove to Texas and settle upon the land. Levi, unwilling to abide by this condition, returned the deed to his brother; whereupon the latter erased the words expressing the condition and again sent it to Levi, by whom-it was held until February, 1889, when he again returned it to John L. Scott. This deed was never recorded. It does not appear whether or not it was destroyed. At the time of the sale to plaintiff by John L. Scott, in May, 1889, the latter remitted to his brother Levi $100 of the $300 paid by Dycus in consideration for the land.
Appellees contend, that even under the common source of title with which they are sought to be affected, there is an outstanding legal title in Levi Scott which will prevent a recovery by plaintiff. If, when Levi Scott returned the deed to his brother John L. Scott, in February, 1889,-it was the intention of the two that John L. Scott should be thereby reinvested with title to the land, we are of opinion that the former would be estopped from claiming the property. The existence of this estoppel, however, depends upon the existence of the intention specified; unless that intention existed, the surrender of a deed could not operate to divest the title out of Levi Scott and revest it in his brother. Dev. on Deeds, secs. 303-305; see, also, Lapowski v. Smith, 1 Texas Civ. App., 391. As we are not prepared to say that the evidence does not indicate this intention, we are unable to sustain this contention of appellees.
John L. Scott speaks of this deed as a quitclaim. The record, however, elsewhere describes it as a conveyance to the land, in consideration of $350 paid. Though the word “ quitclaim” is actually used, if the deed nevertheless purported to convey the land itself, and not the mere right or title of the grantor John L. Scott, and if the plaintiff paid the purchase money without notice of any claim by Levi Scott, he would be protected as an innocent purchaser against the unregistered deed of the latter. Richardson v. Levi, 67 Texas, 360. Under such circumstances, it could not be claimed that there was an outstanding legal title precluding the plaintiff from recovery. The court did not err in refusing the special charge requested by appellant, and which, we think, was upon the weight of evidence.
For the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.
Reversed and remanded.

219194,T. L. Marsalis and T. J. Sams v. J. A. Creager et al.,1893-02-16,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
Prior to October, 1881, Wilbarger County was unorganized, and constituted part of the Clay Land District. In October, 1881, said county organized and elected all its county officers, including a county surveyor, who qualified as required by law.
On the 28th of April, 1882, J. R. Nigh, county surveyor of Wilbarger County, received from the district surveyor of the Clay Land District a map of the surveys theretofore made in Wilbarger County, and a copy of Ml files, applications, and locations of lands in said county, all of which were filed in the surveyor’s office in Wilbarger County on the 29th of April, 1882. No survey of any of the boundary lines of Wilbarger County was made prior to 1883.
On March 5, 1883, the Commissioners Court of Wilbarger County ordered the county surveyor to survey and establish the south and west boundary lines of that county. Before making this survey, notice was given the County Court of Baylor County, but no notice was given the County Court of Hardeman County, nor does it appear from the record whether or not said last named county was organized at this time so that, such notice could be given.
In compliance with this order of the Commissioners Court of Wilbarger County, the surveyor of said county surveyed the south and west lines of same, and recorded the field notes thereof in the records of the surveyor’s office on the 14th day of May, 1883, and a copy of this work was returned to the General Land Office, but was not accepted by the Commissioner on account of defects therein, and nothing further was done towards establishing the boundary lines of said county, as required by the Act of April 22, 1879.
On the 29th of April, 1882, appellant T. J. Sams, being the owner of Confederate certificate number 1697, issued to W. T. Eidson, filed the same with the surveyor of Wilbarger County, accompanied by an application signed by his father, C. A. Sams, to survey the land in controversy thereunder. A survey upon this file was made by said surveyor,, and returned to the General Land Office July 26,1882, where it remained until August 4, 1882, when the Commissioner, without having placed his file mark upon it, returned the field notes to the surveyor of Wilbarger County, because of defects therein, and because there was no evidence on file in his office that Wilbarger County had organized as a separate land district. This survey was again returned to the Land Office by the surveyor of Wilbarger County on October 13, 1882, and on October 23,1882, the Commissioner again returned it to the surveyor on account of defects therein. On January 17, 1883, appellant Sams again returned this survey to the General Land Office, and on. February 26, 1883, the Commissioner returned it to him, because the survey was incorrect. The survey was again returned to the General Land Office July 12,1883, when it was marked “filed” by the Commissioner; but this filing was more than twelve months after the date of the survey, which was made May 5, 1882.
On November 25, 1882, appellee Creager, being the owner of Confederate certificate number 1419, issued to A. J. Williams, filed the same with the surveyor of Wilbarger County, accompanied with the proper application to survey the land in controversy; but before any survey was-made, he having been advised by the Commissioner of the General Land Office that Wilbarger County was not a separate land district, and was still attached to the Clay Land District for surveying purposes, withdrew said certificate from the office of the county surveyor of Wilbarger County, for the purpose of filing the same in the office of the surveyor of the Clay-Land District.
On the 17th of March, 1883, he filed said certificate with said last named surveyor, accompanied with the proper application to survey the land in controversy, and on the 29th of May, 1883, said surveyor made the survey, and the field notes were duly returned to the General Land Office July 14, 1883. The surveyor of Wilbarger County also assisted in making this survey, and recorded the field notes in his office. Upon this survey patent was issued to Creager on December 22, 1884.
On March 28, 1883, one J. K. P. Russéll, being the owner of Confederate certificate number 1341, issued to E. J. Logsdon, filed the same with the surveyor of Wilbarger County, accompanied with the proper application to survey the land in controversy; and a survey was made by said surveyor under this file June 29, 1833, and filed in the General Land Office October 18, 1883. Appellant Marsalis claims under this location. The record does not show affirmatively that this last named certificate was ever filed with the county surveyor of Wilbarger County; but from the fact that the survey was made and returned to the General Land Office, we conclude that it was properly accompanied with the certificate.
Because the boundary lines of Wilbarger County had never been established as required by the Act of April 22, 1879, the Commissioner of the General Land Office refused to recognize the surveys made by the surveyor of said county, and issued'the patent upon the survey made by the surveyor of the Clay Land District; and appellant Marsalis brought this suit in the court below as plaintiff, against appellant Sams and appellee Creager and others, to establish the priority of his claim by reason of the facts above set forth. Judgment was rendered in favor of appellees, from which this appeal is prosecuted both by the claimant under the Russell and the Sams locations.
It is contended by appellants, that section 10 of the Act of April 22, 1879, is unconstitutional, because said act embraces more than one subject, and the subject of this section is not expressed in the title thereto. The title of this act is as follows: “An act establishing and prescribing the manner of ascertaining the boundaries of counties.” Then follows a full and complete revision of our law upon the subject of establishing the boundary lines of counties, and the manner in which they shall be surveyed; and section 10 provides, that “Before any county in this State not already organized as a land district under existing law shall be recognized . as such, the County Court shall cause the boundary lines of the county to be surveyed and marked, and the field notes and map of such survey duly recorded and returned to the General Land Office as provided in this act.” It is not contended that this section of the law had been complied with at the time the surveyor of Wilbarger County made the surveys under which appellants claim; but it is contended that this section of the law is unconstitutional; and also, when construed in connection with section 1, the survey called for therein was not required to be made until it was ordered by the County Court or by the Commissioner of the General Land Office.
Without entering into an extended discussion of the question, we are of opinion that section 10 wras sufficiently embraced within the subject and title of the act, and is therefore constitutional. The reasons which lead us to this conclusion will be found discussed at length in the cases of Railway v. Smith, 54 Texas, 10; Stone v. Brown, 54 Texas, 341; Day Co. v. The State, 68 Texas, 542. The subject of this act is the establishing of the boundary lines of the different counties in the State, and we think the Legislature in the same act could well provide the consequences to be attached to a failure to comply with its provisions.
We are also of opinion, that section 1 of the act was intended to apply to eases xvhere the boundary lines of counties had never been established in compliance with its provisions, although they may have previously been organized as a separate land district; and section 10 was intended to require the boundary lines of all unorganized counties in future to be well defined under its provisions before being recognized as a separate land district.
It follows, therefore, from what we have said, that we are of opinion that the surveyor of Wilbarger County, at the time the surveys for both of the appellants were made, had no authority to make the same, and in such eases it has been held that his acts are void. Cox v. Railway, 68 Texas, 226. Article 3822, Sayles’ Civil Statutes, provides, that “Any unorganized county or newly created district which may fail or refuse to organize as a separate land district as provided by law, shall continue to form a part of the district to which it was formerly attached,” etc. From the findings of fact, it will be seen that Wilbarger County formerly belonged to the Clay Land District; and as appellee had his survey made by the surveyor of that district, the patent issued thereon constituted the superior right to the land.
A number of other interesting questions are presented by the record, but what we have said disposes of the entire case, and it will therefore be unnecessary for us to consider them.
Let the judgment of the court below be in all things affirmed.
Affirmed.

219124,William Gentry and S. C. Gentry v. Bowser & Lemmon,1893-02-23,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On the 4th day of May, 1888, appellees instituted this suit in the County Court of Dallas County, against appellants, William Gentry and S. C. Gentry, to recover upon a note for $271.66, and to foreclose a mortgage alleged to have been given by said Gentrys upon one Steadman engine, one Steadman boiler and fixtures, one Coleman corn mill, one Fairbanks scales, one Steadman steam press, and all belting, pulleys, shafting, and fixtures belonging to said machinery, to secure the payment of said note.
Appellants answered in a plea to the jurisdiction, alleging, that the machinery embraced in said mortgage at the time the same was given were fixtures constituting a part of the homestead of appellant William Gentry, who was a married man and the head of a family, and by reason of the fact alleged that the County Court had no jurisdiction to decree such foreclosure. They also pleaded the same facts in a special answer, and in addition thereto alleged, that appellees had sued out a writ of sequestration in this case, and had taken actual possession of said machinery and said appellant’s premises upon which the same were situated, and had deprived him of the use thereof; and that the use of said machinery and premises during the time he had been so deprived of the same was worth the sum of $550, for which amount he prayed judgment against appellees.
To this answer appellees interposed general and special exceptions. The special exceptions were, (1) that said answer did not allege of whom defendant’s family consists; (2) that the court had no jurisdiction ""to hear and determine the question as to defendant’s ownership of the land; (3) because said answer does not set out a specific account, in what defendant’s damages consisted, or the several items thereof; (4) because the said answer does not set out and define the defendant’s said homestead; (5) because the court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the subject matter set out in said answer.
From the judgment rendered by the court, it would seem that only the special exceptions were sustained; but from a bill of exceptions in the record we find that the general demurrer also was sustained, and appellants were not allowed to introduce evidence in support of their answer. We are of opinion that the action of the court was error. The answer does show that appellant William Gentry, at the time of the execution of the mortgage and at the time of the trial, had a wife and several children. It was certainly not necessary to give their names.
The plea to the jurisdiction of the court stated very clearly and succinctly, that at the time of the execution of the mortgage and at the time of the trial the machinery embraced in the mortgage was a fixture attached to the land; that the land consisted of 160 acres, upon which appellant William Gentry resided with his family, and that the mortgaged property therefore constituted a part of his homestead and of the land to which it was attached. We infer from the brief of appellants that because of these allegations the court below held that it had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the same. Had these allegations appeared in the petition instead of the answer, we hardly think the court would have attempted to foreclose this mortgage. Not appearing in the petition, it was proper for them to appear in the answer; and if the evidence supported these allegations, the court would clearly be without jurisdiction to grant the foreclosure. Certainly the court has the right to hear the necessary evidence to enable it to decide as to whether or not it has power to try the case it is sought to have it adjudicate, whether the allegations disclosing such want of jurisdiction appear in the petition of the plaintiff or in the plea to the jurisdiction by the defendant. The plea of the defendants clearly shows that the plaintiffs were seeking to have the County Court foreclose a mortgage upon real estate, and the court should have heard evidence upon this question, and if the plea was sustained should not have attempted to entertain jurisdiction of this part of the case. Appellees’ second and fifth special exceptions were therefore improperly sustained.
The damage claimed by appellants was for the use and rental value of the machinery and premises during the time it was alleged to have been taken from their possession by the writ of sequestration; and while upon this branch of the case their allegations are somewhat general, yet we deem them sufficient. No attempt was made to treat the acts of appellees as a conversion of the property, but a recovery was sought for its use only. This was proper. Willis & Bro. v. Morris, 66 Texas, 628. Appellees’ third special exception was therefore improperly sustained.
In describing his homestead, appellant William Gentry in his answer alleged, that “at the date of said mortgage and long prior thereto, he was, and is now, a married man and the head of a family consisting of a wife, then and now living, and six minor children, then and now living with him; that with his said family he occupied and used as a homestead and farm to support his said family a tract of land of 160 acres in Fannin County, Texas, cultivating the same as a farm, and having his dwelling house thereon, in which he lives with his said family, and a gin house and cotton gin and corn mill thereon. That the Coleman corn mill, Steadman steam press, Fairbanks scales, with the shafting, pulleys, and fixtures thereto attached, and being the same described in plaintiffs’ petition and mortgage attached thereto, and on which a lien is so sought to be foreclosed, were permanently attached as fixtures to said 160 acres of land, and are a part thereof, and to said cotton gin, corn mill, and gin house at the date of said mortgage, and long prior thereto and are now, so attached.” We do not perceive what better description could be asked, and we are therefore of opinion that appellants’ fourth special exception was improperly sustained. That such machinery as this, if attached to a country homestead by the owner as alleged in this answer, would become a part thereof and not subject to mortgage after it was so attached, we think clear. Railway v. Winter, 44 Texas, 597; Hutchins v. Masterson, 46 Texas, 551; Harkey v. Cain, 69 Texas, 146; Willis & Bros. v. Morris, supra.
We are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial in accordance herewith, and it is so ordered.

219073,"A. L. Rhomberg v. J. C. McLaren, Tax Collector",1893-02-23,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
This suit was brought to enjoin the collection of a school tax levied in Stonewall County. There was a trial •before the court below without a j ury, upon an agreed statement of facts. The assignments of error raise questions of law only.
In August, 1887, while Stonewall County was an unorganized county and attached to Jones County for judicial purposes, an election was held in the territory covered by Stonewall County, by which a school tax of 12£ cents on the §100 worth of property was voted, in pursuance of the orders of the Commissioners Court of Jones County, declaring said entire territory to be one school district, and providing for an election therein to determine whether said tax should be levied. The election was duly held, the result declared, and the tax levied by the Commissioners Court of Jones County.
Thereafter, on the 28tli day of December, 1888, Stonewall County was duly organized, and in February following the Commissioners Court of the newly organized county created two school districts out of its territory, and defined their limits and boundaries, without first obtaining the will of the majority of the voters of said districts.
In March, 1889, said Commissioners Court ordered an election in school district number 1, at which a tax of 20 cents on the 8100 worth of property was voted; whereupon the Commissioners Court declared the result of the election, and levied the tax which appellant by this suit sought to enjoin. This election was ordered upon the petition of more than twenty qualified property holding tax paying voters of said district; but the names of less than twenty of them, to-wit, nineteen only, appeared upon the last assessment roll of the county.
1. The first contention of appellant is, that the court erred in holding that Jones County had no authority to create the unorganized county of Stonewall a school district and order an election therein for the purpose of voting a school tax. The Constitution, article 7, section 3, authorizes the Legislature to provide for the formation of school districts within all or any of the counties of this State.
In pursuance of the provision of the Constitution, article 3731 of the Revised Statutes makes it the duty of the County Commissioners Court of all counties not exempted from that section of the Revised Statutes to subdivide their respective counties into convenient school districts.
Article 9, section 1, of the Constitution, provides, that territory exterior to existing counties may be divided into counties in advance of population, and attached for judicial and land surveying purposes to the most convenient organized county or counties. Section 12 of this article provides, that lands lying in and owned by nonresidents of unorganized counties shall be assessed and taxes thereon collected at the office of the Comptroller. Stonewall County never was any part of the territory of Jones County.
Our conclusion is, that the Commissioners Court of Jones County had no authority under the Constitution and-laws of this State to declare the unorganized county of Stonewall a school district, and that the proceedings which resulted in the levy of the 12-J- cents school tax by the commissioners of Jones County were void. Appellant’s second contention, that there was error in holding that the organization of Stonewall County made void the election previously held under the order of the Commissioners Court of Jones County, is therefore rendered immaterial, and must be denied.
2. The issue raised by the third assignment of error is, that though the petition for the election ordered by the Commissioners Court of Stonewall County may have been signed by twenty or more qualified property holding tax paying voters residing in the district, the election was nevertheless void, because less than twenty of these names were shown by the last assessment roll of the county. Article 3733 of the Revised Statutes, which provides for ordering such an election upon the petition of twenty or more qualified property holding tax paying voters, does not require that their names should appear upon the assessment rolls. Article 3733b, however, which states the qualification of the voters at the election and not of the petitioners for the election, declares, that all persons who are legally qualified voters of the State and county of their residence, and who are resident property tax payers in said district, as shown by the last assessment roll of the county, shall be entitled to vote, etc. The Constitution, article 7, section 3, prescribes the same qualifications, without the phrase “ as shown by the last assessment roll of the county.” This phrase is also omitted in the next succeeding article of the statute, which prescribes the proof to be made of the requisite qualification by a party whose vote has been challenged. We conclude, that the statute has not made the assessment roll the exclusive evidence of the qualification of the petitioners, and that the petition in this case was a sufficient predicate for ordering the election.
3. The fourth assignment reads as follows: “ The court erred in his finding of law, wherein he finds that the levy of school taxes in precinct number 1 is valid.” Several propositions are submitted under this assignment, all of which are disposed of by the preceding conclusions. It is therefore not necessary that we should decline to consider these propositions on account of the very general character of the assignment.
4. The fifth and last assignment asserts the invalidity of the tax, be- , ■cause the assessor failed to provide a separate tax roll for said school district, as required in article 3733h, but entered the same on the margin of the general State and county rolls. The authority relied on is the case of Folkerts v. Power, 42 Michigan, 283. That case arose under statutes materially different from our own. The school tax was required to be placed on the “city roll.” A separate tax warrant was required to be issued for the collection of the tax on the city roll, and the time of its collection differed from that of collecting taxes on the general State and county roll, upon which the school tax in that case was placed. Our statute, article 3733k, provides, that the tax assessor shall assess and the collector shall collect said district school taxes as other taxes. No tax warrant is required. While it is made the duty of the tax assessor to make a separate roll for each school district, we are of the opinion that the failure to provide such a roll is not fatal to the validity of the tax. We are of opinion that the action of the assessor in extending the school tax in a separate column upon the general State and county tax rolls, on the margin of which it was shown to what school district the tax belonged, though defective, was sufficient to warrant the collection of the tax. At all events, it is held in this State, that a court of equity will not on this ground alone enjoin the collection of the tax. Harrison v. Vines, 46 Texas, 15; George v. Dean, 47 Texas, 84.
It follows from these' conclusions that the judgment must be in all things affirmed.

219220,N. C. Hilburn v. E. R. Harris et al.,1893-02-23,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
Sometime prior to 1843, Dr. G. W. Long died in this State, and administration was had upon his estate in Fort Bend County. At the time of his death, Dr. Long left surviving him his wife and six whole brothers and sisters and four half-brothers and sisters, but no children. He left a considerable estate, consisting of land and personal property, among which was his own headlight certificate for 1280 acres of land. One of his sisters of the whole blood was Mary Williams, wife of Duke Williams; one of his brothers of the whole blood was. Ed. M. Long; three of his brothers of the half-blood were N. T., W. H., and J. J. Macon. Prior to the partition herein referred to, the four last named conveyed all their interest to Duke Williams, husband of Long’s-sister Mary above named.
On June 1, 1853, one of the parties interested in the estate of Long filed a petition in the Probate Court of Fort Bend County for a partition of said estate, making Duke Williams, with several of the heirs, parties thereto, but did not join Mary Williams, Ed. M. Long, and the three Macons above named therein. The nonresident hems who were made parties were duly cited by publication.
On the 25th day of July, 1853, this original petition for partition was amended, making the heirs who had not been joined as above set forth parties to such proceeding, and dismissing as to Duke Williams. It appears from this amendment that these new parties were nonresidents of this State.
At the July Term, 1853, a decree was entered ordering the partition of this estate, but it does not appear from the record that all the parties had been regularly cited to answer plain tiff’s petition other than by a general recital in the judgment.
At the August Term, 1853, the commissioners appointed by the above judgment made their report, which was confirmed; and by the partition so made, the 1280 acres certificate above referred to was given to Mary Williams, Edward M. Long, and the three Macons above named, so that by the terms of the decree, in connection with the transfers to Duke Williams above recited, the whole of this certificate became vested in Duke Williams and his wife, Mary. The land in controversy was after-wards located under contract with Duke Williams by virtue of this certificate:
In 1864 or 1865 Duke Williams died, leaving his wife, Mary Williams, and five sons and daughters surviving him. Appellees claim the interests of two of these children, and appellant the remainder; and the court below rendered judgment upon this basis in favor of appellees, from which this appeal is prosecuted. Appellant claims under deed made by Mary Williams, the surviving wife, to J. J. Williams and M. F. Kennedy, the last named being husband of one of the daughters.
Appellant’s first assignment of error attacks the validity of the decree of partition above referred to, upon the ground that it affirmatively appears from the record that Mary Williams, Ed. M. Long, and the three Macons were nonresidents of this State, and had never been properly served with citation; but we are of opinion that inasmuch as this decree constitutes the common source of title of appellant and appellees, that its validity is not material in this case. Had appellant proposed to show that his interest would have been greater by disregarding this decree than by upholding it, he would not be precluded from so doing; but inasmuch as his interest, as well as appellees’, in the land in controversy would be reduced by going back of the decree, we think he should be held to the common source. Burns v. Goff, 79 Texas, 236. It would therefore seem that appellant’s and appellees’ interest is the same, whether the decree be held valid or whether it be only held as evidence of a common source of title; and if this was the only cause of complaint the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.
Appellant, however, after the rendition of the judgment in the Cvurt below, made a motion for a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence, which was overruled, and this action of the court is assigned as error. By this newly discovered evidence it is proposed to prove, that in their lifetime Duke and Mary Williams entered into a verbal contract with their son J. J. Williams to give him this land, with other property, in consideration of his agreement to take care of them during the remainder of their lives; and that after the death of Duke Williams, Mary Williams, his surviving wife, made the deed to J. J. Williams and M. F. Kennedy above referred to in pursuance of this contract. It seems that Duke and Mary Williams during this time resided in the State of Tennessee, but the record does not show that the law of Tennessee in reference to community property is different from that in this State, and we must therefore presume it to be the same. Bradshaw v. Mayfield, 18 Texas, 21; Porcheler v. Bronson, 50 Texas, 555; Green v. Rugely, 23 Texas, 539; Abercrombie v. Stillman, 77 Texas, 592; Crosby v. Huston, 1 Texas, 203; James v. James, 81 Texas, 381; Brown on Jur., sec. 31.
Appellees contend that this motion should have been overruled, because it would tend only to show a verbal contract to convey land, which would be void under our statute of frauds; but we are of opinion, treating the Tennessee law to be the same as our own, the survivor of the community would have the right to convey the community property in satisfaction of an obligation of this kind. Brewer v. Wall, 23 Texas, 585; Primm v. Barton, 18 Texas, 206; Long v. Walker, 47 Texas, 173; Garnett v. Jobe, 70 Texas, 696.
Even if it be conceded that Duke and Mary Williams could not have been compelled to comply with their verbal contract to convey this land, it would seem that upon their refusal so to do, Duke Williams would be liable upon a quantum meruit for the value of the services rendered thereunder (Sprague v. Haines, 68 Texas, 216); and as this would be a community debt, the right of the survivor to convey community property in satisfaction thereof would seem to be clear.
We are therefore of opinion that this alleged newly discovered evidence was material; and if negligence is not to be imputed to appellant for his failure to discover it in time for the trial, his motion for a new trial should have been granted to enable him to produce it. The fact that such evidence can be produced, is shown by an affidavit made by M. F. Kennedy and a letter from Thomas Duke Williams, a son of Mary and Duke Williams, Sr.; and appellant’s attorney makes affidavit, that he had been diligent in looking up evidence in the case; that he had written a number of letters to Kennedy and to Thomas D. Williams, but did not learn of the. facts stated in his motion as above set forth until after the trial, and from these affidavits it would seem that he had been reasonably diligent in the premises.
In speaking of this question, Chief Justice Wheeler, in Mitchell v. Bass, 26 Texas, 377, says: “ Such motions are received with careful scrutiny, and are held to address themselves very much to the discretion of the court; and where the court has refused an application made upon this ground, the appellate court will not reverse, unless it shall appear that-the court below has not exercised its discretion according to the established rules of law. Yet, much as should be left to the discretion of the court, and reluctant as the appellate court may be to interfere with the exercise of that discretion, there are cases where the established rules of law and the principles of adjudged cases would be disregarded if a party was■ denied anew trial upon newly discovered evidence. The party who brings■ himself within the principles of such cases is entitled to a new trial as a matter of right, unless it be in those cases where it is apparent to the court. that the justice of the case has been attained. Where there can be any doubt of the justice of the verdict, to refuse a new trial, when the party has really discovered new evidence of a conclusive tendency, would be against justice and precedent; and by new evidence is meant proof of some new and material fact in the case, which has come to light since the trial.” And again: “ It is desirable that there should be an end of litigation with as little delay and expense as possible consistent with the great end of litigation—a correct decision of causes according to their real merits; but it should always be sought in subordination to the great end to be attained.” This language is quoted with approval in Wolf v. Mahan, 57 Texas, 175. See, also, Railway v. Forsyth, 49 Texas, 171, and Railway v. Barron, 78 Texas, 421.
Taking the affidavits in this case to be true, we are of opinion that they show reasonable diligence on the part of appellant and his attorney; and presuming the law of Tennessee to be the same as in this State, we think the evidence material, and that a new trial should have been granted.
Let the judgment of the court below be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial in accordance with this opinion.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered February 23, 1893."
219114,Llano County v. C. P. Scott,1893-02-01,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
Suit by C. P. Scott, the appellee, against Llano County, filed January 10, 1888, to recover damages alleged to have been occasioned by the establishment of a public road over his land by order of the Commissioners Court, made on the 17th day of February, 1887, pursuant to report of a jury of review appointed by a previous order.
The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $105 and costs, from which the county has appealed.
On the 14th of February, 1887, the Commissioners Court of Llano County, of its own motion, under authority of the first section of the Act of February, 1884, as stated in the order, passed an order appointing five freeholders, plaintiff one of them, as a jury of view to lay out a first class public road from the town of Llano, county seat of Llano County, to the line of San Saba County, in the direction of the town of San Saba, the county seat of San Saba County.
All the jury but plaintiff, on the 17th of February, 1887, made their report, showing survey of the road agreed on, running diagonally across plaintiff’s land on a line about 1100 varas in length. Plaintiff made a minority report, protesting against the establishing of the road as run, alleging that he would be greatly damaged thereby, and that the road could be established on his boundary line without making it more than a quarter of a mile longer, and none would be injured. On the same day the court adopted the majority report, and established it as a first class road. Plaintiff claimed no damages at this time, and no provision was made by the court for such purpose, but on the 10th of May, 1887, he applied to the court to appoint a jury to assess the damages, which he laid at $500, and on the same day the claim was rejected, and no damages allowed, “ for the reason that petitioner was one of the jury of view and did not file his account for damages as required by law.”
Nothing further was done in the Commissioners Court. Whereupon this suit was brought in the District Court, setting up the foregoing facts.
Defendant county excepted to the sufficiency of the petition, upon the ground that the injuries complained of and the assessment of damages were cognizable only by the Commissioners Court. Defendant also answered by general denial, except as to the allegation of laying out and establishing the road where alleged; and especially, that for seven years before the 17th of February, 1887, on that date, and up to the filing of the suit, the county had an old established road leading from the town of Llano to San Saba town, the general direction of the new road as laid out, and that the old road crossed plaintiff’s land at the same place where the new road was established, the jury adopting at such points the old road, making the bed of the old and the new substantially the same at the place indicated on plaintiff’s land. It is also set up in defense, that plaintiff was one of the jury of view locating the new road, a majority of whom laid out the road through plaintiff’s land; that he was present, and presented no claim to the jury of view for his damages for the appropriation of his land, and had made no such “ statement” to the Commissioners Court, and had taken no steps to bring the claim before that court for adjustment. It is also set up, “that for thirty years, and while the land over which the road runs was public domain, the public acquired and has since maintained over said roadbed through said tract of land a constant right of way, adequate in width, to-wit, 60 feet wide, to meet the public demands, and that the said roadway the whole of said time has been continuously and peaceably kept public for all purposes of a free and unobstructed passage, and that no part of said roadbed has ever been discontinued, nor has the easement in said passage' ever been in anywise diminished; that on and for more than three years prior to the 17th of February, 1887, Llano County has held in trust for the said travelling public 30 feet width of said roadbed, and styled said portion of said roadbed a second class road, and works the same as such; that in 1882, plaintiff’s vendor, Cr. W. Jernigan, acquired title to said land by pre-emption; that at the time said title was so acquired, and for a long time anterior thereto, to-wit, twenty years, the travelling public was holding and peaceably using said part of said roadbed as a public, free, and unobstructed highway, and that when plaintiff came into possession of the said 160 acres of land the travelling public had a vested easement of a public, free, and unobstructed passage over said road, adequate in width to meet the demands of the public, to-wit, 60 feet wide, and that plaintiff does now and has ever held the fee in said road in trust for the public use; wherefore defendant prays” for judgment, etc.
Defendant moved to strike out the several exhibits showing the orders and reports to the Commissioners Court, because ‘ ‘ the same are merely evidence in the ease.”
The court overruled the motion, and also the demurrers and exceptions to the petition.
There are a number of assignments of error, but only a few questions to be disposed of, which will be done without considering each assignment in its order.
Did the District Court have jurisdiction of the case, as presented ?
We think unquestionably it had. The County Commissioners Court declined to consider plaintiff’s claim for damages. The alleged cause for so doing was, that he was one of the jury that surveyed the road, and failed to present his claim to them, as required by article 4371, Sayles’ •Civil Statutes (amendment of same article in Revised Statutes), and that he so waived his right to damages, as declared in article 4372 of Sayles’ •Civil Statutes.
In the first place, we hold that there was no waiver. Before the failure to present the claim for damages would have the effect of a waiver* other parts of the law must be complied with. The jury are required (article 4370) to issue notice in writing to the land owners through whose lands a proposed road may run, or to agents, of the time when they will lay out the same, or when they will assess the damages incidental to the opening of the same, which notice shall be served upon the owner or agent at least five days before the day named. This notice is the initial step, the original writ, that invokes the jurisdiction of the jury and the Commissioners Court, and requires the land owner to appear and make claim for damages. If he does not appear after such notice and state his damages, he waives them, according to article 4372; but if he makes his claim, it is made the duty of the' jury to assess the damages and report the same with their report of survey to the Commissioners Court, which then estimates the damages—an adequate compensation for the land taken. We do not wish to be understood as holding that there could be a waiver under article 4372, under a regular proceeding. It is not necessary to decide the point in this case.
No notice was issued or served upon the plaintiff by the jury of. view.. This mode of estimating the damages and compensating plaintiff for the land taken was entirely ignored by the jury and the court. The statute does not require the jury to assess the damages at the same time they lay off the road; the notice may fix another time for this purpose. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 4370. But no notice of any kind was served upon plaintiff. In such case there could be no waiver. His presence as one of the jury could not bind him. The proceeding to assess the damages had not been instituted, and he was not bound to make the claim at the time. He protested against their running the road through the land, and made a minority report as one of the jury. After the court adopted the majority report and appropriated his land, he asked the court to appoint a jury to assess his damages. This was the mode of having the damage» assessed under the Revised Statutes (article 4371), referred to in article 4360a of the amended law, but article 4371 of the old law was amended only two days before article 4360a was added to the old law. It is not necessary that we should determine what act was referred to in article 4360a. Let it be admitted that it referred to article 4371 as amended two days before, it is still true that plaintiff had not been notified to appear before the forum authorized to assess his damages, and had waived no right to the same.
When he saw that his land was to be taken without compensation, he-applied to the Commissioners Court to have a jury appointed to assess his damages, and was denied a hearing. The court refused to consider his claim.
The District Court had jurisdiction, the amount claimed being within its jurisdiction. Had the proceeding authorized by the statute been set in motion as prescribed, and had the Commissioners Court acted upon the claim and adjusted the damages according to their discretion, the question would be different. He was not allowed the right to have his claim passed on by the Commissioners Court or the jury. His land was taken without his consent; the authorities of the county who might have organized á forum under the statute to try his right failed to do so, and now it is insisted that he can not resort to the regular courts of the country to have his rights determined, because they have no jurisdiction. The position is not sound. It has been held that where the Commissioners Court fails to comply with the law, the District Court has jurisdiction end can grant relief. Bounds v. Kirven, 63 Texas, 161.
It is said by appellant that plaintiff should have appealed from the action of the Commissioners Court. We do not decide that he could have appealed. It is sufficient that the court failed to comply with the law in taking his land without his consent and without compensation. This confers jurisdiction on the regular courts of the country.
Changing a road from a second class to a first class road necessarily requires more land from the owner, and it can only be done upon compensation.
The long use by the county of a second class road could not be applied to the first class road • 60 feet in width. There is no prescription in the case for a road of any class. Cunningham v. San Saba County, 1 Texas Civ. App., 480.
We are of opinion that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.

219240,"Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. Bertie Vancil",1893-02-08,"COLLARD, Associate Justice.
Suit by appellee, Bertie Vancil, against appellant, to recover damages for the value of the use of a trunk and contents (being wearing apparel, etc.) during the time the same was unreasonably delayed by defendant. The value of such use is laid at $250. Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $125. Defendant appealed.
The plaintiff, Bertie Vancil, a single lady, of age, resident of Gonzales County, Texas, intending to go to her brother, about sixteen miles from Ballinger, on a visit for several months (and to accompany a sister who was in feeble health), reached San Antonio, where, after remaining all night, on the morning of the 17th of January, 1889, she purchased a through passenger ticket to Ballinger, Texas, from a railway company which connected with defendant’s railroad at Temple, Texas, the route from Temple to Ballinger being over defendant’s road. She had her trunk checked through and received check for same, number 93. She arrived at Ballinger about 5 o’clock the next morning, had demand made for her trunk by virtue of the check, and again, on the 6th of February, made personal demand for it, and failed to- get it. She brought suit for it, after which it was found and restored to her at her brother’s-house, on the 15th day of February, by the company’s agent, who carried it to her.
The evidence shows that the check was lost from the trunk. The baggage master in the employ of defendant at Ballinger at the time the trunk should have arrived was discharged about the 19th or 20th of January, and left on the 21st, and carried the trunk with him, claiming it as his own. The company afterwards found it at Temple and had it conveyed to the plaintiff.
It was a large-sized zinc trunk, and contained plaintiff’s wearing apparel, and articles for personal use such as a lady would provide for herself for an absence from home on a visit of several months. During the time plaintiff was deprived of her trunk, she had no other clothes except what she had on and what she borrowed from friends. She says she suffered great inconvenience on account of it, and that the use of the clothes was worth to her $250 during the time. She valued the contents of the trunk at $500.
The court instructed the jury that the measure of damages was the value of the use of the property to the plaintiff during the delay in delivering it to her. There is no objection to the charge. It. is the law of the case. 3 Suth. on Dam., 294; Fairfax v. Railway, 73 N. Y., 167; 3 Willson’s C. C., sec. 391.
It is objected by the appellant, that plaintiff was permitted by the-court to state the amount of the value of the use of her property during1 the time she was deprived of it.
The testimony was admissible.. There was no market value of such property, and in such case opinions of witnesses familiar with the facts, together with the facts and conditions, are admissible, to be judged by the jury in estimating the damages. It would be difficult in cases like this to determine the value of use by a mere statement of the facts. The-opinion of a person having a knowledge of the facts would be some evidence, not an absolute guide—not binding upon the jury—but an assistance which would be available in the absence of more reliable proof. 1 Suth. on Dam., secs. 687, 802; 3 Suth. on Dam., sec. 294; Heligmann v. Rose, 81 Texas, 222.
The court below observed the proper rule in admitting the opinion of plaintiff. The jury did not adopt her opinion, but evidently considered it and all the other facts before them, as they should have done.
We are not in a position to hold that the verdict should be set aside because there was no evidence to support it, as insisted by appellant, or because it was excessive. It was the privilege of the jury to consider the nature of the loss, and the circumstances of the deprivation as it bore upon plaintiff at the time. She was not entitled to vindictive damages, but only to the value to her of the use at the time in her situation, and we can not say the jury have certainly exceeded the proper measure of such value.
Our opinion is, that the judgment should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.

Delivered February 8, 1893."
219185,Mary W. Murphy v. Oscar Reynaud et al.,1893-03-02,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Appellant sued appellees, in trespass to try title, to recover parts of certain lots in the city of Houston, which formed a strip of land 30 feet wide by 150 feet long. The petition contained the usual averments of title in plaintiff, and in addition alleged, that defendants claimed under a deed for the land to one Klein, purporting to have been signed by herself and her former husband, M. J. Massie, in September, 1871, and denied under oath that she had ever signed or in any manner executed such deed, and charged that her signature thereto was a forgery, and that she believed that of her husband was also a forgery. Defendants relied on pleas of not guilty, and limitations of three, five, and ten years.
It was shown at the trial, that the property at the date of the alleged deed to Klein was part of the homestead of appellant and her then husband, M. J. Massie. There was also evidence that it was the separate property of appellant by reason of its having been purchased with her means, though the deed was to her husband and put the legal title in him.
Defendants relied on the following title, besides limitation: Deed from plaintiff and her husband to C. W. Klein, September, 1871, recorded July, 1891; deed from Klein to W. S. Dugat and J. B. Likens, June 6, 1876, recorded June 10, 1876; deed from Dugat and Likens to appellee Reynaud, under whom the other appellees claim, of June 7, 1877, recorded September 18,1878.
The certificate of acknowledgment attached to the deed, purporting to be signed by Massie and wife, was in the usual form, except that it contained no statement that Mrs. Massie declared that she wished not to retract the deed, nor any equivalent words. The instrument in form was an absolute conveyance of the property in controversy, except that it recited payment of $200 of purchase money in cash, and retained a vendar’s lien to secure three notes for 850 each, given for the balance, the last note falling due December 1, 1871. Evidence was introduced by defendants, both direct and circumstantial, tending to prove the execution of the deed by both Massie and his wife. On the other hand, there was evidence in behalf of appellant that it was a forgery. When the instrument was offered in evidence by defendants, appellant objected to its admission because of the defective acknowledgment; and because it was an executory contract, and not sufficient to convey her separate property and defeat her homestead right; and because its execution had been denied under oath.
The court admitted the deed, ruling that by her affirmative allegations attacking it as a forgery, appellant had put her right to recover upon that ground, and should be confined to it; and in the charge given to the jury, the right of appellant was made to depend on the issue as to the genuineness of her signature to the deed. That question was submitted to the jury upon the evidence, as was also the question of limitation, and they found a general verdict for defendants, stating specially that the deed was genuine.
The evidence upon the issue of limitation showed conclusively, that appellees had held continuous possession of the land in controversy for more than twelve years prior to the institution of the suit, with an enclosure around it, using and enjoying it, openly and notoriously, as a part of the Reynaud homestead; that during all this time they have claimed and used it as their own, and in hostility to all others. The evidence in behalf of appellant on this issue does not raise any conflict which would authorize a jury to find in her favor. She testified on this point as follows: “ The strip of land in controversy in this suit was an alleyway, used by me before and after the death of my first husband in carrying wood and other things to the rear of our premises; myself and husband consented for Mr. Charles Klein to use said alleyway for like purposes in going to the rear of the premises. This alleyway was always a part of our homestead, and I never heard any one say that Mr. Massie had sold it. I never heard of it until I heard the deed above alluded to was filed for record. I allowed the defendants to use this alleyway, and never heard of their claiming a right to use it except by my consent until sometime about the year 1885. I returned from a visit, and found that defendants were erecting a house in front of this alleyway; I then had a fuss with them about it, but never could learn by what right they presumed to use it exclusively as their own.”
This is all the evidence by which appellant, on the question of limitation, seeks to avoid the force of the specific facts, testified to by witness after witness, including her own children, that a fence was put around the property soon after the date of the deed to Klein, thus including it within the enclosure around the property constituting the homestead of Klein and afterwards of Reynaud; that this fence was replaced, in 1882, by a new one which Reynaud built; and from 1879, at the latest, until the institution of suit, the possession by appellees was notorious and unbroken, and must from its very nature have been known to appellant. Her statements above copied are not sufficient to rebut or even weaken the evidence in support of the adverse possession, and could not sustain a finding in her behalf if the case were reversed. We must conclude, therefore, that appellees have had more than ten years peaceable and adverse possession, use, and enjoyment of the premises sued for. There is no proof of payment of taxes.
Our conclusions upon the law of the case are:
1. That the court did not err in admitting in evidence the instrument purporting to be a deed from Massie and wife to Klein. Its execution by Massie was sufficiently shown, and it was admissible as his deed for what it was worth.
2. But that deed was not sufficient to pass appellant’s title, the omission of the officer to state in his certificate of acknowledgment that Mrs. Massie declared that she wished not to retract the conveyance being fatal. Norton v. Davis, 83 Texas, 32.
3. We do not perceive that the petition restricts its denial to the fact that appellant had signed the deed. The statement is, that she had not signed nor in any manner executed it. The acknowledgment by a married woman is an essential part of her execution of a deed, and the language used in the pleading is broad enough to include a denial of such acknowledgment. Besides, we do not understand that this rule would be as the court below held it, even if the petition denied only the signing of the deed. The pleader is not there setting out specially his own title, but is attacking that of his adversary, by the allegation of a fact which he evidently supposed must be supported by affidavit, and therefore must be specially pleaded. This opinion may have been erroneous, but it is nevertheless true, that there is no purpose shown to restrict the issues to the question of the genuineness of the signature to the deed. The rule which confines a plaintiff in this action to proof of a title specially pleaded has no application. The charge of the court was therefore erroneous, wherein it confined plaintiff to the issue of forgery. The deed, even if genuine, was ineffectual to pass title to the homestead, and appellant would have been entitled to recover if defeated on no other ground. The special charges so declaring the law were true.
4. The fact that the deed retained a vendor’s lien did not bring it within the ruling in the case of Jones v. Goff, 63 Texas, 253. That case depended on a contract to convey at a future time. Here nothing was needed to complete title but the payment of the notes. There was no evidence that they had not been paid. None were produced, and it is evident, after this lapse of time, that if ever given, they had been paid. There was no error, therefore, in refusing appellant’s second special charge.
5. Nor should the court have given the special instructions numbers 1 and 5 asked by appellant, containing the proposition, that if appellant consented to the possession and use of the premises by defendants, they could not prescribe under the statutes of limitation. Consent of the owner of land to its occupancy by another does not of itself prevent such occupancy from being adverse, if the other essentials of an adverse holding appear. It is the absence of claim, or recognition of the true owner, on the part of the possessor, which prevents an occupancy which would otherwise be adverse from assuming that character. Such recognition does not necessarily result from an acquiescence in the use by the owner, but it is to be inferred from the conduct of the possessor.
6. It is unnecessary to decide whether or not the instruction given by the court and copied in the fourth assignment, as to the effect of abandonment of the homestead, was applicable to the case.
7. The evidence upon the issues of limitations was such as clearly entitled appellees to a verdict, and the result could not properly have been different had no error been committed. Appellant was barred by ten years limitation. The right judgment has been rendered, and the errors committed in the trial, inasmuch as the case must have been decided as it was, are immaterial.

219171,Western Union Telegraph Company v. V. E. Berdine,1893-03-09,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
The appellee instituted this suit in April, 1891, against appellant, for the recovery of compensation for alleged mental suffering inflicted, as averred by appellee, upon him by the appellant, through the failure of its servants to deliver promptly a message sent over appellant’s line of telegraph, on the night of the 11th of July, 1890, by appellee, from Thompson, in Fort Bend County, addressed to Dr. Fields, at Alvin, in Galveston County, requesting him to ■come by next train to appellee’s house at Thompson, to see a child of appellee’s, who was very sick.
The petition averred, that for four days previous to the 11th of July, 1890, the plaintiff’s child was sick, and on that day it grew worse, and plaintiff became anxious, and about 10 o’clock p. m. of that day he delivered to the operator at Thompson, the servant of defendant who was engaged in transmitting messages over defendant’s telegraphic lines between Thompson and Alvin, the following message:
“ Thompson, Texas, July 11, 1890.
“Dr. Fields, Alvin, Texas:
“ Come up next train; child very sick.
“ V. E. Beedine.”
That said message was delivered to said operator, to be by him transmitted over defendant’s line of telegraph to Alvin, and there delivered by defendant’s servants at Alvin to Dr. Fields. That plaintiff informed the operator at Thompson, to whom he delivered said message, of the illness of his child, and the purport of the message, and paid the operator his charge for transmitting same, to-wit, 25 cents. That Dr. Fields was a resident of Alvin; had resided there for a long time; that his residence was within 300 yards of defendant’s office in said town. That a daily train arrived at Thompson from Alvin, reaching Thompson about 8 o’clock a. m., the two towns being about twenty miles distant from each other. That defendant’s servants failed to transmit and deliver said message to Dr. Fields promptly, and willfully neglected to deliver the same until 12 o’clock m. of the 12th of July, 1890; that the doctor was at home in Alvin, and if the message had been promptly delivered to him by defendant’s servants, he might and would have come from Alvin to plaintiff’s residence, if not by an earlier train, by the morning train of the 12th of July, and would have reached plaintiff’s residence about 8 o’clock a. m. of that day; but that by the neglect of defendant’s servants to deliver said message promptly, the physician was unable to see plaintiff’s child until about 8 o’clock p. m. of the 12th of July. That the child had continued to grow worse, and was suffering from congestion when the physician arrived, and died on the following day about 8 p.m.; and that petitioner suffered great anguish of mind because of his inability to procure the attendance of a physician upon his dying child; and it prayed damages in the sum of 81999.99.
To this petition defendant filed general demurrer and general denial, and specially pleaded, that when plaintiff delivered the message to defendant’s servant at Thompson, said servant then informed plaintiff that the office at Alvin did not deliver messages at night, and that the message would not be delivered on the morning of the 12th in time for Doctor Fields to come to Thompson on the train arriving at that place from Alvin at 8 o’clock a. m., and that the doctor could not reach plaintiff’s house, if he came by rail, before the night of the 12th of July.
The case was called for trial on the 19th of October, 1891, and defendant moved the court to grant it a contiunance. The application for continuance was in substance as follows: “ Now comes the defendant in the above numbered and entitled cause, and moves the court to grant a continuance of this cause to the next term of this court for the want of the testimony of W. A. Cole, defendant’s agent at Thompson’s Switch at the time plaintiff filed the message about the delay in the delivery of which he brings this suit, and represents, that such testimony is material for the defense of defendant, and that said W. A. Cole is no longer in the employ of defendant, and that defendant has used every means, by telegraphing, writing, and otherwise, through and by its several agents, to ascertain the whereabouts of the said W. A. Ctile, but has been unable, though it has used all diligence to ascertain the residence of the said W. A. Cole, to do so, and in consequence has been unable to issue due process to obtain the testimony of the said witness; and that the testimony of the said W. A. Cole can not be obtained from any other source; wherefore defendant prays, that justice may be done, that this cause be continued to the next term of this court.”
This application was refused, and defendant excepted. Trial was had, and a verdict and judgment were rendered for the plaintiff in the precise sum prayed for in the petition. Motion for new trial overruled, and defant excepted and gave notice of appeal.
Four errors are assigned. The first is that of the refusal of the court to grant a continuance of the cause. The application shows that the defendant had not attempted to obtain the testimony through legal process, and it avers, as the reason for not having used the statutory means for obtaining the desired testimony, that the witness was not then in the employment of defendant, and that his residence was.unknown to defendant, although defendant had used er cry means by telegraphing and writing to ascertain the whereabouts of the witness. It needs neither citation of authorities nor argument to show that such an application is insufficient for the purpose of showing proper diligence by defendant to find the witness. The defendant was cited to answer plaintiff’s suit on the 23d of April, 1891, and its motion for a continuance was made on the 19th of October of the same year. But the application does not inform the court when the witness left the employment of defendant; when the inquiries as to his residence were made by defendant; nor to whom, nor to what place or places, its letters or telegrams were directed. Nor does the application aver even a probability that the testimony can be had at some time in the future, not unreasonably distant. The motion was properly overruled.
Another error assigned is the refusal of the following charge requested by the defendant: “ You are charged, that though the defendant may be guilty of negligence in failing promptly to deliver the message to Dr. Fields, yet if the plaintiff could have obtained medical attention—if he could have gotten another doctor—and by his negligence failed to do so, then yon will not find any damages for the plaintiff for the mental anguish suffered by him after the time he could have obtained such a doctor, as his omission to obtain such a doctor would have been contributory negligence on his part.” This charge is plainly upon the weight of the evidence, inasmuch as it assumes that the omission of the plaintiff to obtain another doctor, after the nonarrival of Dr. Fields on the morning train of the 12th of July, was per se contributory negligence. Whether any act or omission be negligence or not, unless it be so declared by law, is a question for the jury, which they must determine from the definition of negligence given them by the court, and the evidence before them.
The fourth assignment of error is: “ The judgment is contrary to the law and the evidence, because the damage sued for by the plaintiff was such as is known to the law as exemplary damages, and the plaintiff failed to allege and prove such facts as would enable him to recover exemplary damages against a corporation.”
The plaintiff does not sue for exemplary damages. His suit is for the recovery of compensatory damages for mental suffering, which he avers was the proximate result of defendant’s breach of its contract with plaintiff to deliver within a reasonable time his message to Dr. Fields. That mental suffering which is the proximate result of a breach of contract may form the basis for compensatory damages, is not now a debatable question in this State. Stuart v. Tel. Co., 66 Texas, 585, and cases there referred to.
The third assignment of error is, that the damages are excessive. The evidence shows that the telegram was received by the operator at Alvin sometime between 10 and 11 o’clock of the night of the 11th of July; that it was not delivered to Dr. Fields until 11 o’clock a. m. on the 12th; and that had it been delivered promptly the doctor would have reached the residence of plaintiff about 8 o’clock a. m. of the 12th, if not at an earlier hour of that day; that by his failure to receive the message he did not see plaintiff’s child until 8 o’clock p. m. of the same day; that the child was a sufferer all during that day, with no physician upon attendance to alleviate its pain; and it shows also that the father suffered much distress on account of the child and Ms failure to procure the services of a doctor for it, and that the child died some twenty hours after the arrival of the physician.
On the other hand, the evidence shows that the child had been sick with fever for four days before the telegram was sent to Dr. Fields, and that on the morning of the 12th, after the train from Alvin had arrived, without bringing Dr. Fields, the plaintiff was advised by a neighbor and visitor to send for Dr. Cochrane, who resided at Stafford, which place was about eight miles distant, and on the opposite side of the Brazos River from Thompson; that there was a skiff upon which passengers were carried over the river between these two points; but this advice was rejected by the plaintiff, who believed, as he declared, that Dr. Fields would come to the child. The evidence also shows, that the plaintiff could have had but little reason to expect Dr. Fields to reach his house earlier than the hour for the arrival of the train from Alvin, which hour was 8 o’clock a. m., so that the time between the expected and the actual arrival of the doctor was 12 hours.
The plaintiff, it must be borne in mind, is not suing for the recovery of damages for the death of his child, but for damages founded upon the alleged mental anguish suffered by him between the time when the doctor should have arrived and the time when he did arrive. The question is, therefore, Are the damages under the evidence excessive ? The law, it is true, has not fixed any rule for measuring damages in such cases, and the measure of the damages rests in the discretion of the jury. But this is a judicial discretion, to be exercised by the jury without bias or prejudice to either party; and if there be evidence in the case which makes it probable that the minds of the jury were warped by passion in reaching their conclusion, the verdict should be set aside.
If the plaintiff might have procured the services of another physician at an earlier hour than that at which the child was first seen by Dr. Fields, as is insisted by appellant plaintiff could have done, the failure of plaintiff to do this would not bar his claim for damages. Such failure or neglect of the parent would not be contributory negligence, in the sense at least to relieve the appellant of negligence in failing to deliver the message within a reasonable time after it was received at Alvin. But if it be a fact that the parent might have procured another physician to minister to his child between the hours of the arrival of the morning train from Alvin and the hour of Dr. Fields’ arrival, such fact should be considered by the jury in fixing the measure of damages. If another physician could have and had been obtained, the duration of plaintiff’s anguish would have been necessarily shortened; and if he would have been subjected to mental suffering for want of a physician only between the arrival of the morning train from Alvin and the hour when the physician from Stafford would have arrived, then surely plaintiff should not recover damages for the whole time between the expected and the actual arrival of Dr. Fields; for it is not alleged, nor can we presume such to be the fact, that the plaintiff reposed special confidence in the skill of Dr. Fields, and that his grief was that the service of this particular physician could not be had for the suffering child.
In view of the whole evidence, we are of the opinion that it is probable that sympathy for the parent influenced the jury in fixing the damages, and that the damages are excessive.
The judgment of the lower court is reversed and the cause is remanded for another trial.
Reversed and remanded.

219244,W. R. Baker's Executors v. Isa R. De Freese,1893-03-09,"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice.
This is a suit by appellants as the independent executors of the will of W. R. Baker, deceased, of trespass to try title, against Mrs. Isa R. De Freese, for lots 9, 10, and adjacent halves of 11 and 8 in block 277, on the south side of Buffalo Bayou in the city of Houston.
The defendant answered by a plea of not guilty, and that on July 14, 1881, W. R. Baker bought the lots in controversy in his own name, but actually in trust for defendant, and in pursuance of same gave the lots to her, and immediately constructed on the lots for her a dwelling house and other improvements, which he also gave and donated to her, and about October 10, 1882, in pursuance of said purchase and trust, and to perfect the gift, he put defendant in the full and actual possession of the property as her own, and vested the same in her in fee simple forever; and she has ever since that date to the present had and retained the actual, adverse, and exclusive possession of it, with his full knowledge that she was claiming and holding it as her own, and adversely to him; and that on the faith of this gift, and on the faith and belief that the property was hers, she had, after she was put in possession, and during W. R. Baker’s life and with his knowledge, made permanent and valuable improvements upon it, at a cost and to the value of $5000, and has for eight years devoted her whole time, care, and attention to the repairing and preservation of the property to the value of $500 per year; that she would not have done this, or improved the property, had she not believed it hers; and that Mr. Baker during his life always recognized the property as hers, and made no claim to it, although he saw her improving it as her own, and knew she so claimed it.
She pleaded estoppel by reason of the facts set up. and prays enforcement of the gift, and to be quieted in her title and possession.
By a supplemental petition, plaintiffs denied the gift, and pleaded that Mr. Baker bought the lots and erected thereon a commodious residence, with all necessary out-houses, fences, etc., all of which he paid for, and that he did so for the purpose of the defendant occupying the same during his pleasure; that he studiously refrained from any act that would divest him of the title to said property; that he assessed and paid taxes on the same, in his own name, from date of purchase to his death; that he insured the improvements in his own name; that if the defendant placed any improvements on said lots, they were of little value; that the rental value of the property was $40 per month, and far exceeded the value of any improvements; and that during all the time that defendant occupied” said premises W. R. Baker gave to her monthly the sum of $150, which more than compensated defendant for the value of any improvements, and for any service rendered by her in preserving and improving the premises.
To this the defendant, by supplemental answer, replied, that if Mr. Baker assessed and paid taxes on the property or insured it, he did so for her. That it was his habit and custom to take charge of the property of his sister and of this defendant, and to assess and insure same in his own name, and his doing so was not for the purpose of claiming it as his own. That in 1879 she was living in Grimes County, in her home, on a small farm, on which she was able to make a support for herself and her minor children; that she was the youngest and only sister of Mrs. Hester E. Baker, the wife of W. R. Baker, and they (Mrs. Baker and W. R. Baker) induced her in 1879 to leave her farm in Grimes County and come to Houston, to be and live near her sister, upon their expressed promise and stipulation that he (Baker) would give and donate her a house and lots for a home in Houston, and would assist her besides to support herself and her children. That he was a man of large wealth, and knowing that it would be no imposition on him, she left her home in Grimes County and moved to Houston, in reliance upon the said promise, which he (Baker) fulfilled, by giving her this property, and by assisting her with money to support herself and her children; that her improvements made upon and her care of the property have greatly enhanced its value, and that it would be now inequitable and unjust to permit Mr. Baker’s executors to maintain a claim against her which he himself never thought of asserting; that it would damage her irreparably, and leave her homeless and penniless.
The case was tried by a jury, and a verdict and judgment rendered for the defendant, and the case comes here on appeal from that judgment by plaintiffs in the court below.
From this statement of the nature of the plaintiff’s suit, and the answers of the defendant, it will be seen, that the defense relied on is a paroi sale or donation, with part performance thereof, from the plaintiffs’ testator to the defendant. What constitutes part performance of a paroi sale or gift of land, and such as will relieve the purchaser or donee from the operation of that section of the statute of frauds which requires every sale or gift of land to be evidenced by writing, has long been a vexed question.
By many of the most eminent jurists and judges of this country it has been held, that if the purchaser or donee was placed in possession of the premises by the vendor or donor, or if possession was taken with his knowledge and consent, under an expressed promise from him to convey the property, such naked possession constituted part performance of the contract, and would take the sale or gift out of the operation of the statute, and the purchaser or donee might compel the owner to convey title, by deed, to the property; otherwise, the owner, by repudiating his promise, might subject the occupant of the land to damages for trespass.
By other courts it has been held, that mere possession of the premises is not sufficient to avoid the statute, but that the possession must be coupled with the erection of valuable and permanent improvements upon the property by the vendee or donee.
And still other courts have held, that though possession be taken under a paroi contract or promise to convey, and the occupant, relying upon such promise, and with the knowledge and consent of the promisor, makes valuable and permanent improvements upon the land, yet if the rents and profits of the premises exceed the value of the improvements, the vendor or donor can not be compelled to execute his contract.
The Supreme Court of this State, it would seem, has given its assent to this latter doctrine in the cases of Ann Berta Lodge v. Leverton, 42 Texas, 18; Eason v. Eason, 61 Texas, 227; Wooldridge v. Hancock, 70 Texas, 18; and perhaps in others. But in the case of Murphy v. Stell, 43 Texas, 135, the court holds, the same judge delivering the opinion in that case and the opinion in the case of Ann Berta Lodge v. Leverton, that possession, and permanent and valuable improvements, made with the consent of the vendor, and in reliance upon his promise to convey, are sufficient to give title and to enforce specific performance of the paroi agreement to convey the land. To permit the donor, says the court, to recover the land from his son, to whom he had given it, after the son, relying upon the promise of the father to convey the land to him, had, with the knowledge and consent of the father, erected permanent and valuable improvements upon the premises, would be to sanction a fraud. Nothing whatever is said in the opinion about the rents and profits of the land during the son’s possession.
In the ease of Wells et al. v. Davis, 77 Texas, 636, the plaintiff Wells brought suit against the defendant, Mrs. Nellie Davis, to recover a house and two adjoining lots in the city of Sherman. Defendant by her answer averred, that in 1882 W. W. Walker, from whom plaintiff purchased, donated to her the lots in controversy and placed her in possession of same, and that relying on his promise to make her a deed, she had, with Ms knowledge and without objection from him, placed valuable and permanent improvements on the lots, and that she had occupied the premises as the homestead of herself and family from the date of the alleged donation. Walker, who was a party to this suit, denied that he had made a gift of the property to defendant; and averred that defendant was indebted to him in large sums of money advanced to her' and for her account, and for the rent of the premises; and averred that the rental value of the lots was in excess of the value of the improvements. Upon the trial the evidence showed, that the rents of the premises, from the date of the alleged donation to the date of sale by Walker to Wells, were, as averred by Walker, in excess of the improvements made by the defendant. The jury was charged in accordance with the rule announced in Eason v. Eason, Wooldridge v. Hancock, and Bradley v. Owsley; and verdict and judgment were rendered for defendant; from which the plaintiff appealed, and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court.
Judge Henry, in delivering the opinion of the court, says: “ When the owner of land has given it to another, or when he has sold it and the| purchase money has been paid, and the vendee or donee has been placed in possession, and has in consequence thereof placed upon the land improvements of a character that a court of equity will estimate as being within themselves of sufficient importance and value to entitle the party to a decree for the specific performance of the contract, the use of the premises from the date of such possession must be treated as going with the equitable right of the property itself. In this case, the amount expended in the improvement of the land, compared to the value of the land itself, can not be treated as unimportant. The circumstances under which the improvements were made must be considered. Possession of the property as a homestead was retained by the donee for several years without objection. Under the terms of the gift, she had assurance that her possession of the property was to be permanent, and that her title to the property was to be made perfect. She was justified in believing that she was its owner, and not a renter. It would be a wrong to her to treat, under such circumstances, improvements placed on the property for the permanent enhancement of its comfort and value as mere offsets against the rents, to be applied whenever the holder of the legal title might see proper to eject her. We think the charge of the court was more favorable to the plaintiff than he had a right to demand, under the circumstances of this case.”
Under this state of the decisions of the Supreme Court of this State, this court feels at liberty to reject the rule, which would seem to require that in every case of paroi sale or gift of land in which the vendee seeks to recover, upon the ground of possession and permanent and valuable improvements made in reliance upon the promise of the vendor or donor, and with his consent, the rental value of the premises must be set off against the value of the improvements, regardless of their nature and their relative value to that of the land; and to follow a rule, in our opinion, more in consonance with the principles of equity, and which is more nearly in line with the consensus of judicial opinions of the present day.
We hold, therefore, that when a paroi sale or donation is made, and the vendee or donee goes in possession of the land with the consent of the vendor or donor, and in reliance upon the contract or promise of the vendor or donor, and with his knowledge and without objections from him, makes permanent and valuable improvements upon the land, and of value in reasonable proportion to that of the premises so improved, and occupies the same as his home, in a suit for specific performance by his donee or vendee, the vendor or donor can not set off the rental value of the premises against the improvement; and the vendee or donee under such circumstances must be held and treated as the equitable owner of the land, and can not be considered as the tenant of the holder of the legal title. Wells v. Davis, 77 Texas, 637; Pome, on Spec. Perf., secs. 126-129, and case cited in the notes to said sections; Young v. Denning, 6 Watts, 509.
Applying this rule to the case now under consideration, the judgment must be affirmed. The evidence establishes conclusively, that the premises were donated to defendant by the plaintiffs’ testator in 1882; that she was at that time placed in possession by the donor, and that she had continued to occupy the premises ever since as a home for herself and children; that prior to the year 1879, she was living in Grimes County, upon a small farm owned by her, and that the said Baker, who was the husband of defendant’s only sister, and who was much attached to the defendant, persuaded her to abandon her home in Grimes County, and to come to Houston to live, assuring defendant that he would not only give her a home, but would assist her in supporting her children; and that in fulfillment of this promise, the said Baker purchased the lots in question for her in 1881, and in 1882 constructed a comfortable dwelling upon the same, and placed defendant in possession of the same, and donated both the lots and improvements thereon to her; and that the said Baber always afterwards regarded the place as property of defendant, and so declared to many persons on various occasions, and made such declarations within a few days of his death, whichvoccurred in 1890; that after defendant took possession of the property, Baker was often at her house up to the time of his death; that he treated defendant with great kindness and liberality; that being a man of large means, he contributed monthly to the support of herself and children the sum of §75; that believing that she was the owner of the place, defendant, with full knowledge of Baker, and without objection from him, made large improvements upon the place of a permanent and valuable character, and which enhanced both the value and the comfort of the premises; such as raising the lots so as to protect them from overflow, building chimneys and out-houses, improving the sidewalks, and planting shrubbery and shade trees, besides other and less valuable improvements, as rebuilding the cisterns, repainting the house, and repairing the water mains.
It was also proved, that these improvements were not made with the money given defendant by Baker, but with her own means, and such as were furnished by her sons. The original cost of the lots and the house erected by Baker was shown to be about $5000. The improvements-placed upon the premises were estimated to be worth $2500. This estimate was not contradicted, and was the only evidence offered as to the value of the improvements. The plaintiffs offered evidence as to the rental value of the premises. The evidence on this subject, taken most favorably for appellants, shows that the value of the improvements were somewhat in excess of the rents. Plaintiffs also proved, that Baker was a careful and methodical business man, and that the property in litigation was insured by Baker, and was described as “ occupied by a tenant;” and further, that it was assessed in the name of Baker, and that the taxes-were paid by him.
Under these circumstances it would, in our judgment, inflict a wrong upon the defendant to permit the plaintiffs to recover the lands, and a court of equity could not have rendered a judgment for the plaintiffs. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the assignments of error upon the giving and refusal of charges by the court; it is immaterial what charges were given or what were refused. Eason v. Eason, 61 Texas; Teal v. Terrell, 58 Texas, 257; and Mitchell v. De Witt, 20 Texas, 294.

219190,"Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. A. J. Harris",1893-03-13,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
Appellee, Harris, brought this suit in a Justice Court for the recovery of the value of a mule alleged to have been negligently killed by the appellant while in its use.
Plaintiff had hired certain teams, with drivers selected and paid by himself, to the defendant for use in constructing a grade for a siding on its road in Burleson County. The drivers and teams were in the charge and under the direction of a foreman in the employment of defendant, who superintended the grading, and the owner had no control over them after they were carried on the works. A scraper was used, and the usual way of making a fill, and one less attendant with danger, was for the teams, after having the scrapers dumped, to turn back in the grade completed, and not in front of the fill, as was the manner of constructing the fill where the mule was injured. When the mule was hurt, the driver, under the direction of the foreman, was driving the mules down in front of the fill, and the scraper struck the end of a tie, was turned over, and fell forward on the hind legs of one of the mules, and cut them so severely that the animal died in a few days.
The regular driver was not driving on that day, and the driver in charge was one suggested by defendant’s foreman, but he took charge of the team with the consent of the plaintiff, who was present.
Plaintiff had been working on the track with his teams for several months, and knew of the danger that attended the employment. It was testified, that the mule was hurt the first time it started down the dump, but plaintiff knew of the manner in which the particular fill was being constructed, and had just left the place, and was not over 200 or 300 yards distant when the mule was hurt. It was in evidence that the foreman was drinking, but plaintiff knew of this also.
The danger of the work was well known to plaintiff, and he was aware-of the increased danger that attended the manner of the construction of the fill on which his mule was injured, and he will be deemed to have assumed whatever risk there was. He ought not to recover. This conclusion is reached without a decision of the question as to whether or not the plaintiff should be affected by the contributory negligence of his servant-who was driving the team.
As the case was tried without a jury, the judgment of the court below will be reversed, and here rendered for the appellant.

219257,The City of Houston v. Mary A. Bryan,1893-03-23,"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.
Defendant in error, Mrs. Bryan, who was plaintiff below, owned a homestead situated at the corner of Main and Calhoun Streets in the city of Houston. When her homestead was improved in 1869, there was a ditch, known as “the city ditch,” kept open by the city, which ran along Calhoun Street, passing by her property, and which afforded sufficient drainage for that and the neighboring lands.
Subsequently the city dug ditches along other streets above her property, which opened into the city ditch at right angles, thus conducting into it a volume of water larger than had formerly passed through it; too large, indeed, for its capacity as it was originally made. Weeds and rubbish were allowed to accumulate in the city ditch in the neighborhood of Mrs. Bryan’s property, and to gradually and materially diminish its depth, thus rendering it still less sufficient to carry off the water which concentrated there when there was copious rainfalls. The consequence was, that the water was impeded in the passage opposite to her house, backed up to the Main Street crossing, and there overflowed, running into her yard and house and damaging her.
It sufficiently appears from the evidence, that by means of the other ditches which were opened into the city ditch, water was collected and emptied into it which would not otherwise have flowed through it, but would have passed off in other directions; and that because of this increase and the filling up of the city ditch, plaintiff’s property was overflowed at every rain of the duration of an hour or two. This overflowing of plaintiff’s property began six or seven years before the trial, and seems to have increased in magnitude up to the time this suit was brought.
In the trial below, defendant having pleaded the statute of limitations, plaintiff was restricted in her recovery to such damages as she had sustained within two years next preceding the institution of this suit. She introduced evidence tending to show, that within that time, by the operation of the water which flowed into her house, a floor had rotted out which it cost her §120 or §125 to replace; that she and her young daughters had been made ill with chills and fever for about half the time, and had incurred from §200 to §300 as doctor’s bills; that bad odors had been generated, and that her house was rendered damp and uncomfortable for a large part of the time. There was evidence of much further damage, such as the destruction of garden, shrubbery, flowers, etc., and the rotting of other floors, but the time when it occurred and the .value of the things destroyed or injured are not shown.
In view of the verdict, we find the foregoing facts to have been established. Quite a number of witnesses gave it as their opinion, that the overflows of plaintiff’s premises were not increased, but rather diminished by the ditch, and that her property was not injured but benefited by it.
But facts to which other witnesses testified, if true, rendered it apparent that those opinions were based upon a partial conception of the question, and the jury was warranted in disregarding them.
The city was not originally bound to furnish ditches or sewers for the purpose of draining plaintiff’s property of the surface water which naturally passed over it, and it was not therefore bound to keep open the ditch which it had dug, so long as it did not by its negligence increase- or divert the flow of such surface water to plaintiff’s injury.
But when it collected water from other territory and concentrated it in this ditch, it was bound to provide sufficient outlet for it, so that it would not be forced upon plaintiff’s land in larger quantities than would have flowed over it without such act. The rule of law applicable in such cases is thus stated by Judge Dillon: “ There will be liability [of a. municipal corporation] if the direct effect of the work, particularly if it be a sewer or drain, is to collect an increased body of water and to precipitate it on the adjoining private property to its injury.” And further: “ There is municipal liability where the property of private persons is flooded, either directly or by water being set back, when this is the result of the negligent execution of the plan adopted for the construction of gutters, drains, culverts, or sewers, or of the negligent failure to keep the same in repair and free from obstruction; and this whether the lots are below the grade of the street or not.” Dill, on Mun. Corp., 1051; see, also, Gross v. Lampasas, 74 Texas, 195.
It follows from this that the city was liable upon the facts above stated.
The court gave the jury the following instructions, of which numbers 1 and 3 are assigned as error:
“ 1. ""As to any injury resulting to plaintiff from overflow of city ditch, if any, you will find for plaintiff, if from the evidence you find such overflow was occasioned by reason of negligence in the city authorities charged with that duty in not maintaing such ditch in proper repair and condition.
“ 2. If you find that plaintiff’s property was overflowed from Main Street, or from surface water flowing on it or on adjacent property not occasioned from said city ditch, then your verdict should be for defendant.
“ 3. If you find from the evidence that plaintiff’s property has been damaged from overflow of the city ditch, if such overflow was-occasioned by reason of bad condition of said city ditch, by reason of weeds, etc., filling up, then you must confine your inquiries to such injuries received within two years next before filing this suit. And you will exclude any or all injuries or damages to plaintiff not occurring within two years next before September, 1890, for all such damages are barred by limitations and can not be allowed for.”
These instructions are complained of as having been 11 calculated to impress the jury with the idea that it was the duty of the city authorities to maintain the ditch in such condition that its capacity would be sufficient to prevent an overflow of plaintiff’s premises from surface water, regardless of the question as to whether the ditch in its then condition was injurious to plaintiff or not.”
The general charge was certainly quite vague and indefinite, and did not inform the jury as to the conditions upon which the liability of the city would depend. We think it is defective rather than positively erroneous.
At the request of plaintiff the following instruction was given: “ If the jury believe from the evidence, that by means of the ditch in question surface water that would naturally have overflowed elsewhere was diverted in large quantities from its natural outlet and carried into the ditch, then if the evidence further shows that the defendant permitted the ditch to become and remain insufficient to carry off the water so collected in it, and that by reason thereof large quantities of water, diverted from its natural outlet, were thrown from said ditch upon the plaintiff’s premises, the plaintiff is entitled to recover such damages, if any, as resulted to her therefrom under the rules elsewhere given, and the jury shall so find.”
And the court at defendant’s request charged as follows: “ Defendant can not be held liable for a mere neglect to provide ditches of sufficient capacity to properly drain the premises of the plaintiff; and if the overflows, if any, of the plaintiff’s premises were not caused by any direct act or omission on the part of defendant, or if said premises would have overflowed to as great an extent without the acts of the defendant complained of, then you will find for the defendant.”
The rules upon which they were to rest their verdict were thus clearly given to the jury, and with the aid of these special charges there was no probability of a misunderstanding of the main charge.
The other charge asked by defendant, so far as it is correct, was involved in that which was given. The effect upon the case of the two charges would be the same, except that the one which was not given was incorrect in one particular. It is as follows:
“If you believe from the evidence, that notwithstanding the negligence, if any, of the city in failing to keep the ditch on Calhoun Street in proper repair and of sufficient capacity, the premises of the plaintiff 'have nevertheless been as well drained for the last two years as the same would have been had no ditch been there, you will find for the defendant.”
It might be true that the premises have been as well drained for the last two years as the same would have been had not the city ditch been there, consistently with defendant’s liability. The other ditches had been opened into it more than two years before the trial, and while it may be conceded that this ditch, defective as it was, helped to carry off the water thus collected, and thereby drained the land as well or better than it would have been drained had it not been there, it by no means follows that it was sufficient to conduct away the increased flow which had been introduced into it since its original construction. Unless it was sufficient to do that, defendant was liable.
The fourth assignment is too general. The fifth is, that the verdict is excessive.
The verdict can not be sustained upon the proof of the killing of fruit trees, gardens, shrubbery, flowers, etc., because no statement was made of their value. The same is true as to the rotting of floors. The plaintiff could not recover the full cost of putting in a new floor, because the value of the old one was not entirely destroyed. The testimony of the plaintiff and of the doctor, taken together, did, however, establish as well as can be required the facts, that plaintiff was made sick, that her health was gradually undermined, and that she was exposed to bad odors and discomforts and to much inconvenience, resulting from the flooding of her house, and that her bills incurred to Dr. Burroughs alone amounted in one year to 8200 or $300. As we understand his evidence, he attributes these bills to the sickness resulting from the causes assigned. In view of these facts, we can not say that the jury was not warranted in finding a verdict for plaintiff, nor that the amount they awarded, $675, is excessive.
The judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered March 23, 1893."
219097,"Gulp, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. R. D. Simonton",1893-03-23,"GARRETT, Chief Justice.
R. D. Simonton brought this suit in the District Court of Montgomery County, against the Gulf, Colorado <fe Santa Fe Railway Company, to recover damages for depredations upon his crops and premises by stock, which, as alleged in the petition, entered said premises through openings left by defendant in the construction of its railway.
There was no proof that stock entered by any other opening left by the defendant than over the platform of its depot building, which extended about four feet into plaintiff’s enclosure. With respect to this opening, after alleging that the company was operating its railway through the enclosed premises of plaintiff, consisting of about 200 acres of land, including farm, pasture, garden, truck patches, lawn, barns, lots, yard, residence, etc., all adjacent to the town of Montgomery, and had negligently and wrongfully torn down and destroyed and removed plaintiff’s fence; and having specified two other openings left unguarded, the petition averred, that “ another of said openings in plaintiff’s said fence and enclosure is where defendant company unlawfully and willfully tore down and removed plaintiff’s fence, and constructed and extended its depot platform from its depot on the outside of said enclosure to a point on the inside of said enclosure, and this place said defendant company did then negligently leave open, and has ever since negligently left open, an easy passage way for stock of all kinds into said enclosed premises of plaintiff; and did then and there negligently fail and omit, and has ever since negligently failed and omitted, to guard or protect said place with a cattle guard, or hinder the invasion of said premises by stock through said openings;” and further averred, that by the construction of its depot platform into said enclosure from the outside, a broad, easy, and inviting opening was made into the premises for stock of all kinds, to-wit, “ a low, broad, flat structure, or apron walk, made of pine lumber, and not exceeding fourteen inches in heighth, upon which hogs and cattle and all other stock can and do easily enter and pass into said enclosure.” It was averred, that plaintiff had often requested the defendant to erect cattle guards and restore said fence, or to provide some adequate means or devices to protect his said farm and premises against the invasion and depredation of stock, invited and made easy by said openings.
Damages were laid at 81500 actual damages, which were itemized under quite a number of heads. Exemplary damages were also claimed by reason of defendant’s alleged gross and willful negligence in failing after-repeated notices to fix the openings; but the portion of the petition setting up exemplary damages, on exception made by defendant, was stricken out by the court. Defendant pleaded also contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff, and want of due care. An exception in the nature of a general demurrer, made by the plaintiff to the plea of contributory negligence, was sustained by the court, and so much of the answer stricken out.
Trial was had without a jury, and the court rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff for $700.
Defendant’s plea of contributory negligence was, that plaintiff, by building a few yards of fence around defendant’s passenger depot, could have prevented all the damages. The pleading does not advise us as to whether or not the plaintiff had a right to build the fence so as to close the passage over the platform, nor of other facts that might be pertinent to the inquiry as to whether or not the fence could have been built; but we are of opinion that it was good on general demurrer, and that the court erred in striking it out on plaintiff’s exception. As far as shown by the evidence, defendant’s plea of contributory negligence might have been good.
Plaintiff testified: “I have a farm and premises joining next to the depot of defendant in the town of Montgomery. Defendant’s road runs through it. Defendant’s passenger platform at said depot extends [upon] the line of the east fence enclosing my premises, and into the same about four feet, said platform being about two feet above the ground, and hogs and cattle walk over the said platform into my premises, and have been doing so continually for about fourteen months.”
There was no evidence that stock ever entered plaintiff’s premises through any hole in his fence made by defendant, except over said platform.
There was no other evidence as to the position of the depot and fence, and it does not appear but that plaintiff built his fence after the depot building had been put up. But if we may assume that the back part of the platform extends about four feet into the pasture, that the building was constructed after the fence had been built, and that the track at this place lay outside the pasture, we do not think that the statute with reference to cattle guards would be applicable in such case. It is certainly not shown by the evidence to be applicable. Rev. Stats., art. 4240; Railway v. Young, 60 Texas, 202; Railway v. Adams, 63 Texas, 204.
The amount of damages as found by the court is clearly excessive. Plaintiff could not recover more for any particular item of damage than he sustained as alleged in his petition; and when the allegation was that his pasture had been damaged §50, he could not recover more than that sum for damage to his pasture on proof of $200 or $300 damage to it.
It was shown by the evidence, that there was a cross or partition fence between plaintiff’s pasture and his field fence, which he testified was a very poor fence and did not turn hogs. He said he. could have repaired it and protected the property, but he did not regard it as his business, but looked upon it as the duty of the defendant railway to have fixed its exit so that his premises on the inside would have been protected. If this fence could have been repaired at a moderate cost, and the crops thereby protected, it was plaintiff’s duty to have done so; and failing to do it, his measure of damages would be only a sufficient amount of money to have made such repairs.
It is hardly necessary to say that plaintiff should not be allowed to recover for crops that belonged to his tenant, nor for damages thereto caused by stock getting in at other places than over the platform.
The method of getting at the value of crops destroyed has been considered in several cases. Railway v. McGowan, 73 Texas, 355; Railway v. Pape, 73 Texas, 502. If the witness should qualify himself as an expert, his opinion as to the value of a crop at a particular stage of development should be received. Railway v. Borsky, decided by this court on March 16, 1893 [ante, p. 545].
The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.

219231,W. C. O. Driscoll et al. v. W. A. Morris et al.,1893-03-09,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
On the 1st day of August, 1873, judgment was rendered in the District Court for Harris County, Texas, in favor of W. C. O. Driscoll against S. S. Munger for §931.16 in gold, and bearing interest at the rate of 30 per cent per annum from rendition, a copy of which was properly recorded in Montague County on January 12,1874.
On the 2d day of June, 1874, an execution was issued on said judgment, directed to the sheriff or any constable of Harris County, and was returned unsatisfied, the return stating that no property of defendant was. found in said county subject to execution.
On the 1st day of August, 1874, S. S. Munger conveyed the land in controversy to W. C. McGowan by general warranty deed, which was recorded in Montague County, August 24, 1874.
On the first Tuesday in March, 1875, the land in controversy was sold under an execution issued upon the judgment aforesaid, and at said sale defendant W. A. Morris bid it in for the sum of §26.50, and sometime thereafter had a deed made to himself, but at the time of said bid he was the agent of Driscoll, the plaintiff in the execution, and was bidding for him.
This suit was instituted in 1875 by Driscoll against Morris to have the deed to the latter declared a trust in favor of the former. In this suit McGowan intervened. Since the filing of his plea of intervention, McGowan has died, leaving the appellees B. A. McGowan, Floyd McGowan, Mary Slaughter, and Josephine Runech as his heirs. W. C. O. Driscoll has also died, leaving appellant McKinnon and one Margaret Drew as his. only heirs. The last named having released all her interest to McGowan, the plea of intervention by McKinnon at the trial below was prosecuted to recover only a one-lialf interest in the land. The land at the time of the execution sale aforesaid was worth from $1.50 to $2 per acre, and the price at which it was bid in by Morris was a grossly inadequate consideration therefor.
The verdict of the jury under the charge of the court establishes, that at the time of the issuance of the first execution upon the judgment in favor of Driscoll to Harris County, the defendant Munger had personal property in that county subject to execution sufficient to satisfy the same, but the sheriff did not call upon him for a levy, and he had no opportunity to point out said property. The execution upon which the land was sold did not show upon its face that any previous execution had been issued upon the judgment, and it appeared to have been issued more than one year after the rendition thereof. There was no direct evidence that the irregularities above referred to conduced to the inadequacy of the consideration at which the land was sold.
Upon the verdict of the jury judgment was rendered in the court below cancelling the sheriff’s sale of the land, and in favor of the heirs of McGowan for the recovery thereof, from which plaintiff McKinnon appeals. The other defendants claim under Morris, and none of them occupy the position of innocent purchasers, and they have not appealed from the judgment rendered against them. The case has already twice been before our Supreme Court. 53 Texas, 213; 11 S. W. Kep., 532.
The court below gave the following charge to the jury: “ If you find from the evidence that said S. S. Munger resided in Harris County, where the judgment in favor of Driscoll against him was rendered, and owned personal property situated in said county subject to execution at the time of the suing out of said execution sufficient to satisfy said judgment, but that said Driscoll, without pointing out said personal property or causing the sheriff to require said Munger to point out said property, sued out the execution to Montague County without the knowledge of said Munger, and caused the land in controversy to be sold under said execution without the knowledge of said Munger, these facts, if you find they are true, would constitute an irregularity.”
Appellant in his first assignment complains of this charge, “ because there was no testimony to warrant same, and because the same is not the law, and was calculated to mislead and confuse the jury; and because, if an irregularity, could not have injured the rights of appellees nor in any way have affected the sale of the land to the prejudice of the judgment debtor, and is a charge upon the weight of the evidence.” The other members of the court are of opinion that none of these objections to the charge are well taken, and we are all of opinion that the charge is not subject to either of the objections made to it in the propositions presented by appellant under this assignment.
The first proposition by appellant under this assignment is as follows:
“ Mere irregularities in making a judicial sale, when taken in connection with gross inadequacy of consideration, will not alone be held a sufficient ground to vacate such sale, unless the facts show that the identical irregularities conduced to such inadequacy of price.” A subsequent paragraph of the charge completely meets this proposition. This paragraph of the charge is as follows: “ If you find from the evidence that the land in controversy, at the sale thereof on the 2d day of March, 1875, when the same was struck off to W. A. Morris as the agent of W. C. 0. Driscoll, sold for a grossly inadequate price, and that the irregularities above mentioned conduced to such inadequacy of price, then you will find for the intervenor; but if you find from the evidence that said land did not sell for a grossly inadequate price, or if it did sell for a grossly inadequate price, yet if the irregularities herein before mentioned did not conduce thereto, then you can not find for the intervenor; and the burthen of proof is on the intervenor to show that said land sold for a grossly inadequate price, and that the irregularities above mentioned, or some of them, conduced thereto.” We are of opinion that this charge presented the law upon the question involved in the proposition as favorably to appellant as the previous decisions of our Supreme Court would justify. Allen v. Pierson, 60 Texas, 604; McKinnon v. McGowan, 11 S. W. Rep., 532; Irvin v. Ferguson, 83 Texas, 491.
The second proposition submitted under this assignment was as follows:
“ The trial court should never go out of the record and hatch up theories and charge on general propositions of law when the facts of the case at bar do not support it.” It will be observed that the charge complained of only instructed the jury that certain facts therein detailed, if found to exist, would constitute an irregularity. Munger, the defendant in the execution, testified that he had personal property in Harris County sufficient to satisfy the judgment, and that no one called upon him for a levy, and he had no opportunity to point out the same. There is evidence in the record which tends to contradict his statement that he had such property, but none beyond the return of the officer that he was called upon for a levy; and we agree, that if the facts as detailed in the charge constitute an irregularity in law, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict of the jury finding that they in fact did exist, and that this proposition therefore is not well taken.
Appellant in his second assignment of error complains at the action of the court in charging the jury, that the failure of the execution under which the land was sold to show on its face that the judgment had been kept alive by the issuance of previous executions was an irregularity; the ground of objection being, as alleged by appellant, that the execution did show that two previous executions had been issued, and because, if an irregularity, it could not have injured the rights of either Hunger or appellees, and was a charge upon the weight of the evidence. It is recited in the statement of facts, that the execution was in the usual form, except that on its face it made no mention of any previous execution having been issued on said judgment, and did not mention any rate of interest; but the bill of costs attached to the execution contained one item, as follows: “Alias execution, .75; pluries, .75; total, Si.50.” And the execution was endorsed as follows: “ W. C. O. Driscoll v. S. S. Munger. Al. execution. Issued January 11, 1875.”
We are of opinion that the court did not err in holding that these recitals did not comply with paragraph 7 of article 2281 of the Revised Statutes, which says, “ When an alias or pluries execution is issued, it shall show upon its face the number of previous executions which have been issued on the judgment;” and we are also of opinion that the charge was not upon the weight of the evidence. It was proper for the court to tell the jury that this failure to comply with the plain requirements of the statute was an irregularity.
Appellant’s fourth and sixth assignments complain at the failure of the court in its charge to instruct the jury, that the fact that Driscoll’s judgment lien was prior to the sale to McGowan would prevent those claiming under McGowan from setting aside the sale on account of the irregularities and gross inadequacy of the consideration above referred to; but we are of opinion that this is not the law of the case. We do not understand that the fact that appellant’s lien may have been prior in time would prevent those owning the land from objecting to irregularities in its sale. They were still interested in its bringing its full value, notwithstanding such prior lien. If, however, they succeeded in setting aside the sale, this would not cancel such lien if it existed, and appellant, unless precluded upon other grounds, could still enforce the same. The land would still remain subject to the judgment. Appellant does not contend that in such case it would be necessary for the owner of the land to tender the full amount of the judgment in order to vacate the sale, nor are we prepared to hold this to be the law had he so contended.
Upon the trial in the court below intervenors offered in evidence as a recorded instrument the deed from Hunger to McGowan, the certificate of acknowledgment to which did not recite that the grantor was known to the officer, to which appellant objected. This acknowledgment was taken in 1874, and it has been decided that the law in force at that time did not require the officer to certify that the grantor was known to him, but only required him, in case the grantor was not known, to attach certain proof of his identity. These proofs not being attached to the certificate of acknowledgment, we think it should be presumed that the grantor was known to the officer, and the acknowledgment therefore be held sufficient. Watkins v. Hall, 57 Texas, 4.
Appellant’s only remaining assignment of error isas follows: “Because the court erred in not giving the plaintiff a new trial.” Plaintiff’s motion for a new trial embraced a number of distinct grounds, and appellees object to our considering it because it is too general, and we think this objection must be sustained under repeated decisions of our Supreme Court. The sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict and judgment is therefore not presented for our consideration; but we do not wish to be understood as intimating that even if it had been so presented we would hold it insufficient. As to this, we do not decide.
We are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.
Affirmed.

219147,Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. J. F. Martino,1893-03-16,"FISHER, Judge, Section B.
This suit is by appellee to recover from appellant $5000 as damages resulting from injuries received by his wife in travelling from St. Louis, Missouri, to Dallas, Texas. The case was tried by a jury, and resulted in a verdict and judgment in appellee’s favor for $2020.45.
The petition, in substance, alleges: That on or about the 13tli day of September, 1886, plaintiff’s wife wishing to visit the city of St. Louis, he purchased from the agent of the Houston & Texas Central Railway Company at Dallas, Texas, a first class excursion ticket for his wife from Dallas, Texas, to St. Louis and return.
That he paid for said ticket the sum of $20.80; that said agent then and there stamped said ticket and the said Lillie Martino signed the same, as-required by the terms of said ticket. That said ticket was good for the-return trip until October 29, 1886. That on the 13th day of September,. 1886, the said Lillie Martino, with her little child, started from Dallas on the cars of the Houston & Texas Central Railway, and proceeded on said cars to Denison, Texas, and then proceeded to St. Louis from Denison on defendant’s road. That in going to St. Louis said ticket was duly honored by the conductors of said roads, and that the said Lillie Martino had no trouble in going from Dallas to St. Louis.
The petition then alleges, that said Lillie Martino, having finished her visit at St. Louis, on October 6, 1886, presented said ticket to the agent of defendant at its office in St. Louis, and requested him to sign and stamp-the same, as required by the terms of said ticket. That said agent looked at said ticket contemptuously, handed it back to said Lillie Martino, and refused to have it signed or stamped, saying it was “ no good.” That she was a stranger in St. Louis, and had spent all the money she had taken with her, and having with her her little child, did not know what to do. That she got on defendant’s train of cars at St. Louis and started home. That the conductor from St. Louis to Sedalia examined her ticket and passed her to Sedalia without objection. That at Sedalia another conductor took charge of said train; that she showed him her ticket, and that he refused to honor the same. That she told him she had no money, and that he then took her baggage check and told her he would let her ride to Dallas, and that he would notify the next conductor of this arrangement.
That at Parsons, Kansas, the next conductor took charge of said train, and that when he came round for tickets it was midnight, and that she was lying with her head on the seat in front of her and was asleep. That this conductor, upon reaching her, caught her by the hair and jerked her head back, nearly breaking her neck, and said to her in a violent and insulting manner, “ Madam, your ticket.” That his manner was so violent and insulting that she became very much frightened. That she told him she had given the conductor from Sedalia to Parsons her trunk check, and that said conductor had promised she could ride to Dallas, and that she asked the conductor if the former conductor had not told him that he had her check for her trunk. That the conductor then in a very insulting manner told her he knew nothing about her trunk check, and that she must either pay her fare or get off the train. That she told him she had no money. Then he told her to give him her watch and chain as security for her fare, and that he would let her ride to Dallas. That he said “ pay me the fare, give me your jewelry, or get off the train.” That, being alone with her little child and among strangers, and the conduct of the conductor being so violent and harsh, she did not know what to do, and gave him her watch and chain. That he then handed her back her trunk check, although he had just before denied having it.
That when said train reached Denison, said conductor deposited said watch and chain with appellant’s ticket agent there to secure her fare to Dallas. That plaintiff afterwards had to send to the ticket agent at Denison $20.45 to redeem said watch and chain for fare wrongfully charged his said wife. That when plaintiff met his wife at the train on her arrival at Dallas, she was in tears and nearly distracted; and she then told him of the wrongs, insults, and indignities she had suffered on her trip at the hands of defendant’s agents; that he took her home, and she was sick and confined in her room for a number of days, and was unable to attend to her duties, and the same caused your petitioner much pain and anguish; that all such sickness, pain, and anguish was caused from acts of defendant’s agents as aforesaid.
Defendant pleaded a general demurrer, and excepted specially:
First. To all that portion of said petition which charges that its agent at St. Louis refused to countersign said ticket as required by the terms of said ticket, and that said agent contemptuously handed the ticket back to plaintiff’s wife, saying it was no good; that Mrs. Martino was without money and did not know what to do, and got upon defendant’s train, etc.; because the same are irrelevant and inadmissible matters in this suit, and were injected in it to prejudice the rights of appellant.
Second. To the allegations of pain and anguish suffered by petitioner, because the husband’s anguish is too remote.
Third. To the allegations of said petitioner charging that its conductor-approached plaintiff’s wife while she was asleep, and caught her by the-hair and jerked her and nearly broke her neck, because said allegations-are too improbable and lack verity on the face thereof.
Defendant further pleaded a general denial, and specially pleaded that . according to the terms of said ticket or contract, in order for Lillie Martino to be entitled to return thereon from St. Louis to Dallas, it was contracted and agreed, for and on account of the reduced rate or charges-therefor, that she would sign said ticket at St. Louis and have the same stamped by defendant’s agent at St. Louis, and that if she failed so to do,, that""said ticket was to become null and void; that she did fail so to do, and that said conductor, as he was in duty bound to do according to the terms of said ticket or contract, refused to accept said ticket and demanded her fare.
Defendant expressly denied that its conductor caught plaintiff’s wife by the hair, or jerked her, or in any other way mistreated her, but that-he, to the contrary, treated her kindly, credited her for her fare from St. Louis to Dallas, taking security therefor, she being a stranger to him,, which amount plaintiff afterward paid, as he was in duty bound to do, upon which payment the watch and chain given as security for her fare were returned to her.
The court overruled the general and special demurrers.
These are the facts briefly stated: September 13, 1886, appellee, for the use of his wife, purchased from the Houston & Texas Central Eailway Company at Dallas, Texas, a first class tourist ticket, good until October 29, 1886. The ticket was signed by Mrs. Lillie Martino, the wife of appellee, and entitled her to passage from Dallas, Texas, to St. Louis, Missouri, and return. The ticket contains a stipulation, that it is not good for return passage unless the holder signs the same and identifies himself as the original purchaser to the satisfaction of the authorized agent of the-Missouri Pacific Eailway Company at St. Louis, Missouri, on or before-October 15, 1886, and when duly witnessed by the agent and dated in ink, and duly stamped by said agent, the ticket shall then be good until October 29, 1886; and that the original purchaser agrees to sign his name- and otherwise identify himself as such whenever called upon to do so by any conductor or agent of the lines over which the ticket reads; and on failure or refusal the ticket shall become void.
Mrs. Martino travelled from Dallas to St. Louis on the ticket. About October 5 or 6, 1886, desirous of returning to Dallas, she presented the ticket to the ticket agent of the Missouri Pacific Eailway Company at St. Louis, with request to sign and stamp same. The agent returned the ticket to her, with the statement that it was not good, and refused to sign and stamp it. She then, without the ticket being signed or stamped by the St. Louis agent, boarded appellant’s train on her return trip to-Dallas. The conductor oh appellant’s train between St. Louis and Sedalia, Missouri, honored the ticket, and passed her to the latter place. There another conductor took charge of the train and ran it to Parsons, Kansas. The conductor between Sedalia and Parsons examined the ticket and refused to permit her to ride on it, and demanded of her her fare in money. Mrs. Martino then stated to him that she had no money. He then asked if she had any baggage, and upon her replying she had, he then demanded her baggage check, which she delivered to him. The conductor then handed her a paper check, telling her to keep it; that she could ride to Dallas on it.
About midnight another conductor took charge of the train at Parsons, and ran it to Denison. Mrs. Martino testified, “ That it must have been about this time of the night. I was resting my head upon my arm on the seat in front of me, and the conductor came along and struck me on the head hard, and said, 1 Ticket, madam,’ in a very rough manner. He said, ‘I want your ticket.’ I handed him the ticket, but he did not hardly look at it before he said it was not good. He said he would have to have baggage, money, or jewelry, or I would have to get off the train. I said I would like to have, my trunk. I asked him if he knew the name of the man who took my trunk check. He said, ‘ No; I don’t want any explanations; all I want is money, jewelry, or baggage.’ I told him that I did not have any money. He said he wanted my watch and chain. I had my watch in my bosom and the chain was exposed to view. I told him the other conductor had my trunk check. He told me that he did not know anything about the other conductor, and did not know any^ thing about my trunk check. As soon as I handed him my watch and chain he handed me the trunk check. He told me I would have to get off if I did not give him my watch and chain. I told jiim I would telegraph the Exchange Bank for money, but he would not wait. I told him my name, and that it was on my trunk. It xyas a new trunk. It was what you call a lady’s travelling trunk. This conductor was talking very loud. Everybody in the car heard what he said. I gave him my watch and chain, and then he handed me my trunk check. I rode on to Denison all right. * * *
“Theconductor struck me with his hand. He knocked my head back. He struck me and pulled my head back. I had done nothing to him. I was not asleep; I was just resting. He did not say anything, but just hit me, and said, ‘ Ticket, madam.’ I had no warning that he was going to hit me. He said 1 Ticket, madam,’ very roughly, and I handed him my ticket, and he tore off a coupon and said it was not good. I explained to him what the other conductors had done. The coupons from St. Louis to Denison were not taken off the ticket by me. They took them off. The agent at Denison gave me a piece of paper and told me to keep it, and when I should send him $20.45 he would send me my watch and chain. He and the conductor furnished me a ticket from Denison to Dallas. I got home (to Dallas) about 6 o’clock in the evening. I met my husband at the depot. I felt very bad and ashamed when I came home. When I got home, I laid down on the bed for sometime.
“ When the conductor struck me, it was not far from Parsons. It was that time he was taking up fare. The treatment I received from the conductor excited me very much at the time. I felt mortified and ashamed. I could not explain how I did feel. Nobody was with me except a child of mine. I knew no one in the coach. I met my husband at Dallas, at the depot, and told him what had happened to me. I told him all about it. I was crying at the depot at Dallas. I was crying and sobbing at Denison over my treatment. I asked the conductor to get me a ticket from Denison to Dallas. He promised me he would. At Denison I had to hunt him up, and then he and the agent gave me the ticket to Dallas. He told me my fare was $20.45, and I could send him the amount and he would return watch and chain. When I got to Dallas, I sent to the agent at Denison $20.45, and he sent me my watch and chain.”
Appellee Martino testified: “ That he paid $20.80 for the ticket when he purchased it from the Central Railway Company at Dallas. His wife went to the ticket office with him, and she there signed the ticket. I met her at the depot at Dallas on her return. She was looking pale and had been crying. I asked her what was the matter. She said, 11 have got no more watch; the ticket was not good; the ticket agent would not sign it.’ I sent the $20.45 to get the watch and chain. After my wife returned, she was sick and in bed for sometime after she came back. She was confined to her room and in bed in the daytime. That he felt ashamed and bad over it. She told me the way she had been treated by the conductor between Parsons and Denison, and said it made her feel bad and ashamed. Did not send for any physician to see my wife. She was not very sick, but she felt bad over the way she had been treated.”
C. C. Odem, witness for defendant, testified: That he was ticket agent at Dallas, and sold the ticket to Mrs. Martino, and that he had authority to sell it, and that it was sold for one fare for the round trip. The regular fare to St. Louis from Dallas is $20.20.
Witness Waggener, the conductor between Parsons and Denison, contradicts the evidence of Mrs. Martino as to what occurred between them on the train, and denies any ill treatment of her. He further testifies, that he requested her to write her name so that he could identify her signature with that on the ticket, but she refused to do so; and he further states that if she had done so, he would have permitted her to ride on the ticket, and it was upon her refusal that he demanded fare. The conductor also testified that Mrs. Martino, at the time he examined the ticket, told him that she tried to get it signed at St. Louis and could not do so. Mrs. Martino denies that any request was made for her signature, or that she be identified, but she told him her name and that she had letters in her satchel from her husband, and that she could identify herself, and that her name was on her trunk.
Appellant’s first assignment of error relates to the action of the court in overruling defendant’s first special exception; because Mrs. Martino was not entitled to return transportation from St. Louis to Dallas upon said ticket, for the reason that the same had not been signed and stamped at St. Louis, as required by the contract, and that she was a trespasser upon defendant’s train, and the acts of said agent at St. Louis are irrelevant and inadmissible; that plaintiff’s cause of action, if any, is dependent upon the conduct of the conductor.
Appellant’s second assignment of error questions the following charge given by the court:
“ If the evidence before you in this case satisfies your minds that Mrs. Martino, on or before October 29, 1886, went to the authorized agent of the defendant at St. Louis, Missouri, and was ready to identify herself as the original purchaser, and asked and requested said agent to sign and to ■stamp the ticket, and this request was by said agent ref used; and you further find that as a result of said refusal to sign and stamp the ticket, that the conductor in charge of defendant’s train refused to recognize and receive said ticket, and threatened to put her off the train, and demanded security for her fare over defendant’s line of road; and if the evidence further satisfies your minds that while plaintiff’s wife was such passenger on her return trip, the conductor in charge of defendant’s train acted in a harsh, ungen tlemanly, and oppressive manner toward her, by reason of the fact that the ticket was not signed and stamped, then the plaintiff would be entitled to recover the actual damages occasioned thereby.”
The objections urged to this charge are, that it assumes that a trespasser on defendant’s train was a passenger, and because the charge makes the defendant liable to plaintiff for said injuries and insults, if any, inflicted in transportation by said conductor, because of defendant’s agent’s failure to countersign said ticket at St. Louis, when the pleading and the facts show that the failure of said agent at St. Louis is irrelevant, and too remote and indirect to base said recovery upon in whole or in part. As these assignments practically raise the same question, we will consider them jointly.
The conduct of the agent at St. Louis was an important fact to be alleged and proven in order to show the right of Mrs. Martino as a passenger on appellant’s train, and to negative the idea that she was a trespasser. The averments of the petition show that she, at St. Louis, did all that could reasonably be expected of her in complying with her contract. She tendered the ticket to the agent at St. Louis, with the request that he sign and stamp it; that he refused to do so, giving as a reason that the ticket was not good. The averments of the petition show that the ticket was good, and all that it needed was his signature and stamp. The tender and offer of performance of the contract by Mrs. Martino, and the refusal of the agent to observe it, did not relieve the appellant of its duty to transport her to Dallas. It was the duty of the agent, as shown by the terms of the contract, to sign and stamp it when presented by Mrs. Martino for such purpose Her right to be carried as a passenger on appellant’s train was not lost by reason of the arbitrary refusal of the agent to perform and observe a stipulation of the contract that his-principal had entered into.
The right of passage springs from the contract made with the carrier; the ticket is the evidence of this right; but what is contained therein or omitted therefrom is not in all cases to be considered as conclusive of the rights of the passenger travelling upon the ticket. For the agent issuing, the ticket, or some agent through whose hands it must pass, by reason of negligence or willful failure to perform his duty, may fail or refuse to do-something required by the contract of carriage that should have been done, in order to make the ticket embody the conditions and terms of the contract as actually agreed to. The passenger who complies with his contract does not lose his right to transportation because of the error or mistake of the agent in failing or refusing to do that which is necessary to show the passenger’s right. Under such circumstances it is not incumbent on the passenger to pay an additional fare. He can rely solely on the contract made with the carrier. Pennsylvania Co. v. Bray, 125 Ind.,. 229; Railway v. Mackie, 71 Texas, 491; Wightman v. Chicago, 40 N. W. Rep., 691; Head v. Railway, 7 S. E. Rep., 217; Railway v. Bamley, 16 Atl. Rep., 67.
We do not think there was error in overruling the demurrer, or that the court erred in giving the charge. The charge presents the entire case to the jury growing out of the facts that show the wrongful acts of the agent at St. Louis in refusing to sign and stamp the ticket, and the wrongful acts of the conductors in their conduct towards Mrs. Martino. It leaves them to fix the cause and effect of all these acts from the beginning to the end of the conduct of the parties, at St. Louis and to Denison. We think it was proper that all of these facts should be considered by the jury. The conduct of the agent at St. Louis is admissible for the purpose of showing the effect it produced, and further to negative the fact that Mrs. Martino was a trespasser and to show her right on the train. The case of Mosher v. Railway, 21 American and English Railway Cases, 283, relied on by appellant, is unlike this case. There the purchaser of the round trip ticket that was required to be stamped and signed by the agent did not present it to the agent, and consequently he did not refuse to sign or stamp it. There was no refusal by the agent to do what was agreed should be done that amounted to a violation of the contract. The agent was not present at the ticket office when the holder of the ticket desired that it should be signed and stamped. Without seeing the agent, he boarded the train with the ticket unstamped and unsigned. It was refused by the conductor. In the case before us, there is a violation of the contract, a refusal of the carrier to sign and stamp the ticket as it had agreed to do.
It is contended that the court erred in overruling the demurrer presented by appellant, to the effect, that appellee could not recover for the pain and mental anguish suffered by him; and also, that the court erred in refusing to give a charge asked by appellant to that effect.
It is decided in the case of Telegraph Company v. Cooper, 71 Texas, 507, that pain and mental anguish suffered by the husband on account of injuries inflicted upon the wife can not be considered as an element of damages in a suit to recover damages flowing from such injuries sustained by the wife. While it may have been error in the abstract to have overruled the demurrer, and to have refused the charge, we do not believe it was such error as would require a reversal of this case. The court, in its. charge, pointedly instructed the jury that as an element of damages they could only consider the mental anguish and sense of shame, if any, suffered by Mrs. Martino by reason of the treatment of the conductors, etc. The effect of this charge was to eliminate from the mind of the jury the consideration of any question as to mental anguish and suffering by the husband. The effect of the charge was to piirge the record of any issue of mental suffering experienced by the husband, as presented either by the pleadings or evidence. In fact, giving consideration to all the allegations of the petition, it is doubtful if any claim for the mental suffering of the husband is presented. The evident purpose was to make the sickness, pain, and anguish experienced by the wife the sole basis of the action for damages. It is not seriously contended that the evidence presents a state of facts that show that the husband relied upon his mental distress as an element of damages, or that he sought recovery for such, reason. But upon the contrary, the only logical conclusion that can be-drawn from the evidence is, that it was the anguish and suffering experienced by the wife that the jury considered, or could consider, in rendering a verdict.
It is contended that the verdict of the jury is excessive, and that it is not supported by the evidence. We think the evidence sufficient to support the judgment, and we do not believe the verdict excessive. If the evidence introduced in behalf of the plaintiff is true (which the jury evidently so considered, and we see no reason to doubt the correctness of their conclusion), it presents a case of gross insults and indignities inflicted upon her by a brutal conductor in the employment of appellant,. and while engaged in the performance of service within the line of his duty. At the hour of midnight, among strangers, she was assaulted by the conductor striking her in the presence of others, threatening to then remove her from the train, with her child, if she did not surrender to him her watch and chain. This, after she had exhibited her ticket and explained to him why it was not signed and stamped by the St. Louis agent, and after she had offered to identify herself, and after be had received from the other conductor the baggage check which she had delivered as collateral to secure the payment of her fare to Dallas. Under such circumstances, she, in order to prevent her removal from the train, being without money, surrendered to the conductor her watch and chain.
The physical and mental pain suffered by a lady who has experienced ""the outrages and insults shown to have occurred in this case, can not be measured by anjr standard of value that would limit the jury in awarding her such amount as they in their discretion may see proper. There is no rule in a case of this kind that determines when the amount awarded is excessive. As said in the case of Railway v. Gilbert, 64 Texas, 541: “ It is difficult to compute in figures what sum will repay the plaintiff for the gross insults and physical and mental pain to which she has been subjected by the misconduct and rudeness of the employes of a railway company as detailed by the witnesses in this case. The value of the time lost by her might be estimated, but the damages for her pain of body and mortification of mind must be left largely to the discretion of the jury. When they have not apparently abused this discretion, and no outside influences have been used to excite their passions or prejudices, the result of that discretion must control the judgment of this court on appeal.”
We conclude the case should be affirmed, and so report it."
219260,The City of Denison v. Mary E. Sanford,1893-03-23,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
Appellant is a city of over 1000 inhabitants, incorporated under the general laws of this State applicable to such cities. Gandy Street and Houston Avenue are public streets of said city, recognized and adopted as such. These streets intersect each other, and at their intersection appellant placed two large flat stones, leading from the sidewalk to the crossing. These stones were somewhat inclined, were intended for use by pedestrians, and the verdict of the jury establishes negligence on the part of the city in the manner in which they were placed for such use, and also knowledge on its part of such dangerous condition. Appellant had for several months maintained a light at this crossing, but upon the night in question it was not burning. The verdict also establishes that on the night of May 80,1888, appellee, without negligence on her part, slipped upon the stones above referred to, and by her fall was injured in the manner alleged in her petition, from which she sustained damage to the amount of the verdict, which was $1600. There was a decided conflict in the evidence as to whether or not the construction and use of the stones above referred to was negligence on the part of the city, but under the well settled rules in this State, the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence on this point to sustain it.
Appellant, in its first assignment of error, complains of the action of the court below in overruling a special exception interposed by it to appellee’s original petition, on the ground that such petition did not allege .that she did not have notice of the defective condition of the crossing prior to her injury, but on the contrary, affirmatively shows that she did have such knowledge. We do not construe the petition as showing affirmatively that plaintiff had notice of the defective condition of this crossing, nor do we believe that the petition was defective in failing to .aver affirmatively that she did not have such notice. The law applicable to this case is not that which pertains to the relation of master and servant, under which it is held, that the servant assumes the risk from defects of which he has notice, but it is to be decided according to the rules of law applicable to the duty a city is under in reference to its streets for the protection of the public, who sustain no contractual relation to it. In such cases, it is well settled in this State, that knowledge of the defect by an injured traveller, prior to the injury, is not conclusive evidence of negligence on his part. The question of contributory negligence thus raised is one for the jury under the circumstances of the particular case. Railway v. Gasscamp, 69 Texas, 545; City of Galveston v. Hemmis, 72 Texas, 558; City of Austin v. Ritz, 72 Texas, 391. In such cases, unless plaintiff in stating her case shows contributory negligence on her own part, it would seem to be necessary for the defendant to plead it. For a full decision as to the practice upon this question, see Murray v. Railway, 73 Texas, 2.
Appellant pleaded specially in the court below, that prior to the time when plaintiff was injured, it had entered into a contract with the Denison Gas and Coal Company to furnish to it a certain number of lamps upon its streets, including the one at the crossing where the injury occurred, and that under such contract said company was bound to keep said lamp supplied with gas and burning while it was dark, and that if plaintiff had suffered any injury by reason of said lamp not being lighted, and if there was any fault at all in failing to have it lighted, it was the fault of the said Denison Gas and Coal Company, and it prayed that said company be made a party to said suit, and for judgment over against it.
Plaintiff’s petition charged negligence on the part of the city in the use and construction of the stones referred to above, and also in failing to have this light burning, and appellant in its answer does not allege that the injury to plaintiff was caused solely by the failure to have the lamp lighted. The court below sustained a special exception to this answer, interposed by the gas company, upon the ground that it showed no right of action against it for damages appellant might be compelled to pay by reason of its default or omission concurring with other negligence on the part of the city to cause the injury to plaintiff complained of in her petition. We believe the ruling of the court was correct. Had appellant’s answer, in itself or in connection with the petition of plaintiff, shown that the injury to plaintiff was caused solely by the negligence of the gas company in failing to keep the lamp lighted in compliance with its contract with the city, we are not prepared to hold that the city would not have a right of action against such company for the damage it is compelled to pay appellee. This question is ably and exhaustively treated in the case of The City of Brooklyn v. The Brooklyn City Railway Company, 47 New York, 475. Also, see Chicago v. Robbins, 2 Black, 418: Robbins v. City of Chicago, 71U. S., 657; Cool. on Torts, 2 ed., 170; Armstrong v. Clarion County, 5 Am. Rep., 368; Railway v. Railways, 83 Texas, 509.
It is not, however, necessary for us to decide this question, inasmuch as we construe plaintiff’s petition as charging negligence both upon the part of the city in constructing the crossing and in failing to have the lamp lighted; and under the charge of the court we think the jury must have found such negligence to have existed in reference to the crossing; and under these circumstances, it seems to be well settled, if defendant’s own negligence contributed in causing the injury, it can not have contribution, although its contractor’s negligence may also have contributed thereto. Railway v. Railways, supra, with the other authorities above cited.
We do not believe the evidence fairly raised the issue as to plaintiff’s having been injured by stepping upon rocks not in the crossing of Houston Avenue and Gandy Street, and there was therefore no error in refusing the charge as complained of in the third assignment; nor do we believe the charge of the court to be subject to any of the other objections interposed to it.
It will be seen from the findings of fact that we would not be authorized to reverse the judgment for lack of evidence to support it.
The judgment of the court below will be in all things affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered March 23, 1893."
219182,"Franz Albert v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company",1893-03-23,"HEAD, Associate Justice.
Appellant was the owner of about 10 acres of land within the corporate limits of the city of Gainesville, and in March, 1887, conveyed five-eighths of an acre to J. M. Lindsay by warranty deed, and received a valuable consideration therefor. This deed called for the south line of appellant’s tract, and made no allusion to there being a road or street along this line. This land was conveyed to Lindsay for the use of appellee, and was afterwards conveyed by him to it. Appellee established its yards, round houses, and shops upon this land and land acquired by it from other parties adjoining and south thereof, and erected what is termed its sand house on the south line of the tract so conveyed by appellant, and in such position that it would obstruct the road or street, if such there was, along this line. Appellant instituted this suit,, alleging, that a public road or street had existed along the south line of the land so conveyed by him for a number of years, and that by reason of the obstruction of said street by appellee, he had been damaged by a ■diminution in the rental value oí some houses owned by him near such obstruction.
Appellee answered, denying the existence of such public road or street; and also pleaded estoppel against appellant by reason of his conveyance aforesaid.
Upon the question as to whether or not there was such road or street, the court gave the following instruction to the jury: “To constitute a public highway outside the corporate limits of a town or city, it is necessary that it should have been used by the public as such and recognized as such by the public officials or tribunals of the county through which it runs, having charge of the public roads, by some official act, such as by designating it upon the official records as such, assigning hands to work it, making appropriations for its improvement, or such other acts indicating an acceptance of it as a public highway; and in order to constitute a public highway within the corporate limits of a town or city, it is necessary that it should have been used as such and accepted as such by the city council, by some act assuming control over it, and sufficient, in the opinion of the jury, to establish that it was accepted and recognized by such town or city as a public highway.”
If this were a suit to render the municipality liable for negligence in failing to repair the highway, the definition given by the court would perhaps be unobjectionable, but we are of opinion that it is too restricted when the evidence raises the issue as to whether or not a highway had been dedicated to the public and accepted by it, so as to prohibit the revocation of such dedication. It has been frequently said in this State-, that to render the municipality liable for a failure to repair a highway dedicated to the public, it is necessary that it should be accepted by the municipal authorities, no person having the right to impose this burden upon the public without their consent. Gilder v. The City of Brenham, 67 Texas, 345. And there are expressions in several cases which might be construed as holding that an acceptance by such authorities would be necessary to constitute a public road or street for any purpose. Worthington v. Wade, 82 Texas, 26; Railway v. Montgomery, 85 Texas, 64. But we do not understand any of these cases to go to the extent of holding that a highway which has been dedicated to the public may not be accepted in its behalf in other ways than by affirmative action on the part of the municipal authorities, and we understand several of them to indicate quite the contrary view.
In Worthington v. Wade, supra, it is said: “A road not originally established under the statute may become public by long continued use and adoption as such by the county commissioners, with the assent of the owner or by prescription. A road may also become public, in the sense that the public have the right to use it by dedication. * * * No act of any owner was proven which tended to show an intent to dedicate it to the use of the public. In this State, the mere acquiescence of the owner of -unenclosed land in the use by the public of a road over it is not sufficient evidence of a dedication.” And in Ramthun v. Halfman, 58 Texas, 553, it is said: “A highway may be created by a dedication or donation by the owner of his lands for that purpose, when such dedication has been accepted or recognized as a highway by the proper public authorities, or v)hen the same has been accepted and used as such by the public.” Also, see Railway v. Lee, 70 Texas, 496; Oswald v. Grenet, 22 Texas, 94.
The authorities outside of this State, as to what is necessary to constitute an acceptance of a highway dedicated to the public, are not at all in harmony; but Mr. Elliott, in his work on Roads and Streets, page 117, says, “ This uncertainty is removed by the later authorities, and it may now be considered as the prevailing opinion, that an acceptance may be implied from a general or long continued use by the public as of right;” to sustain which he cites a great number of cases which seem to support his conplusion.
In this case, we are of opinion that there was some evidence which raised the issue as to whether or not this road had been dedicated to the public by the owners of the adjoining land prior to the conveyance by appellant; and we are of opinion that the charge of the court was too restricted, in requiring an acceptance of such dedication to have been evidenced by some affirmative act on the part of the county or city authorities. The charge clearly conveyed to the jury the idea, that there could be no public highway without such action upon the part of the Commissioners Court or the city council, and we think this was error.
The court also gave the following instruction to the jury: “If you find that at the time the plaintiff conveyed to J. M. Lindsay for the railroad the five-eighths of an acre described in the deed from Lindsay to defendant which has been introduced in evidence before you, the plaintiff knew the purpose for which the railroad intended to use said land, and knew that such use would result in the obstruction of said road, then you will find for the defendant, even though you should believe that such road was a public highway; but unless plaintiff knew the purpose for which defendant intended to use said'land, and knew that such use would obstruct the way, he will not be prevented from claiming damages.” We think this charge very clearly states the law applicable to this branch of the case.
Appellee contends, that appellant by his deed would be estopped, even without the knowledge on his part required by this charge, and that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed for this reason, regardless of all other questions; but we can not agree with it in this construction of the deed. A deed to land fronting upon a public highway ordinarily conveys to the grantee the land to the middle of the road, subject to the easement; and we think it will be found, that by far the greater number of these deeds, in describing the land conveyed, call for the line of the owner without, perhaps, in any way alluding to the highway; and in such cases we are not prepared to hold, that the grantor would by his deed be estopped from denying the right of his grantee to close the highway. Wooldridge v. Eastland County, 70 Texas, 680; Day v. Chambers, 62 Texas, 190; Mitchell v. Bass, 26 Texas, 372. But in such cases, if, in addition to his deed, the grantor knows that the purchaser is acquiring the land under the impression that there is no highway, and with the intention of appropriating it to a use inconsistent with the existence of such highway, and with such knowledge receives and appropriates the purchase money for the land, he would be estopped to deny the right of Ms grantee to use it for such purpose.
It seems to be well settled, that evidence of general reputation is admissible on the question as to whether or not a highway is public or private. 1 Greenl. on Ev., secs. 128, 140; Noyes v. Ward, 19 Conn., 269, which is approved in Cox v. The State, 41 Texas, 4.
It is unnecessary for us to decide whether or not the evidence of appellee’s witnesses complained of by appellant was strictly admissible upon this ground or not, as it will hardly be presented in the same form upon another trial.
We see no objection to the county judge testifying as to whether or not this highway was recognized as a public road by the court over which he presided.
For the error in the charge of the court first above indicated, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.
Reversed and remanded.
Delivered March 23, 1893."
219058,M. M. Miller et al. v. Julia A. Vernoy,1893-03-30,"STEPHENS, Associate Justice.
Julia A. Vernoy sued Gf. W. Parsons, her son-in-law, joining his wife also as a defendant, together with M. M. Miller, Mrs. Lou F. White, J. K. P. Jordan, and C. W. Ayres, to cancel certain deeds and a bill of sale made by her to her son-in-law on the 2d day of September, 1882. From the verdict and judgment cancel-ling said deeds, Miller, Jordan, and Ayres have appealed. On the essential matter in dispute there was a conflict in the evidence, but the verdict -of the jury is supported in establishing the following conclusions:
1. That appellee, being in feeble'health, unable to read or write, and without the physical ability to manage and control her property, consisting of lands worth about $10,000 and livestock of the value of about '-$30,000; and reposing implicit confidence in her son-in-law, was deceived and defrauded in the execution of .said conveyances, by which the absolute title to all of said property was placed in him, except a tract of 320 acres, on which was her homestead, which was conveyed to him and his wife jointly.
2. That this fraud consisted in the preparation of the conveyances on his part, in violation of the confidence reposed in him, so as to convey the absolute title, when she did not intend to include the homestead at all, nor to make an absolute conveyance of the other property.
3. That the true nature of the conveyances executed by her was concealed by the son-in-law, who kept the deeds locked in his safe until just before the bringing of this suit.
4. That the appellants, who claim under conveyances from the son-in-law, parted with no new consideration at the time of receiving such conveyances, and that they were not innocent purchasers.
Appellants submit four propositions under the following assignment of error: “ The court erred in overruling defendants’ exceptions to plaintiff’s petition, on the grounds in said exceptions stated.” This assignment is believed to be too general to require us to pass upon these propositions. Miller alone of the appellants filed an answer in the court below, in which are found several exceptions of a diverse character to the petition, raising questions of misjoinder, limitation, etc. Yoe & Harris v. Montgomery, 68 Texas, 340, and cases there cited.
The petition is a long one, but has been examined sufficiently to satisfy us that it states a cause of action, and negatives the idea that by the use of proper diligence appellee could have discovered the alleged fraud in time to have brought this suit sooner. The relation of trust and confideuce by means of which the alleged fraud was accomplished is charged to have continued up to about the time of bringing the suit.
The third assignment of error, under which appellants submit two propositions, is also believed to be too general to require consideration. It reads as follows: “The court erred in its several rulings adverse to defendants in the admission and exclusion of evidence, as shown by their bills of exceptions relating thereto, reserved on the trial, whereby the jury were misled and the defendants prejudiced.” Without determining whether there was error in admitting the testimony as set out in these propositions, we are of opinion that the verdict would probably have been the same had it been excluded.
The fifth assignment, that ‘6 the court erred in refusing defendants’ requested charges correcting alleged errors in the charge in chief,” is also too general to be considered.
The sufficiency of the fourth and only remaining assignment found in appellants’ brief is doubted, as it contains four subdivisions, all leveled at the charge of the court as a whole, upon different grounds, without pointing out any specific portion thereof as erroneous. The first proposition submitted under the fourth and fifth assignments complains of the charge of the court in relation to the statute of limitations; but as no such objection to the charge is found in either of these assignments, it can not be considered. The second proposition submits the objection contained, in the second subdivision of the fourth assignment, that the court “ignored the charge of fraud alleged in the petition, and instructed a, finding for plaintiff on the ground of mistake without proof thereof.”
This specific objection to the charge as a whole is not sustained by the record. In the very beginning of the charge the court instructed the jury, that the burden was on plaintiff, Mrs. Yernoy, to establish her right to a recovery as prayed for, and that by this suit she sought to set aside the conveyances in question on the ground of fraud in their execution and delivery. Again, in the concluding part of the charge, the attention of the jury is called to the fact that appellee could not recover unless her deed to Parsons and wife had been fraudulently obtained, and this suit brought within a reasonable time after the discovery of the fraud. We think, then, it can hardly be said that the charge as a whole ignored the alleged fraud; nor can it be said that it instructed a finding for plaintiff below on the ground of mistake without proof of fraud, as the idea of mistake in the execution of the deeds was not even hinted at, either in the charge or in the evidence. The jury could not have reasonably so understood the charge.
The evidence presented two theories, and two only; the one, that Mrs. Yernoy knowingly and intentionally executed the instruments sought to be cancelled as absolute conveyances, and that her claim to the contrary was an afterthought; the other, that the execution of the instruments in the form of absolute conveyances was the work of the son-in-law, who thereby designedly took advantage of the illiteracy and implicit confidence of Mrs. Vernoy to procure her signature to papers which did not express her intention. Upon this, the only real issue in the case, there was a sharp conflict in the evidence, Mrs. Vernoy testifying in support of the latter theory and Parsons in support of the former. If her testimony was true, that the deeds did not express what she intended them to express, and what she believed at the time they did express, the testimony of Parsons was manifestly false, and his fraud in procuring the deeds an irresistible inference.
While we think the charge on this point was not as full as it probably should have been, still, as applied to the facts of this case, we are not prepared to hold that it was misleading to the- jury. We do not, therefore, in view of the specific objection taken to this charge as a whole, feel warranted in selecting portions thereof which might not be technically correct as grounds for reversing the judgment. «
The other propositions submitted under these assignments challenge the correctness of the charge in reference to the defense of innocent purchaser, interposed by appellant Miller under his general denial of the allegations made by appellee on that issue. It appears from the record ""that Parsons had borrowed of Mrs. White $5000, and that appellants became his sureties on the note. Afterward, in order to protect himself, Miller procured from Parsons and wife a deed to the homestead property, by assuming to pay one-lialf of the debt due Mrs. White. As he parted with nothing of value at the time, and was not placed in any worse position than he had previously occupied, we are of opinion that he can not resist a recovery on this ground.
It follows from these conclusions that the judgment must be affirmed.

219259,J. P. Smith et al. v. J. J. Lang,1893-03-30,"TARLTON, Chief Justice.
This appeal is prosecuted by J. P. Smith, and the City Bank of Sherman from a judgment rendered April 30, 1890, by the District Court of Wichita County, in an action of trespass to try title, wherein J. J. Lang, appellee, as' plaintiff, recovered from appellants, as defendants, seven tracts, or 4936 acres of land.
This land was at one time admittedly the property of the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, and from it, as a common source, the appellants and the appellee deraign title.
Conclusions of Fact.—August 28, 1885, J. J. Lang recovered a judgment for the sum of $26,621 against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company and others, in the District Court of-Wise-County.
December 8, 1886, under a valid alias execution and levy, the land was sold at sheriff’s sale, and Lang became the purchaser thereof. Such is his title.
April 24, 1885, the Boatman Savings Bank recovered a judgment for the sum of 820,740 against J. W. Dabbs, R. M. Henderson, A. A. Henderson, S. G. Tomlinson, Walker Fore, W. J. Morphy, as-principals, and against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, J. W. Wilson, J. W. Sacra, John H. Stone, F. J. Hall, and R. S. Rollins, as endorsers.
June 1, 1886, by virtue of this judgment and alias process issued thereon, the land referred to was sold at sheriff’s sale, J. P. Smith, the appellant, becoming the purchaser. He conveyed to his codefendant, the City Bank of Sherman, an undivided one-fourth interest, by deed dated February 25, 1888. This constitutes the title of appellants.
In July,. 1884, R. M. Henderson, one of the principal debtors in the judgment of the Boatman Savings Bank v. J. W. Dabbs et al., delivered to R. S. Rollins, one of the endorsers upon the note upon which that judgment was rendered, two notes against J. P. Smith, J. B. Reed, and E. G. Thurmond. The purpose of this transfer and delivery was to secure Rollins, the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, and the other endorsers upon the note to the Boatman Savings Bank.
On November 11, 1885, judgment was had against Smith, Reed, and Thurmond for the sum of 88250 on one of these collateral security notes; and on the same day the Boatman Savings Bank recovered a judgment against the same defendants upon the other one of the notes for the sum of $8250. A stay of execution on both these judgments was had until June 1, 1886.
March 2, 1886, the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company transferred to F. M. Daugherty, subject to the interest of the Boatman Savings Bank, the two judgments last mentioned.
On May 20, 1886, the Boatman Savings Bank, by its attorneys, transferred, in consideration of the sum of $8537.35, to J. P. Smith the judgment of the Boatman Savings Bank v. J. W. Dabbs et al.
The consideration paid by Smith, $8537.35, was the exact amount then remaining due upon the judgment in favor of the Boatman Savings Bank v. J. W. Dabbs et al. The amount due upon the two judgments against Smith, Reed, and Thurmond, held, as above indicated, by the Boatman Savings Bank as collateral security, was $16,500, with interest at 10 per cent from their date.
On May 20, 1886, the date of the transfer by the Boatman Savings Bank through its attorneys to Smith, the latter held against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company four promissory notes, as follows:
1. A note for $9200, dated August 1, 1884, with 10 per cent interest from date, payable one year after date to the order of S. A. McAdams, endorsed by him in blank, and credited September 1, 1885, with $2540.
2. A note for $6583, dated July 1, 1884, with 10 per cent interest per annum from date, payable one year after date to the order of J. M. Rols, and by him endorsed in blank, and credited September 1, 1885, with $7140.
3. A note for $3982.75, dated July 1, 1884, with 12 per cent interest from date, payable one day after date, to the order of J. M. Rols, and by him endorsed in blank, and credited January 12, 1885, with $500.
4. A note for $8781.66|, dated July 15, 1884, with 10 per cent interest from date, payable one year after date to the order of R. McCubbin, and by him endorsed in blank, and credited September 1, 1885, with $5140.
Conclusions of Lato.—Under the foregoing facts, we concur with the trial court, that the Boatman Savings Bank was subrogated, as regards the judgments against Smith, Reed, and Thurmond, to the rights of the original owners of those judgments, Henderson, Dabbs, and others, principals in the main judgment, and of Rollins, the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, and others who were sureties therein. Coleb. on Coll. Secur., secs. 217, 212. These collateral judgments against Smith and others were held by the Boatman Savings Bank as a pledge to secure the payment of the original judgment against Dabbs and others. As a pledge, they were an incident to the debt evidenced by the main judgment, and were so transferable with the latter. Coleb. on Coll. Secur., sec. 79, p. 107; Freem. on Judg., sec. 431; The Batesville Inst. v. Kaufman, 18 Wall., 151.
We fail to appreciate the distinction, in this respect, sought to be drawn by appellants’ counsel between a pledge and a mortgage. The thing pledged ,• in its character as a security, is as much an incident of the debt intended thereby to be secured as would be a mortgage. The transfer of the main judgment to Smith operated as a transfer of the collateral, and going thus hand in hand, so to speak, the latter, to the extent of the former, must be held to have operated as a cancellation of the former. Otherwise it will have altogether lost its character as a pledge for the former. It is not to be questioned, that had Smith paid to the Boatman Savings Bank the amount of the collateral judgments against himself, such payment would to the extent thereof have discharged the main judgment. Unless the converse be true, the purpose with which the Boatman Savings Bank held the collateral judgments would be defeated, and Dabbs, with the remaining principals, and the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company and the remaining sureties on the main judgment, would be deprived of all benefit from the collateral held for them by the Boatman Savings Bank. It would seem that payment, under such circumstances, of the one judgment would operate pro tanto to extinguish the others, and vice versa. Freem. on Judg., sec. 467.
When Smith took a transfer from the Boatman Savings Bank of the judgment against Dabbs, Henderson, and others as principals, and the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company as endorsers, it can not be so accurately said that he purchased the judgment as that he paid it. And this is true, because he owed the amount which he paid; not indeed for the reason that he was directly a party to the judgment which was transferred to him, but for the reason that he was a debtor in two judgments held by the transferrer as a security and a pledge for the judgment transferred, and that as between himself and the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company he was primarily liable. His obligations, reduced to judgments, were held by the Boatman Savings Bank as a security for the obligation of Dabbs and of the cattle company which he purports to have purchased. When he, with J. D. Reed and E. G-. Thurmond, executed the notes on which were founded the judgments against him, he contracted that these notes might be assigned by their holders as a pledge or security for any debt which might be due by them. He must be held then to have contracted for their payment in contemplation of the fact that they might or would be assigned to the Boatman Savings Bank (as to any other person, natural or artificial), to whom their payees might become indebted. He is not, under the facts stated, to be regarded as occupying the attitude of a stranger, taking as such an assignment of the judgment. He did not purchase it; he paid it. Otherwise the very purpose for which his primary obligations had been legitimately pledged would be defeated.
It can not be said that this interpretation of the transaction produces a result which will operate as a hardship upon Smith. The money paid by him upon the principal judgment will have been applied to the payment of his own obligations, and in a manner which might be considered as within his contemplation at the time he bound himself by the promissory notes afterwards pledged to secure the debt of their holders. The latter will have secured the benefit of the collateral securities, legitimately obtained and pledged by them to the payment of their obligation; and the Boatman Savings Bank, the pledgee, will have collected the amount justly due it. Thus, ‘ ‘ all things ’ ’ between the several parties 11 will have been made even,” and the behests of equity fully subserved.
The fact, insisted upon by appellant, that at the time of the transfer by the Boatman Savings Bank to Smith the latter held other notes of the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, does not affect the conclusion above expressed. These notes can not, as we think, be used to thus defeat the specific purpose with which the judgments against Smith were pledged, not only in the interest of the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, but also of its cosureties and others, principals in the main judgment.
The further fact which appellants sought to prove, that in 1888, F. M. Daugherty, assignee (subject to the rights of the Boatman Savings Bank) of the collateral judgments, brought suit against Smith to revive these judgments, is alike, in our opinion, immaterial. That suit and the issues therein involved must be regarded as “ res inter alios acta.”
Nor do we find merit in the contention of appellants against the admissibility of the testimony of the witness Rollins, wherein he refers to the notes against Smith, Reed, and Thurmond, giving the names of those who signed them, and stating their date and amounts and the particular notes on which the judgments against Smith, Reed, and Thurmond were rendered. The character of these notes as pledges was the issuable fact in this connection. This fact rested in paroi. It could not be otherwise proved, because it did not otherwise exist. The notes themselves were merged in judgments and the judgments were read in evidence. We do not think that it was improper that the witness should be permitted, in explanation of this issuable fact, to state, without producing the notes themselves, the date and amount thereof and the names of the signers, and to trace them to the judgments, which were themselves introduced. This testimony seems to us to have been but collateral to the main issue. 1 Greenl., sec. 89.
The further fact, that at the date of the transfer to Smith the collateral judgments were not mature, is also, in our opinion, immaterial, since they were mature on June 1, 1886, the date of his purchase at the sheriff’s sale. As in our opinion the judgment on which this sale rested had been by Smith, in the manner above indicated; paid off and satisfied, there was then and is now no basis for appellants’ title.
The judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed.
Delivered March 30, 1893."
